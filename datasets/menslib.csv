2020-11-27 01:11:46,Musing on masculinity and coopetition.,"The topic of human social competition has very much whirled about my noggin for the past week now, especially as it relates to men's in contests and gendered displays and how they tie into issues that are often discussed in this sub.

So, first things first: ""What is coopetition?""
Coopetition is a very annoying to pronounce word that describes a situation where cooperation and competition exist together in the same or overlapping endeavor, for example, something wherein a small group of people must work together to succeed, but the person that brings the most value to the cause gets to ""win"" or enjoy additional benefits.

As humans, we owe our successes to our intensely social abilities that allow us to work together, allowing us to become more than the sum of our parts.
However, as anyone of us who ever participated in a group project might point out, not everyone is equal in ability or commitment, some people have different qualities or specializations, as a result, members of the group start deferring to other individual members they trust on specific matters, allowing a loose sorta hierarchy to form.

This is where the competitive part comes in.
You see, as this intensely social species that we are, we crave and need security and affirmation, thankfully we also tend to enjoy giving such to people we like, but it doesn't come on its own, just like the members of group projects I addressed earlier, freeloaders and underachievers are despised as dead weight, you need to work for those social rewards, the more you contribute, the better.

Now in the above abstract example, I only mention things like affirmation and affection, but you'll probably figure much more is at stake most of the time, even a lot of social animals do this, especially when it comes to the ability to mate, or rather, the approval  to mate.

This social  success is more than just vanity,  in fact, a complete lack of it would leave you abandoned by your group, which would spell destitution and starvation for most of history, even if the group itself succeeded, one might still perish simply for lacking the social success to share in that benefit, to lose the social competition is deadly, and thats without considering extreme circumstances like, for example, famine or war, that may radically raise the bar for success.
On the flipside, being highly succesful at this social competition may get you hreat benefits and boons, even if one doesn't even deliberately intents to come out on top, these social benefits are bestowed by their peers both within their ""team"" and those outside of it that benefit from their work.
In different words, everyone celebrates a succesful group of foragers, but their most keen tracker gets special attention.

How does this relate to masculinity?
Well, people aren't stupid, even at a young age, we can observe firsthand what the benefits of such ""popularity"" are and what happens if you fall to the bottom of the pile, even if you're not being bullied or cast out, staying invisible forever can hurt too and I see a big drive in a lot of young men who want to ""prove themselves"", in fact, tons of elaborate traditions base themselves around that sentiment for better or for worse.
It can be easy to scoff at these traditions, though one should be mindful of the drive that motivates them, nobody wants to be counted among the ""unneeded"" or ""unwanted"" men, historically speaking, many societies cast out the people they felt they could not support, sending them away to fend for themselves, often resulting bands of bandits and poachers that try to scratch out a living, some even turning to raiding to ""prove their contribution"" to their community in the form of loot.

In our modern age, at least in the west, things aren't quite so grim, we don't banish our jobless boys into the woods to ""become men"" and we have tons of different social circles we can approach, both online and off, however, social competition remains an incredible factor in our interactions and can have profound effects on our prospects, health and happiness.
Old themes are still prevalent as well, as socially unsuccessful men feel neglected, lonely, hurt and/or ignored, with all manners of ill effects and results.

But all is not blackpill, thankfully, for we are an obnoxiously cooperative species still, the same way one can make it to the top by sabotaging others, so too can one become extremely successful by building up those around them, treasured leaders give credit to their comrades, good friends improve one another's lives, heck, we are pretty unique as a species in that we actively contribute to the romantic and sexual success of our peers (wingmen and matchmakers, anyone?).

Make no mistake, this social competition is largely subconscious to most people and not something deliberately and arbitrarily imposed (unless they start making up rules or arbitrary practices, of course), nor does a lack of success always lie in one's own control.

I don't really have a good closing thought or statement, I mainly just wanted to share my thoughts here and see what you guys think of it.
I do realize its a lot to unpack.",True,16,0.84,1,,/r/MensLib/comments/k1j29y/musing_on_masculinity_and_coopetition/,Shieldheart-

2020-11-25 08:10:25,Anyone else struggle to make friends?,"I'm a man in my 30s and I'd say I don't have any friends. It's actually hard for me to even type this and talk about it, but I know social isolation is problem lots of people are facing these days.

I have a family, kids and a wife, a full-time job in an industry I enjoy and we are financially secure. Because I feel fortunate about my circumstances, I feel bad complaining about not having any friends. I used to have friends, when I was younger but I moved to a new city, started my family and lost contact with all my old friends, who were on a different path (partying and dating still, which is fine for them but it was hard to talk to them about it).

The thing is I'm likable and people like hanging out with me. I'm introverted but only slightly. I enjoy going out with groups and being sociable. 

I've known several other guys who are similar to me (young fathers, mid-career), normally through work but I always struggle to make the leap to having them as friends. Eventually, I switch jobs and we lose contact. In the back of my head, I'm always thinking 'oh they don't actually like me, they already have a friends network, its too difficult to maintain a friendship with a family and job'.

It would be great to have some friends who I could grab a beer with sometimes or have our kids play together or talk sports or whatever. 

Anyway I'd love to hear any suggestions for building a friend/support network as an adult.",True,74,0.96,28,,/r/MensLib/comments/k0h36o/anyone_else_struggle_to_make_friends/,Gradatim-Ferociter

2020-11-24 03:08:13,I decided that I need to get help,"I was in denial that there was a problem for over a year. Sure, I wasn't in a fantastic state of mind, but I didn't need ""professional help"" or something. I'd be fine. I lost passion for hobbies, life, and my relationship. I even thought the relationship was the problem. I thought that it was just life being shitty, and that id eventually adjust. And I did, in some ways. But my overall mental health has seemed to come in waves. With peaks and valleys. Last week I was practically petrified with anxiety and depression and guilt. It might've been the worst I've ever felt mentally. I finally decided that I needed to get help.

2020-11-23 03:13:17,Confessions of an unmasculine black man,"It didn't take me very long even as a kid to realize that I didn't really fit the societal image of what a black man should be. But I thought that maybe I'd grow into it as a got older. I just turned 32, and no such luck.

I never did grow into common cultural image of black men as tall, muscular, sexy, confident and a large penis, **MASCULINE**. Masculinity is like a defining trait for black men. Instead I'm short, geeky with a smaller than average penis(and not just the ""black men average"").

I never even thought about it too much until a former partner of mine told her friend ( who thought I should know), her surprise that I had a ""*pencil dick*"". Doing tons of internet research, only to find out she was right, was very devastating to my self worth. Black men are synonymous with large penises. It's our trademark. What makes us special. I've never felt so uniquely unlovable.

That, and I'm also a coward. The thought of getting into a fight frightens me. I know protection is something that women value highly, but even being in the presence of a fight  gives me heart palpitations, and weak knees. 

I'm so insecure, I've even begun to think I'd rather not have kids incase I end up with a boy. I'd hate to give them my genetic short comings. And even if I didn't, would I end up being jealous of them?

2020-11-21 17:37:56,Fasting from complaints,"Today I started a 16 day fasting from complaints for the second time.

The first time I did one was at the beginning of last year and it helped me get started in developing healthier thoughts and a more positive attitude to life, to myself and to other people.

I haven't really given a lot of thought as to why I'm doing it this time around. The opportunity came to me and I'm looking forward to it and to seeing what will happen.

\-----

Edit 1: That means I promised myself today **to try and not complain** or gossip or be overly critical with myself or others but instead to find a more positive and constructive way of thinking wherever possible. The very first step to this is learning to be mindful of one's thoughts.

Edit 2: To avoid confusion, the aim is not to suppress any thoughts. Every thought is welcome, especially the negative thoughts. Thoughts (and emotions) can't and shouldn't be suppressed. That is super unhealthy.

Rather the aim of this fasting is to become more aware and more mindful of your behaviour and, later on: of your thoughts. The first important part is to observe one's own behaviour and be aware of what is happening. The second important part is to approach everything(!) you encounter with kindness - to yourself, to your thoughts, to your behaviour. The only way we as humans ever change is *if and when we really want to change.* And voluntary change doesn't happen by force or by negativity, it only happens by choice.

The simplified outset here is that we react negatively to a situation because we don't see any other way of reacting, i.e. we do not have a choice. The aim of this fasting therefore, to some extent, is to regain my power of seeing that I do have a choice in a) which thoughts I choose and in b) which thoughts I give more power. I kept the post fairly simple, originally, because I didn't want to dive into all the details but there's some confusion that I'd like to hopefully address.",True,774,0.96,53,,/r/MensLib/comments/jy84rj/fasting_from_complaints/,norfkens2

2020-11-21 07:27:33,Facing patriarchal sexual shame and worthlessness,"Warning this post is really long!

At long last I feel I'm able to address a lot of the shame that has been driving me my whole life. It's difficult to put these thoughts into words when it's the air you've breathed for so long.

**Lifelong layers of shame**

I grew up in a very conservative culture that frowned upon interactions between the opposite sex but, constantly idealised romantic love in the culture - in the form of romcoms/drama movies, TV, folklore/stories/mythology/fairytales etc.

After watching such movies/TV I've had these social milestones in my head of when you **should** have your first kiss, relationship, sex, marriage, children etc. But I haven't been able to move towards any of that because there have literally never been any girls in my life - *by design*.

I went to a boys school and studied Engineering at college (before dropping out). In all cases there have been no women around me and yet the expectation (internal and external from my family) that I should have my girlfriend/partner sorted out.

I'm still a virgin, have never had a relationship and am not very good with women. But worst of all are the feelings of shame, worthlessness and self-loathing.

Underlying all of this is the belief that **I am owed sex/companionship and if I can't secure that I'm a loser.**

It's so myopic that it doesn't acknowledge women have free-will just as I do and can act as they wish. Their choices is not a reflection of my worth.

**Unravelling toxic masculinity and misogyny**

I still have a lot of toxic masculinity that I struggle to even acknowledge these feelings. Part of it is because I feel that men shouldn't complain and suck it up. I live in a first-world country, am financially secure, have good career prospects, family, friends, am not subject to sexism, able-bodied etc.

It's a harsh way to think, but I think I've resisted examining such beliefs because it's painful. I'm gradually coming to terms with a healthier perspective

* No one owes you sex or companionship
   * I can respect and accept women more if I think in this way.
   * I am able to let go of subtle sexist perspectives.
* You're not a loser if you're single or a virgin.

We should stop trying to placate feelings by telling people to always try harder or stay hopeful and acknowledge that a lot of people in the world may go without romantic love - as they probably have in the past.

* Try your very best, but regardless of the outcome you have worth.
* You don't need this as much as you think you do, it's mostly social conditioning.
* Society may idolise materialistic black-and-white notions of success, but there is much more to life.

**The legacy of patriarchy**

Moreover, I think the driving force behind patriarchy is a blunt carrot and stick. The shame of losing out on a partner and the incentive of an attractive trophy wife if you ""climb to the top"". In most instances there is a core of shame, insecurity and fear. People are working to avoid failure.

I think such deep shame is creating incel and Red Pill sub-cultures. When you couple this with an unconscious entitlement to sex/companionship it's no surprise that first boys/men view themselves as losers and then act out of indignation in sexist ways.",True,165,0.94,40,,/r/MensLib/comments/jy00c6/facing_patriarchal_sexual_shame_and_worthlessness/,ThatGuyWeLike87

2020-11-21 06:40:44,Should beards be be protected characteristic?,"I'm saying this because when I once had my Viking worthy beard, I noticed how very hostile and judgemental people were to conform to their clean shaven male standards.

When I had a short trim beard, the social pressure wasn't quite as extreme, however when I grew it out, I had lots of colleagues (most female ones) shaming me into trimming it down or removing it. My parents constantly told me to shave it off to the point where they joked they were going to pin me down and remove it themselves. Mystery birthday gifts became razors and scissors. The only people that tended to be supportive were my male friends and male colleagues. Some of them actually encouraged me to to keep going and made comments of admiration.

Once my female boss had enough and made it quite clear, by then I got so fed up with all the criticism, that I began removing my beard. To be fair, by this stage the hair was getting quite annoying and hard to manage. I found it hard keeping it combed, straightened, and sanitary. Food and drink had to be consumed carefully. And when I woke up in the morning sometimes had a split bent beard!

I thought about this again recently. I remember distinctly feeling sad at losing my beard. It grew to be a part of my identity, and removing it felt like cutting off a limb. It was endearing when a little kid would call you Thor or something. It also gave me something to grow out when my hair was balding.

I thought about the call of late for other protected characteristics like being a Goth, or having tattoos/piercings ect. Employers can particularly hostile to nonconformity in regards to dress code and looks. But with beards, we are so far behind when it comes to this kind of stuff.

I've gotten women giving me weird looks before or under breath comments, but today was different. I was in a Dicks sports store with my 4 year old.  He was just on the other side of the short 4 foot display with me plainly in sight.  A woman came over and asked where his mommy was.  I said that he was my son.  She scowled at me and asked him again where his mommy was.  He said at home.  I went over and grabbed his hand shuffling him away from her.  I repeated that he was my son.  She left in a huff. 

It's so weird, I've heard stories like this before, but I didn't think it would happen to me. 

There is something wrong with society that a father gets questioned like this.  I've posted before here about my troubles finding changing tables in men's rooms while my boys were in diapers. It's like we cannot accept that fathers could be out, taking care of their kids.

2020-11-20 06:31:48,A female Coworker has been touching me,"Last week one of my coworkers, a lady in her late forties (I'm 32), slapped my butt as I walked past her. Other people were present but I don't know if any of them noticed. I then turned around and said in an angry tone ""did you really just slap my ass?"" to which she jokingly replied something like ""guys need a good spanking every now and then"" (sounded like she tried to turn it into a joke after my negative reaction). The whole event felt so weird to me that I was at a loss and left it at that. 

We're friendly and on a first name basis, which is common at my job. She also has been making suggestive jokes in the past in which I engaged a bit since i considered it to be merely light hearted humor. There has been no flirting (certainly not from me).
However none of this should matter I guess, but I'm trying to give you the whole picture.

But this wasn't the first time she touched me inappropriately. A few months ago we were joking around and she poked me in the belly. She felt my abs and started to run her hands over my stomach. I just stood there dumbfounded for a second until I snapped out of it, took a step back and angrily said something like ""what the hell are you doing?"" 

Honestly, I don't know how to feel about this.
I don't feel shocked, I'm not uncomfortable at my job because of it or scared of encountering her again, but I kinda feel like I should be mad, even though I don't really know why. I'm just confused.
I know I should just talk to her and explain that I don't want her to touch me. And that'll be the end of it, I'm certain. But on the other hand I feel somewhat silly to make a big deal out of this. After all, it wasn't traumatizing or anything since I know that I could always gain control over the situation and I'm not at her mercy (btw she is not my supervisor). 

I don't really know what I'm trying to get out of posting this. Maybe just talk about it. Like I said, I'm mostly confused. Have any of you experienced this? How did you react? And how did it turn out?

Edit: 
Thank you all so much for your helpful, positive and encouraging feedback.
Due to Covid-related reasons management placed me in another building, where I won't be seeing her anyway until January.
I have thought about it and I am certain now, that, as some of you have already suggested, she has not been acting with malicious intent, but rather plain old ignorance.

2020-11-27 01:11:46,Musing on masculinity and coopetition.,"The topic of human social competition has very much whirled about my noggin for the past week now, especially as it relates to men's in contests and gendered displays and how they tie into issues that are often discussed in this sub.

So, first things first: ""What is coopetition?""
Coopetition is a very annoying to pronounce word that describes a situation where cooperation and competition exist together in the same or overlapping endeavor, for example, something wherein a small group of people must work together to succeed, but the person that brings the most value to the cause gets to ""win"" or enjoy additional benefits.

As humans, we owe our successes to our intensely social abilities that allow us to work together, allowing us to become more than the sum of our parts.
However, as anyone of us who ever participated in a group project might point out, not everyone is equal in ability or commitment, some people have different qualities or specializations, as a result, members of the group start deferring to other individual members they trust on specific matters, allowing a loose sorta hierarchy to form.

This is where the competitive part comes in.
You see, as this intensely social species that we are, we crave and need security and affirmation, thankfully we also tend to enjoy giving such to people we like, but it doesn't come on its own, just like the members of group projects I addressed earlier, freeloaders and underachievers are despised as dead weight, you need to work for those social rewards, the more you contribute, the better.

Now in the above abstract example, I only mention things like affirmation and affection, but you'll probably figure much more is at stake most of the time, even a lot of social animals do this, especially when it comes to the ability to mate, or rather, the approval  to mate.

This social  success is more than just vanity,  in fact, a complete lack of it would leave you abandoned by your group, which would spell destitution and starvation for most of history, even if the group itself succeeded, one might still perish simply for lacking the social success to share in that benefit, to lose the social competition is deadly, and thats without considering extreme circumstances like, for example, famine or war, that may radically raise the bar for success.
On the flipside, being highly succesful at this social competition may get you hreat benefits and boons, even if one doesn't even deliberately intents to come out on top, these social benefits are bestowed by their peers both within their ""team"" and those outside of it that benefit from their work.
In different words, everyone celebrates a succesful group of foragers, but their most keen tracker gets special attention.

How does this relate to masculinity?
Well, people aren't stupid, even at a young age, we can observe firsthand what the benefits of such ""popularity"" are and what happens if you fall to the bottom of the pile, even if you're not being bullied or cast out, staying invisible forever can hurt too and I see a big drive in a lot of young men who want to ""prove themselves"", in fact, tons of elaborate traditions base themselves around that sentiment for better or for worse.
It can be easy to scoff at these traditions, though one should be mindful of the drive that motivates them, nobody wants to be counted among the ""unneeded"" or ""unwanted"" men, historically speaking, many societies cast out the people they felt they could not support, sending them away to fend for themselves, often resulting bands of bandits and poachers that try to scratch out a living, some even turning to raiding to ""prove their contribution"" to their community in the form of loot.

In our modern age, at least in the west, things aren't quite so grim, we don't banish our jobless boys into the woods to ""become men"" and we have tons of different social circles we can approach, both online and off, however, social competition remains an incredible factor in our interactions and can have profound effects on our prospects, health and happiness.
Old themes are still prevalent as well, as socially unsuccessful men feel neglected, lonely, hurt and/or ignored, with all manners of ill effects and results.

But all is not blackpill, thankfully, for we are an obnoxiously cooperative species still, the same way one can make it to the top by sabotaging others, so too can one become extremely successful by building up those around them, treasured leaders give credit to their comrades, good friends improve one another's lives, heck, we are pretty unique as a species in that we actively contribute to the romantic and sexual success of our peers (wingmen and matchmakers, anyone?).

Make no mistake, this social competition is largely subconscious to most people and not something deliberately and arbitrarily imposed (unless they start making up rules or arbitrary practices, of course), nor does a lack of success always lie in one's own control.

I don't really have a good closing thought or statement, I mainly just wanted to share my thoughts here and see what you guys think of it.

I have a family, kids and a wife, a full-time job in an industry I enjoy and we are financially secure. Because I feel fortunate about my circumstances, I feel bad complaining about not having any friends. I used to have friends, when I was younger but I moved to a new city, started my family and lost contact with all my old friends, who were on a different path (partying and dating still, which is fine for them but it was hard to talk to them about it).

The thing is I'm likable and people like hanging out with me. I'm introverted but only slightly. I enjoy going out with groups and being sociable. 

I've known several other guys who are similar to me (young fathers, mid-career), normally through work but I always struggle to make the leap to having them as friends. Eventually, I switch jobs and we lose contact. In the back of my head, I'm always thinking 'oh they don't actually like me, they already have a friends network, its too difficult to maintain a friendship with a family and job'.

It would be great to have some friends who I could grab a beer with sometimes or have our kids play together or talk sports or whatever.

I never did grow into common cultural image of black men as tall, muscular, sexy, confident and a large penis, **MASCULINE**. Masculinity is like a defining trait for black men. Instead I'm short, geeky with a smaller than average penis(and not just the ""black men average"").

I never even thought about it too much until a former partner of mine told her friend ( who thought I should know), her surprise that I had a ""*pencil dick*"". Doing tons of internet research, only to find out she was right, was very devastating to my self worth. Black men are synonymous with large penises. It's our trademark. What makes us special. I've never felt so uniquely unlovable.

That, and I'm also a coward. The thought of getting into a fight frightens me. I know protection is something that women value highly, but even being in the presence of a fight  gives me heart palpitations, and weak knees. 

I'm so insecure, I've even begun to think I'd rather not have kids incase I end up with a boy. I'd hate to give them my genetic short comings. And even if I didn't, would I end up being jealous of them?

2020-11-21 17:37:56,Fasting from complaints,"Today I started a 16 day fasting from complaints for the second time.

The first time I did one was at the beginning of last year and it helped me get started in developing healthier thoughts and a more positive attitude to life, to myself and to other people.

I haven't really given a lot of thought as to why I'm doing it this time around. The opportunity came to me and I'm looking forward to it and to seeing what will happen.

\-----

Edit 1: That means I promised myself today **to try and not complain** or gossip or be overly critical with myself or others but instead to find a more positive and constructive way of thinking wherever possible. The very first step to this is learning to be mindful of one's thoughts.

Edit 2: To avoid confusion, the aim is not to suppress any thoughts. Every thought is welcome, especially the negative thoughts. Thoughts (and emotions) can't and shouldn't be suppressed. That is super unhealthy.

Rather the aim of this fasting is to become more aware and more mindful of your behaviour and, later on: of your thoughts. The first important part is to observe one's own behaviour and be aware of what is happening. The second important part is to approach everything(!) you encounter with kindness - to yourself, to your thoughts, to your behaviour. The only way we as humans ever change is *if and when we really want to change.* And voluntary change doesn't happen by force or by negativity, it only happens by choice.

The simplified outset here is that we react negatively to a situation because we don't see any other way of reacting, i.e. we do not have a choice. The aim of this fasting therefore, to some extent, is to regain my power of seeing that I do have a choice in a) which thoughts I choose and in b) which thoughts I give more power. I kept the post fairly simple, originally, because I didn't want to dive into all the details but there's some confusion that I'd like to hopefully address.",True,779,0.96,53,,/r/MensLib/comments/jy84rj/fasting_from_complaints/,norfkens2

2020-11-21 07:27:33,Facing patriarchal sexual shame and worthlessness,"Warning this post is really long!

At long last I feel I'm able to address a lot of the shame that has been driving me my whole life. It's difficult to put these thoughts into words when it's the air you've breathed for so long.

**Lifelong layers of shame**

I grew up in a very conservative culture that frowned upon interactions between the opposite sex but, constantly idealised romantic love in the culture - in the form of romcoms/drama movies, TV, folklore/stories/mythology/fairytales etc.

After watching such movies/TV I've had these social milestones in my head of when you **should** have your first kiss, relationship, sex, marriage, children etc. But I haven't been able to move towards any of that because there have literally never been any girls in my life - *by design*.

I went to a boys school and studied Engineering at college (before dropping out). In all cases there have been no women around me and yet the expectation (internal and external from my family) that I should have my girlfriend/partner sorted out.

I'm still a virgin, have never had a relationship and am not very good with women. But worst of all are the feelings of shame, worthlessness and self-loathing.

Underlying all of this is the belief that **I am owed sex/companionship and if I can't secure that I'm a loser.**

It's so myopic that it doesn't acknowledge women have free-will just as I do and can act as they wish. Their choices is not a reflection of my worth.

**Unravelling toxic masculinity and misogyny**

I still have a lot of toxic masculinity that I struggle to even acknowledge these feelings. Part of it is because I feel that men shouldn't complain and suck it up. I live in a first-world country, am financially secure, have good career prospects, family, friends, am not subject to sexism, able-bodied etc.

It's a harsh way to think, but I think I've resisted examining such beliefs because it's painful. I'm gradually coming to terms with a healthier perspective

* No one owes you sex or companionship
   * I can respect and accept women more if I think in this way.
   * I am able to let go of subtle sexist perspectives.
* You're not a loser if you're single or a virgin.

We should stop trying to placate feelings by telling people to always try harder or stay hopeful and acknowledge that a lot of people in the world may go without romantic love - as they probably have in the past.

* Try your very best, but regardless of the outcome you have worth.
* You don't need this as much as you think you do, it's mostly social conditioning.
* Society may idolise materialistic black-and-white notions of success, but there is much more to life.

**The legacy of patriarchy**

Moreover, I think the driving force behind patriarchy is a blunt carrot and stick. The shame of losing out on a partner and the incentive of an attractive trophy wife if you ""climb to the top"". In most instances there is a core of shame, insecurity and fear. People are working to avoid failure.

I think such deep shame is creating incel and Red Pill sub-cultures. When you couple this with an unconscious entitlement to sex/companionship it's no surprise that first boys/men view themselves as losers and then act out of indignation in sexist ways.",True,160,0.94,40,,/r/MensLib/comments/jy00c6/facing_patriarchal_sexual_shame_and_worthlessness/,ThatGuyWeLike87

2020-11-21 06:40:44,Should beards be be protected characteristic?,"I'm saying this because when I once had my Viking worthy beard, I noticed how very hostile and judgemental people were to conform to their clean shaven male standards.

When I had a short trim beard, the social pressure wasn't quite as extreme, however when I grew it out, I had lots of colleagues (most female ones) shaming me into trimming it down or removing it. My parents constantly told me to shave it off to the point where they joked they were going to pin me down and remove it themselves. Mystery birthday gifts became razors and scissors. The only people that tended to be supportive were my male friends and male colleagues. Some of them actually encouraged me to to keep going and made comments of admiration.

Once my female boss had enough and made it quite clear, by then I got so fed up with all the criticism, that I began removing my beard. To be fair, by this stage the hair was getting quite annoying and hard to manage. I found it hard keeping it combed, straightened, and sanitary. Food and drink had to be consumed carefully. And when I woke up in the morning sometimes had a split bent beard!

I thought about this again recently. I remember distinctly feeling sad at losing my beard. It grew to be a part of my identity, and removing it felt like cutting off a limb. It was endearing when a little kid would call you Thor or something. It also gave me something to grow out when my hair was balding.

I thought about the call of late for other protected characteristics like being a Goth, or having tattoos/piercings ect. Employers can particularly hostile to nonconformity in regards to dress code and looks. But with beards, we are so far behind when it comes to this kind of stuff.

2020-11-20 06:31:48,A female Coworker has been touching me,"Last week one of my coworkers, a lady in her late forties (I'm 32), slapped my butt as I walked past her. Other people were present but I don't know if any of them noticed. I then turned around and said in an angry tone ""did you really just slap my ass?"" to which she jokingly replied something like ""guys need a good spanking every now and then"" (sounded like she tried to turn it into a joke after my negative reaction). The whole event felt so weird to me that I was at a loss and left it at that. 

We're friendly and on a first name basis, which is common at my job. She also has been making suggestive jokes in the past in which I engaged a bit since i considered it to be merely light hearted humor. There has been no flirting (certainly not from me).
However none of this should matter I guess, but I'm trying to give you the whole picture.

But this wasn't the first time she touched me inappropriately. A few months ago we were joking around and she poked me in the belly. She felt my abs and started to run her hands over my stomach. I just stood there dumbfounded for a second until I snapped out of it, took a step back and angrily said something like ""what the hell are you doing?"" 

Honestly, I don't know how to feel about this.
I don't feel shocked, I'm not uncomfortable at my job because of it or scared of encountering her again, but I kinda feel like I should be mad, even though I don't really know why. I'm just confused.
I know I should just talk to her and explain that I don't want her to touch me. And that'll be the end of it, I'm certain. But on the other hand I feel somewhat silly to make a big deal out of this. After all, it wasn't traumatizing or anything since I know that I could always gain control over the situation and I'm not at her mercy (btw she is not my supervisor). 

I don't really know what I'm trying to get out of posting this. Maybe just talk about it. Like I said, I'm mostly confused. Have any of you experienced this? How did you react? And how did it turn out?

Edit: 
Thank you all so much for your helpful, positive and encouraging feedback.

2020-11-20 02:23:44,A quote of Obama's Definition of Masculinity,"> Trump, Obama noted, is not exactly an exemplar of traditional American manhood. “I think about the classic male hero in American culture when you and I were growing up: the John Waynes, the Gary Coopers, the Jimmy Stewarts, the Clint Eastwoods, for that matter. There was a code … the code of masculinity that I grew up with that harkens back to the ’30s and ’40s and before that. There’s a notion that a man is true to his word, that he takes responsibility, that he doesn’t complain, that he isn’t a bully—in fact he defends the vulnerable against bullies. And so even if you are someone who is annoyed by wokeness and political correctness and wants men to be men again and is tired about everyone complaining about the patriarchy, I thought that the model wouldn’t be Richie Rich—the complaining, lying, doesn’t-take-responsibility-for-anything type of figure.”

**Almost two-thirds of male patients** said they **avoid going to the doctor as long as possible,** and 37 percent said they understate their condition from their physicians.

I admit, even as a specialist doctor, I too had moments when I underestimated my symptoms of my illness. I put off seeking medical attention as much as possible, convincing myself that small stuff don’t really bother me because **I tend to think: well, they’re nothing and will improve on their own.**

*Wrong.*

There is an omnipresent negative attitude of men towards seeking healthcare. 

Sometimes we fear a bad diagnosis. 

Sometimes it’s a particularly bad case of superhero syndrome.

Sometimes an embarrassing stigma holds us back from fully telling the doc what’s really bothering us.

And man is it difficult to unlearn all that.

But I hope that doesn’t deter us from trying.

Almost all illness in the world will be treated so much quicker and better when it’s detected on the early stage. As always, killing problems before they manifest is really the best, most logical, and most beneficial course of action to take.

Furthermore, believe me that anamnesis (i.e. doctor-patient interview) makes roughly 70-80% of our differential and final diagnosis. That’s how important valuable your recount is. Our physical exam and lab workups are only done more or less to confirm what we hear from you. Therefore an accurate assessment and successful treatment is only possible with full patient cooperation. 

**Men, there is nothing more based than being completely honest about your health concerns.**

Being healthy is the shit. As early as possible, and as much you can, if you got health concerns: **MENtion It!**

2020-11-19 11:34:43,This post on men and crying from the age of sensibility on /r/AskHistorians,"From 
https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7c849p/big_boys_dont_cry_when_became_strong_emotions_in/dpoaqcn 


I had thought that we had previous answers on this topic, but when I looked, they were all bounded to specific periods rather than exploring the change, so you get a fresh new one.

Contrary to the assertions in many of the now-removed comments, masculinity and tears have not always been at odds. I am not prepared to discuss when this began, but in the Middle Ages there was a trope of masculine weeping being a mark of religious devotion and knightly chivalry; by the sixteenth century it was well-established that a masculine man was supposed to have deep emotions and to show them - in some cases, through tears. Masculinity is not inherently constructed as relating primarily to brute strength and stoicism, although it's common for people to think that it is out of presentism (inserting modern values into the past), as well as a view that the past was when ""men were men"" and the modern version of masculinity is therefore a watered-down version of a previous version. 

The early modern British conceptualization of masculinity rested instead upon a range of virtues, from the more obvious strength, bravery, and honorable reputation to honesty, prudence, and self-sufficiency, with interpretations of which were more important differing based on how much patriarchal power and what kind of it different groups of men had. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the virtues of politeness and self-restraint came to the fore. A gentleman was to be courteous to women and other men, to talk problems out, to keep from bursting into loud displays of anger or drunkenness. You might think that that would also put the kibosh on weeping - giving way to feelings of all sorts - but this was not the case. Another gentlemanly trait of the eighteenth century was sensibility, which today sounds like it ought to mean ""rationality"", but is actually being aware of and susceptible to one's finer emotions. This was frequently represented in sentimental novels of the period in ways similar to those you've noted in your question: they weep out of sadness and pity, and sometimes faint when the emotion they feel becomes too much. (That being said, women were generally conceded to have a greater amount of natural sensibility than men on average.) Down the social scale into the middle classes, standards of politeness were more informal and concerns more restricted to physically-restrained conduct, and we have very little idea of what constituted 'masculinity"" in a working-class context.

Tears started to become more strongly feminized in the nineteenth century, and it appears to happen first with boys at school. Through the middle of the century, it was still acceptable for men to weep in their own grief, gratitude, or pity, or, for instance, while watching an emotional scene in a play or melodrama - Dickens once noted that he ""invariably [began] to cry whenever anybody on the stage forgives an enemy or gives away a pocket-book"". It was even laudable, to middle- and upper-class observers, when working-class men showed their humanity by crying at appropriate times. At the same time, an incident of schoolyard bullying in David Copperfield involves one student standing up for another and weeping to some extent as he does so, which results in a caning from a teacher and feminizing mockery from the bully: the student is definitely portrayed as being in the right, and we know that Dickens was a supporter of male tears, but in the context of a Victorian boys' boarding school showing emotion was simply not done. Other narratives of boarding and day schools bear out the same principle of self-restraint in the face of sensibility, with not ""blubbing"" in the face of beating being a point of pride and the people one missed from home being never mentioned except to your closest friends in private, and parenting manuals began to preach that children cried to manipulate and must learn to control themselves and their emotions.

The concept of the ""stiff upper lip"" - originally an Americanism! - started to become a key part of British identity in the 1870s and 1880s, as the children who'd faced this scholastic experience replaced the previous generation of adults and the so-called ""cult of sensibility"" completely died away, to be replaced with stoic self-restraint. Even outside of Britain, obvious tears from men and boys were seen as embarrassing. Men were to be utterly ""rational"" instead of emotional, or, more modernly put, were to value reals over feels. To not do this was to be unmasculine and womanly - and while male effeminacy had been a concern for a long time, this is the period that saw real ""scientific"" attention paid to issues of gender and sexuality, as well as more public discourse on the same, which could lead to serious consequences for the unmasculine man.

2020-11-19 03:23:52,"Thoughts on the ""softboy"" stereotype","**What is a ""softboy""?**

While I have seen some people use it in a more endearing manner, this term is generally used as a pejorative. It is an offshoot of the term ""fuckboy"": it basically refers to a (usually heterosexual) man who - much like a fuckboy - plays with people's emotions, secretly only cares about sex, and generally does nothing but hurt the women in his life. The difference is, the softboy does all of this manipulation and emotional abuse with a veneer of feminine softness - or so the stereotype goes. The implication is basically that, these men embody more androgynous or feminine traits in order to be approachable to women, thus lulling them into a false sense of security where they will be easier to manipulate. Essentially, ""softboys"" are seen as snakes: nothing more than the typical toxic male, with a new coat of paint. A wolf in sheep's clothing.

The superficial qualities of a stereotypic ""softboy"" can include:

* A more sensitive, introverted, soft-spoken, and gentle personality
* Has ""woke"" political opinions, self-identified feminist
* Interest in art, poetry, and hobbies traditionally considered feminine
* Dressing more feminine, wearing makeup, generally embracing a more femme aesthetic
* Might by queer or gender non-conforming
* More submissive in the bedroom / seeking a ""role reversal"" relationship

A note on the latter couple of points: this term doesn't *necessarily* have queer connotations, but I have increasingly seen it used in queer circles, kink and BDSM circles, and ""role reversal"" circles. In these communities it is sometimes used to accuse a man of being a ""poser"" or ""infiltrator"" of sorts - someone who pretends to be feminine or queer or submissive, but has ulterior motives; or one who uses their femininity/queerness/submissiveness as a way to get away with their toxic behaviour. (A lesser-known term used specifically in queer communities, with very similar meaning, is ""tenderqueer."")

&#x200B;

**Interrogating the ""softboy"" stereotype**

To me, the label of ""softboy"" feels like another way that society polices men who deviate from masculine gender expectations. Most people who use this term probably aren't doing this intentionally, but it nonetheless has this effect. Men who embody more ""feminine"" qualities are seen as untrustworthy: there is a suspicion that they are merely performing this aesthetic as a means of preying on women or getting away with toxic behavior. This suggests to me that our society can't comprehend a man deviating from the ""toxic male"" archetype without some level of deception being involved. Its problematic that more androgynous, feminine, or GNC men are met with suspicion and that the authenticity of their gender presentation is always called into question - it feels uncomfortably similar to the distrust our society holds towards gay and bi men, as well as AMAB trans people.

Don't get me wrong. I am NOT suggesting that softer or more feminine men are above criticism, or that they shouldn't be held accountable for their actions. If a so-called ""softboi"" manipulates a significant other, he is an asshole and should be called out as such. But that's exactly it: he's just an asshole. Men of all different walks of life can be jerks! I just question why we need to come up with a specific, separate label for ""guy who is a manipulative jerk"" when the guy in question just so happens to be gender non-conforming in some way. Especially when that label calls into question the authenticity of their identity, or implies that their untrustworthiness is somehow *connected* to their gender expression.

Because the fact is, the aesthetic and gender presentation associated with the ""softboy"" stereotype *is* an authentic lived experience for many men. Speaking from my own experience as a nonbinary person who is generally boyish in my presentation: my androgynous gender presentation, softer personality, and non traditionally masculine interests are not a ""persona"" I am consciously putting on. Its just who I am. And, that fact wouldn't change even if I *were* an asshole who manipulated my significant other! Being a toxic person wouldn't mean my gender identity was a ruse the whole time.

In sum: manipulating women doesn't necessarily mean one's feminine persona is a lie or disguise, and one's feminine persona isn't necessarily a disingenuous guise used to manipulate women. Assuming such is unfair, and reflects poor attitudes towards gender identity & expression.

Men who break gendered social norms face enough stigma as is, so its sad to see a different type of stigma coming from the opposite direction - from within progressive & queer circles.  These are supposed to be spaces for free expressions of gender and selfhood, so seeing certain men's gendered identity called into question or met with suspicion is frustrating. Don't get me wrong, there's not an epidemic of people who feel this way - but its definitely there, and I think it needs addressing.

What is your perspective on the ""softboy""? Is this a useful archetype for describing toxic patterns of behavior, or do you feel it is more harmful than useful?",True,18,0.96,7,,/r/MensLib/comments/jwmegi/thoughts_on_the_softboy_stereotype/,confusedqueeer
2020-11-18 01:03:39,"I've recently committed to restoring my foreskin, and I'm upset at the conversation surrounding circumcision","I will try to keep this conversation less focused on me, but the long and short of it is I finally started the journey to restoring my foreskin, and I'm just finding it a stressful position to be at in my life. 


Apart from it being a deeply personal journey to go on that obviously can't be shared with really anyone in my personal circle, I'm reminded of the times I've discussed circumcision with others and it's just... frustrating, seemingly no matter who I've spoken to about it.


Other men (or at least, redditors) seem to largely be apathetic to the conversation. The most common response is how they are so *happy* to be circumcised. And I don't want to be against that - from what I can gather, circumcision affects men differently and poses little issue for many men. If they enjoy that aspect of their genitalia, then I'm willing to accept that. But it doesn't affect all men the same, and I feel like it's affected me negatively - and it's exhausting trying to convince someone that people should simply be given the choice on what they want to do with their own body. 



My previous girlfriend was an ardent feminist and despite my respect for her views, I'm never bringing up circumcision to her again. Every conversation we had where I managed to bring it up and hint that I was disappointed with my own and felt cheated out of a choice I have a definite preference on, she moved the topic of conversation to bodily autonomy issues women faced instead. It was clear from our conversations that while she thought men should be given a choice in the matter, there were more pertinent problems at hand and the ""successful"" outcome of many circumcisions didn't warrant much outrage. I'm glad I'm out of that relationship but the lack of understanding and empathy combined with the dismissive attitude towards men speaking out against circumcision really broke my trust in someone who claimed to be for equality. 


And lastly, those restoring their foreskins well are - at times - another source of negative conversations. Simply because these are often filled with sadness and grief. Restoring, as it currently stands, won't ever fully replace the original foreskin. There are certain structures and nerve endings that simply won't make a return - there's never a way to feel 100% whole. This is something I'm not prepared to face head on in the coming months - as much as my journey will lead me where I want to be, I'll still never be able to fully rectify the choices others have made, and that's painful.



I really don't know where this post was going. I'm just frustrated. This is a topic I feel like I can't discuss anymore lest I be laughed out of the room or dismissed for being oversensitive. I don't think I'll bring up to anyone close to me - let alone my therapist. I'm hoping someday in the future it can be discussed more freely, or at least with less judgment among men, but until then I'll just be here, quietly trying to look how I want to look.



Edit: this is reposted due to some issues with the subreddit rules.


Also, to answer a question from a user - the most common method of foreskin restoration involves placing tension on the foreskin in order to encourage skin growth. Over time (were talking months to years), the skin will lengthen and eventually be able to cover the glans. Surgery is another option but involves obvious complications from skin grafting and the delicate operation.


Edit 2: I do want to say after reading another comment that I don't want to advocate for restoration. It's a very personal decision and does carry non-zero risks of damage. It is certainly worth considering discussing with a professional (medical or mental health) if this is something worth pursuing or if there are other avenues for accepting one's body that may be worth trying.",True,1665,0.95,469,,/r/MensLib/comments/jvwotg/ive_recently_committed_to_restoring_my_foreskin/,girlytransthrowaway

I certainly have been guilty of gifting my father too many ties in a row, but in my defence this was at a time when people at least still wore ties to work!

The classic “man presents” seem to exemplify a narrow, outdated view of manhood: Men are seen as workers (socks, ties), repairmen (tools), drinkers/smokers (whiskey and cigars), and rugged DIY outdoorsmen (more tools, beard care, leather stuff). I’m not saying you’re not allowed to want and like those things, I’m saying maybe there should be more diversity in presents for men.

It’s such a cliché that men, and especially fathers, are hard to buy presents for. Do men not have wishes, dreams, hobbies? Receiving a boring or generic present makes it feel like the gift giver doesn’t really know you or hasn’t really taken the time to think about what you might enjoy beyond ""being a man"".

So let’s make a better Christmas Gift Guide *For Him* together:

I’m wondering if there’s any other good resources you folks can recommend for parenting; books, movies, articles, podcasts, whatever!

I always felt like I had a good childhood and a good relationship with my father, but once I became an adult and especially once I entered a long term relationship I realized I was sorely lacking in all kinds of ways. I was emotionally stunted, thought I was “easygoing” but really was a doormat, and I had an incredibly self-centred outlook on life. I don’t think I’ve ever told my dad I loved him, nor him me. We get along fine, but I would hardly say we are good friends. We share almost no interests apart from very superficial ones.

We were discussing our hardships in dating men, and one thing we had in common was having experienced at some point being overly sexualized. When I brought up how I have never experienced these things when dating women, both of them straight out said that ""men can't help themselves, while women can"". They argued that there are biological differences that makes it very hard for men to control their urges, and that this is why some men treat them badly. One of them said that since she was young her grandmother would tell her that men only think with their dicks, and that that's just how they are. 

Now, I am not cis, so I can't speak for cis men. But I have an above average testosterone level according to my doctor, and my sex drive is off the charts.

So unless there is some secret dick curse I haven't heard about that makes people with dicks unable to control themselves, I'm going to go ahead and call bullshit on that statement.

I argued that just because someone has a high desire for sex, it does not impair their ability to not be an asshole, and that the behavior they're describing is a choice on the other person's end. And that their excusing of such behavior is what's enabling it. If women think it's okay for men to treat them badly, then there will always be some men who continue to do so.

I'm 18 and whenever I've had a day/week/month where my mental health or emotional state goes to shit, I just sit down and it all pours onto the page. 

It's not for everyone but I found it's a really healthy way to express and explore my emotions.

It was also great for me because I was never particularly aggressive and, when those emotions did hit, I didn't know how to process them. I still can't really process aggression well. Autism is fun.

Writing helped me overcome so much and helped me understand so much about myself and those around me. It's amazing how fulfilling it can make you feel.

So, with all that rambling out of the way, I ask you all, what was your outlet? 

Was it more physically active or even violent? 

Or was it something more subtle and/or chill?

2020-11-16 05:52:30,"An overview of gender stereotypes in pop culture, based on data from TVtropes","You probably heard of TVtropes, a large wiki that intends to list every single ""trope"" in entertainment media.   Each trope has its own page listing hundreds of examples, so it should be possible to estimate the frequency of each trope just by counting the examples. Using the [Gender Dynamic Index](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderDynamicsIndex), a portal of all tropes related to gender, I calculated the frequency of various gender stereotypes in pop culture, including films, comics, manga, books, video games etc.

The goal is to get a quantitative sense of how common these stereotypes are, to know which ones are very frequent and which ones are just anecdotal. I also extracted the release date of the examples, to see how gender stereotypes in the media evolved with time.

I figured you might find it interesting, so let's dive into the data!

Here are the top 50 most common tropes on women:

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank\_women-1344x1536.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank_women-1344x1536.png)

And on men:

TVtropes also has a category for tropes that contrast men and women:

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank\_contrast-1536x768.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank_contrast-1536x768.png)

Here is a breakdown by medium for some common tropes, revealing substantial variation:

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/By-medium-1536x1536.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/By-medium-1536x1536.png)

If you would like to see the same plot for any given trope that I did not include, don't hesitate to ask (it's very easy for me to generate new plots).

I also plotted the frequency of various tropes by date. Here are a few selected examples:

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Evolution-1536x768.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Evolution-1536x768.png)

Again, I can easily make new plots for other tropes if you are wondering about something in particular.

Here is a larger plot, showing how each trope has changed in frequency between the pre-2000 and the post-2000 eras.

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Change-since-2000-1536x1536.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Change-since-2000-1536x1536.png)

Lots of things are just what you would expect. Here are a some observations that struck me:

\* ""Drowning my sorrows"" is the second trope about men with most examples on TVtropes. It's about male characters getting drunk when they are sad. I did not expect this to be that high (the only trope that is more frequent is ""Rated M for Manly"", that is, manly characters). And it does not seem to decrease over time. Maybe that's an issue that deserves some attention.

\* ""Damsel in Distress"" had a big peak in the 1990s, but it is getting less common. I suppose this is due to video games, which no longer rely on the damsel-in-distress scenario as much as they used to.

\* ""Men are the Expandable Gender"": this one has become more and more frequent since the mid-80s. There does not seem to be a lot of effort from writers to avoid this trope. Maybe that will change in the future?

\* In the last plot, you can see some cultural change over the last decades: ""Evil Cripple"", ""Cigarette of Anxiety"", ""Good Girls Avoid Abortion"" all became less common since 2000.

\* There are a few ""corrective tropes"", that are inversions of classic stereotypes, for example female characters taking active roles. Most of them increased in frequency after 2000, as you'd expect. However, some ""empowering"" tropes (""Damsel out of Distress"", ""Rebellious Princess"") have become \*less\* common since 2000. On the other hand, not-so-positive tropes like ""Female Gaze"" are becoming much more common.

2020-11-14 00:34:51,"As a man, I cry in front of people whenever I feel like it. It's refreshing","I was fired yesterday and cried in front of my ex-boss.

If I feel like crying (i.e. when I'm suffering) I bloody well will do so.

Crying is a natural defense mechanism against suffering. Denying men the ability to cry in front of people, in this day and age, just completely obliterates their ability to process their emotions. I have a theory that if we don't cry, we then must put that bad energy elsewhere, like into aggression and latent resentment, which will inevitably hurt others.

There are two ways to cry:

* You can cry involuntarily, which leads to looking like you're constantly holding it back, ashamed and hyper-aware of what everyone thinks of the crying, which will just make things even more awkward
* You can cry completely unashamedly, showing that you do not care on a meta-level what anyone thinks of your crying or how you look.

This isn't to advocate crying at spilt milk, or at every damn thing. But if your girlfriend breaks up with you, feel free to damn well cry in front of her. If you accidentally chop off your finger, feel free to cry out in pain and shed a freaking tear. If something makes you upset, do not hide that emotion. It isn't weakness. I'm amazed at the number of people in the world who think crying = undue helplessness or weakness. It is a RESPONSE. If anything it is the thing that signals the beginning of the fix to the problem.

Cry strongly, and completely, without a care of what others think of your tears. It will make you stronger.",True,2103,0.98,128,,/r/MensLib/comments/jtiyfq/as_a_man_i_cry_in_front_of_people_whenever_i_feel/,Hour_Status
2020-11-13 19:29:16,Sex negativity is not the answer to male liberation,"This is a warranted topic I think, because I see many people slipping into this. I spot it in progressive circles, in toxic MRA camps, all over really. 

It can be about people engaging in valid consent discussion but then suddenly slip into treating every sexual encounter between two people as something deadly serious on all counts, go from there to wanting to distance themselves from very normal desires and make the ""moral"" decision to withdraw from it all. 

Meanwhile, in women hating groups, repressing desire serves another function of course. To fully disengage from all women. Straight sex obviously needs to go, so framing it into something repulsive until you start believing it seems to be their ticket. 

There's also the nofappers. I haven't really detected misogyny there and to be fair, compulsive and addictive behaviors can sometimes be successfully addressed with a firm cold turkey approach, but they breed paranoia among men (mostly men) who actually aren't addictive in this regard, and had been better off not listening in.

What I think is that sex positivity, heavily communicated throughout the latter half of the last century had some blind spots that caused a lot of damage, but for the most part they were right. In their fever of fighting culturally and religiously induced shame, they by accident left several questions open. They didn't go far enough in stressing how ""bad circumstance sex"" in all forms can really damage the psyche, even when there's no violations involved. They made all young people who didn't have someone to sleep with feel utterly abnormal by giving them no mention whatsoever. Sure, there was a lot of talk about masturbation being a healthy and fun practice, but they didn't draw the connection fully that the sexual and amorous relationship with the self is the real primary.

That last part I think is the missing piece. What's most important is a good relationship with the self, and that includes to be able to see yourself as attractive, lovable, hot, in your own way, and for yourself. To nurture that on your own. From that point, if somebody else sees the same in you, and you them great, you two might have something, but it's not the primary thing. 

So you don't need to get laid to become a full person in this regard, but at the same time you don't have to go and become an anti-sex demagogue either to gain peace of mind. 

I'm not handwaving unwanted loneliness aso. but I think it'd help a lot of suffering men to gain perspective. Sex positivity needs to be improved upon and relaunched, maybe?",True,761,0.97,224,,/r/MensLib/comments/jtff3e/sex_negativity_is_not_the_answer_to_male/,RimbaudsRevenge
2020-11-14 07:29:06,What men's issues concerns do you have under a Biden administration?,"I sort of doubt that there are many people here who are upset that Trump has likely lost his reelection bid, but that said, I have some personal concerns about the state of men's issues under Biden's presidency, and I'm curious to see what the community thinks.

By way of getting the conversation started, here are two off the dome:

+ The Opioid Crisis: The opioid epidemic [massively disproportionately affects men](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/opioid-overdose-deaths-by-gender/), and given Biden's opposition to even moderate drug reforms like decriminalizing marijuana on the federal level, his glad acceptance of huge donations from the pharmaceutical lobby, and his general pro-law-enforcement history and platform, I have serious concerns about making much progress on this issue under his watch.

+ Austerity, Generally: Biden's transition team has already been sending manifest signals that his administration will be attempting to ""rein in federal spending"" to address ""the deficit,"" and to ""work across the aisle,"" and other such political doublespeak. This can be read as a return to a neoliberal economic approach where social services/community block grants/direct financial support will be curtailed, if not entirely done away with, to say nothing of an Obama-era-style total capitulation to the GOP on nearly every social issue. I am not optimistic about how, for instance, the male homelessness or suicide crises will be affected by this approach.

I find it rather offensive,  on multiple levels.   Not the least that any woman feels entitled to touch me and that I should be overjoyed for the attention,  but there's a certain Pavlovian undertone to the statement.   The ""sex bell"" is rung, like a mindless dog,  I'm supposed to come running.

Maybe this is a similar conversation to the one where, in patriarchal society, men always want sex.   But the implicit idea here seems to be that men *only* want sex,  and that sex is all that needs to be presented to keep a guy ""running back for more. ""

Given the prevalence of the ""hit it and quit"" mentality among many men (not my style,  but I'm pretty much celibate by choice or by standards),  I'm guessing that this actually isn't true for many men.   Sex alone isn't enough.

2020-11-10 23:51:14,"What my life as a trans woman has taught me about male sexuality and ""bottom shame""","I've been a lurker on this subreddit for a really long time and have admired it for a while! But being a trans woman, I have been wary of getting involved in men's spaces in any way, even one as trans positive as this one, for fear of being misgendered or misunderstood. But this morning I went on a deep dive into discussion posts about male sexuality and socialization here and it really made so many parts of my life & sexuality click that I wanted to share with you all.

Understandably, most of the posts about transness here are from trans men, but I think transfemininity also has an immense amount of unrecognized potential for understanding the experiences of how boys and men are raised. In the same way that transmasculine perspectives broaden the universe of what we can understand to be men's experiences of their own bodies, living as a trans woman has allowed me to diagnose why I always hated my ""male"" body and ""male"" sexuality in my adolescence and younger adulthood.

I want to be clear and avoid any misconceptions here: I do not speak for all trans women. While viewing my childhood as a boyhood has been generative, many trans women do not identify with boyhood at all. Trans women all have a unique and individualized relationship with their past, and it is crucial to not generalize the experiences of any one trans woman to others. Speaking for myself, I am a woman in every sense of the word, **and also** I was raised in a boy's body. Whenever people or media talked about men's bodies or genitalia, I internalized that to mean something about me.

So much of my journey as a trans woman has been spent trying to untether my body and my sexuality from a reflexive self-disgust that I internalized from so many sources & communities, even the most body-positive feminist ones. Back in college, when I believed I was a just a very feminine man, I had a really difficult time navigating some of the casually harmful language even my most leftist friends would use for bigoted men: ""he's probably compensating for a small dick"" or ""maybe if he were less ugly..."".

There was a sense in which, if a man was a harmful person, then their body was fair game to insult. Some of this was understandable. Many of the cis women friends I had who would talk about how they couldn't trust anyone with a dick were also survivors of sexual assault. Some genuinely believed that anyone with a dick was just biologically kind of dangerous. That didn't prevent them from forming close friendships with men and believing in the possibility of healthy masculinity. But there was a laziness with which they linked toxic masculinity to AMAB biology. While they were not TERFs, some of what they said aligns with TERF philosophies about how trans women are fated to be as predatory as cis men because of our dicks & our ""biologies"".

I think such rhetoric was partially responsible for my internalized transphobia around my own genitalia. I was so jealous of the ways my friends (most of whom were cis women) could talk about their bodies and genitalia in an empowering way, how discussing masturbation could be a beautiful, feminist conversation for them. Though nobody said so directly, I felt like no discussion about my body or my dick could ever be appropriate or anything less than disgusting.

I felt like my sexual desire, though quite strictly vanilla (apart from fantasizing about having my hand held during sex), was just doomed to be dangerous. In my mind, my friends' beliefs were justified by their experiences, and it was not my place to dispute them. Certainly, I was able to find ample proof just by noting the sheer amount of r\*pists and predatory men on campus. And the few feminist men who I was friends with had such similar experiences of feeling their sexuality stigmatized that they were not comfortable talking about their intimate and private feelings around sex and their dicks. Such conversations would have been wonderful, and finding them here has been a breath of fresh air, even if they're more relevant for who I used to be.

While I managed to grow out of these feelings once I had lived for a while as a trans woman and had the opportunity to explore my sexuality beyond such binaries, I still have a lot of ""bottom shame"". Even being a conventionally pretty and passing woman, I still have so much trouble feeling sexy or worthy of attraction because of my dick. On the other hand, I've reached the part of my life where I know, fundamentally, that I am a beautiful woman, and every part of me is worthy of love and celebration (that said, **chasers fuck off**). Learning to finally offer my body the kindness and care that I wish others had has transformed my life, in and out of the bedroom.

The reason I'm posting these experiences here is because I think there's so much commonality between what trans women call ""bottom shame"" and what men quietly experience and internalize about their own ""bottoms"". I think that, among many other things, the lack of kind, healthy, and empowering discussions on *how men want, and how men want to be wanted,* combined with noxious socialization that demands that men *want* in harmful ways, has created a culture where men feel there is no alternative to predatory sexuality. One that says men can only be *subjects* of desire, and that the only way anyone will want to fuck them is if they are coerced to. That is not to excuse predatory behaviors. Many, many men cope with self-hatred and internalized disgust without assaulting and harming others.

But as someone who has experienced the joy and liberation of untethering my body from what it is expected to be, and has seen how sex & sexuality has been a source of empowerment for so many of cis and trans sisters, I want nothing more than for my brothers and siblings to be able to love themselves too. I believe a world where men are encouraged to explore pleasure and love their own bodies is one where I no longer have to assume that every one of my sisters is a survivor. I believe a world where men can experiment with toys without stigma and cry to one another about their bodily & sexual insecurities is one where a girl like me would not have to go through years of internalized disgust before arriving at self-love. Browsing this sub and seeing the conversations you all have with one another makes that world feel possible.

We joke that we keep our love for each other in our belly fat just to take away the self conscious thoughts. One day we got a leaflet from a chain shopping center with ads and while looking through this picture really caught my attention. It made me happy! I showed it to my fiance too and he was happy too. I often see how Internet is celebrating that female underwear, swimsuit or other clothing industries use female models of different body types or use a minimal amount of editing. However,  I cannot recall seeing such celebration or even rising a problem that male models used in many ads lack body diversity as well and that it effects male self esteem too. My fiance introduced me to this subreddit recently and I wanted to contribute and support it as well. 

How ads in your country manage male body positivity and diversity? How do they make you feel?",True,136,0.95,20,,/r/MensLib/comments/jqeffn/male_body_positivity_in_finland/,rapyra_nefere
2020-11-08 04:08:35,Examining bias in how we view trans men and women,"I recently responded to a comment in a post inquiring about the insight trans men and women have gained through their experiences in transitioning. I have been reflecting on my perception of trans men and women lately, and it occurred to me this would be a good post topic. I have decided to simply leave below the comment I made in the post referenced. If anyone would like to share experiences or personal insight, please do!

“I really appreciate your last point, and it is something I have been pondering more so as of late. I recently saw someone who said something similar in a comment section, and it got me thinking - how do I perceive trans men and women? Do I have unconscious bias that causes me to subconsciously differentiate trans men from cis men, or trans women from cis women? I came to the realization that on some level, yes, I did.
So then, what is causing me to view trans men and women as such? Well, framing is what constitutes the manifestation of our perspective, so let’s examine how this is framed in my mind. First, we must understand that framing is relative to our experiences and knowledge base. I now see that I have not done the research and thinking necessary to develop a complex, well rounded understanding of the relationship (and differentiation) between biological sex at birth and gender identity. My perspective, lacking in understanding and fluidity, has therefore been more rudimentary than I would like to admit, but that I must admit in order to develop my understanding and subsequently my perspective - to grow as a person, and grow my compassion, empathy, and understanding of those around me.
Everyone has bias, and that is okay. That is human. Measure of intelligence and character is in one’s ability and willingness to shift opinion and perspective in the face of, and according to new information that we are presented. Growth and change cannot be divorced.”

In finishing thoughts, I would like to encourage everyone to listen - really listen to our trans brothers and sisters, absorb and reflect on their experience and insight. There is a myriad of life lessons which we can draw from these experiences which lend applicable to our worldly understanding in every walk of life.

**Edit to add**: I am not saying there are no differences between the experience of trans and cis men, or that we don’t have individual and unique experiences. I am saying that we should examine and challenge the arbitrary boundaries that we subconsciously draw according to societal gender construct. In other words, the male experience is inclusive to both cis and trans men, and the differences in our individual experiences should be embraced with compassion and understanding. I hope that clears this up

2020-11-08 14:10:51,Beyond binary identities (politics) through class-based policies,"I've been thinking about this for some time now to reconcile how financially and otherwise privileged people are benefitting due to policies intended to help a marginalised group.

Various forms of affirmative action and quotas are in placed to help oppressed groups such as ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ+, non-binary etc. and likely more groups in the future as our awareness increases.

However, oppression and disadvantages don't appear to be equally spread in a group. Some individuals are better off due to other forms of privilege that we don't acknowledge, such as:

* IQ/intelligence.
* Attractiveness.
* Absense of disabilities, hereditary illnesses etc.
* A stable upbringing in a healthy family as opposed to a history of trauma/abuse.
* Born into a powerful network/community, e.g. a metropolitan city vs a rural town with poor facilities, safe neighbourhood, industrial/innovation hub.
* And I could go on, I don't think we will be able to recognised every privilege vs disadvantage an individual experiences.

As a straight man but an ethnic minority myself I have many similar friends that are succeeding at higher-education and life in general. It would seem unethical if some of us benefit from identity-based policies whilst other don't, because we marginalise their class as they are part of a privileged group (straight men).

I believe we should attempt to help all people regardless of their age, race/ethnicity, gender and other qualifiers. What do you think of class-based policies that would be fairer towards all people by taking into consideration:

* Means-testing: Don't reinforce benefits if someone already has vast wealth/assets and has escaped certain forms of marginalisation.
* Support people with trauma/abuse, mental health issues and hereditary illnesses that affect performance, such as autism, down syndrome etc.
* Opportunities available for upward mobility: educated parents, wealthy relatives that support each other (?).

I found this article online that is also thinking along these lines. I believe the current polarisation and cultural grid-lock could be eased through this approach: [https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/04/affirmative-action-should-be-based-on-class-not-race](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/04/affirmative-action-should-be-based-on-class-not-race)

We have yet to legally fully acknowledge gender fluid people - many existing policies discriminate against them because they have to fit into a gender-binary. I believe this will require a radical rethinking of our policies. What is your opinion about this?

EDIT: I should've mentioned I'm in Australia and not the US. Some of you think I'm talking about healthcare, which here is mostly free and in my opinion a basic human right. I was thinking mostly about work/education and other equity programs where existing affirmative action can be tweaked without radical overhaul in the short-term.",True,41,0.84,29,,/r/MensLib/comments/jq6uoo/beyond_binary_identities_politics_through/,ThatGuyWeLike87

I literally only found out about it like 3 years ago, and only this year found out about prostate orgasms, which is weird because it seems like there's a lot of hidden potential there, it's like half a male's sexuality. It seems like it's not discussed much (probably because some people toxically think it's gay)


I'd heard of prostate cancer and exams and things, but never in any kind of even basic detail. Which is terrible considering it serves a reproductive purpose!

Sex education for boys and girls really needs to be better.

Anyone else have a similar story or anything?

2020-11-03 20:05:39,How to deal with insecurities and these “competitions” between us?,"Not long ago, a friend told me about how he felt he shouldn’t try to be with a girl he likes because he isn’t “as good” as other guys that want to be with her. For example: even though he is smart for a lot of things he doesn’t do well in school/university and that stuff yet he knows what he talks about.

I know these guys he talks about and they have insecurities as well, I think we all have them.  But the worst part is that we live in this constant “competition” between us that do nothing but aggravate said insecurities. This feeling that we have to beat others in order to be the “superior”, even in things we don’t like and don’t actually care. Up to the point that sometimes people question you as a man.

Don’t let anybody question who you are and say you are less for not doing or liking this or other thing. Do the things you love, the most beautiful thing anyone could be is passionate about what they do.


Challenge yourselves but not because others are better than you at something but because you want to be better than yourself yesterday.

2. The example in this post is just an example and not the main point. I wanted to talk about the pressure sometimes we put on ourselves or others and how that affects them. 

Yes, for more secure people is crazy how someone could think something like this but it does happen.

And when I vent to my leftist friends, they tell me that they're scared too, but we can fight it.  But what if I don't have the spoons to fight alongside them?

I recently deleted the app I was using to look at porn as I was no longer comfortable the increasing time I was spending on it, as well as the content itself getting more extreme. I've also always been interested in kink and have explored it with my (female) partner since before my transition, but it felt very different now that I identify as male because before there wasn't any actual societal power differential between us in the way that there is between men and women. I feel like I'm having difficulty navigating these things as a guy - I know biological changes are likely going to keep my sex drive higher than I've been used to in the past, but I'm not sure exactly where the line is when my increased masturbation and porn usage is unhealthy, or how to navigate sexuality with my partner in a new social role. 

So, some questions for people with more experience with male sexuality than me: 

1) What do you define as a healthy or ideal relationship with masturbation and/or porn? 

2) Do you feel that, if you are not monitoring your relationship with masturbation and/or porn, it becomes unhealthy? Does this happen in connection with other issues in your life (mental health, motivation, etc.) or is it mostly independent of them?

3) For others interested in kink, how do you navigate ensuring that you're not perpetuating gendered social roles? (This one is probably most applicable to people who are attracted to women and lean more dominant, but I'm open to hearing everyone's experiences on kink + gender)

2020-11-01 15:57:00,Struggling with intrusive anti-woman/incel-ish thoughts post breakups,"Forgive me if this is better suited to r/relationshipadvice but I found that sub a nightmare of bad advice, insecurities, and gendered biases. I'll try and keep this conversation more about cishet men's experience in general (though gender/sexuality diverse thoughts are totally welcome), but I may also talk about this for a Tuesday or Friday thread.

Had a long distance relationship end this week, partly due to contrasting status of the coronavirus restrictions and state of the epidemic where we each live, and partly due to us unable to see each other for several months due to border shutdowns. I was very saddened by the loss of the relationship as it felt quite devoted and we had made plans to move in together once borders had been opened. I think however it was the situation improving that may have created anxieties in her about the move (caused some for me also), and I guess her feelings towards me changed. We spoke for a long time but were unable to find any other recourse but to end things.

On some level, we had a fairly mature conversation about our feelings and concerns in the relationship, but the desire to break-up was not mutual. Therefore I felt myself developing judgements of her - considering her selfish, immature, like she was giving up, etc. - which quickly fed my anxieties about my own self-worth. Could it really be just the lockdown that caused it, or was there something wrong with me? Am I somehow inadequate?

These feelings can sometimes cause me to draw comparisons and similarities between past relationships and make generalisations in my head about the behavior of women. This is not helped by the non-Anglo European family environment I have grown up in which is highly suspicious of women's agency in relationships, and their capacity to be 'manipulative' of men. Of course, the contemporary slant on this cultural discrimination against women has an extremely vitriolic side in the 'incel' (which I think is a self-contradictory term) movement. Whilst I was never a true 'incel' (largely because I was never *that* racist or sexist), I do feel prone to thinking adjacent hateful generalisations about women. These thoughts can be intrusive, and mixed with depression, can be disabling. I do attend therapy and have some outlets for this, but I do also have an isolated professional life and few social circles.

My question to the sub is: Have people here been previous adherents to that kind of broad women-hating ideology and departed from that thinking?  Do they re-emerge in difficult personal moments? How do you manage to cope with these thought patterns? I see it akin to a now-atheist former Christian having fears of Hell late at night.

P.S. I want to make it clear that politically I am totally in favour of the emancipation and liberation of women, and the liberation of men from toxic gender norms and, frankly, gender altogether.

P.S.S. I'm no doubt also aware that I'm in a raw stage of post-relationship grieving and likely some of this is near-universal. I just would like the conversation to see how we can combat these unhealthy and destructive ideologies. I also have friends whom at once brag about sexual conquests, and in 'dry spells', fall victim to summary judgements about women's sexuality and behaviour in relationships.

2020-11-02 05:49:22,Toxic Masculinity is a Cult,"Everything becomes so much clearer when we reframe the discussion as such. Why there are so many young boys, young men, adult men, old men (and some girls and women) who engage in what we would term ""toxic masculinity""—a mode of behaviour that is sometimes violent, inherently unhealthy and destructive to others and ourselves. 

It makes sense why I can remember other boys my age (when I was 6) already behaving cruelly, reproducing the same sexism they witnessed from the world around them. And why a decade later, when they encounter ideas challenging the things they'd been taught to embody (sexism, misogyny, internalised misandry, patriarchy, objectification, and so on), some men, young and old, would vehemently (almost instinctively) reject that confrontation outright. 

It's a cult. No wonder our world is as it is, when young children—especially young boys—are *indoctrinated* by a sophisticated cultural force to believe:

* that boys are different than girls.
* that boys eventually like girls, and they're expected to. (enforcing heteronormativity)
* that a boy's **worth**, his *cool-ness*, his success and even desirability, is derived from his relationship status.
* that girls and women are to be 'possessed' as life partners and sexual objects. 
* that romance is a conquest.
* that to 'get' a girlfriend or wife, boys have to *prove* themselves: *fight* for it, fight for her.
* that failing to achieve romance (and attaining a romantic partner) means a personal fault, a failure to meet **everyone's** expectations.
* that empathy, sympathy and sadness are weaknesses.
* that vulnerability is not appropriate, but violence is.
* that domination is strength.
* that strength is everything that makes someone a **man.**
* that masculinity has to be achieved, performed, and not something inherent in all boys and all men.
* that their ""Man-card"" can be invalidated and rescinded, if they cross an arbitrary line.
* that deviating from all these doctrines makes them an *un*man: a woman, a girl, a sissy: which also mean they're worthless, deviants, pariahs.

All this is absorbed, beginning at our formative, most-vulnerable years. All of us are victims and (I hope) survivors of this insidious cult. Yet many men remain gripped by toxic masculinity, defined by it, for years and years. No matter the constraints it puts on their lives, they defend it, propagate it. Because like an abusive partner, toxic masculinity also provides us a framework to feel valued—while simultaneously condemning any alternative we could seek. 

This is a lot to deal with. It's unfair to anyone.

So I want to take this chance to reaffirm to you, reading this: 

# You are worthwhile. You have nothing to prove. You deserve to feel loved.

I suppose this is more geared toward binary trans men who choose to medically transition, but I think nonbinary perspectives are just as valuable!
I think trans manhood is important, under-discussed, and a valuable/valid manhood.

1. What insights into masculinity have you gained after transitioning?
2. To what extent do male hormones affect your personality and experience of the world?
3. What surprised you about being perceived as male/moving in spaces as a man?
4. What is a question about your experience you wish someone would ask you, and what is your answer to it?

2020-11-01 02:33:37,Obama Expanding the Definition of Masculinity,"I flipped on the TV this afternoon to see Obama stumping for Joe Biden. I missed much of the speech but there was a part of the speech I did catch which really caught my attention. Obama began discussing Trump’s performative masculinity. Someone will probably be able to clip this out at some point, and I can’t quote it, but he noted how Trump brags and has bravado but lacks what Obama said men “used to be.” Caring, hard working, supportive of their families and communities, who look out for others. The centrality of care in his definition of masculinity was striking. I don’t think I’ve heard this from him before or from anyone of such prominence before honestly. I doubt a speech for Joe Biden will radically influence America’s idea of masculinity, but it was heart warming to see.",True,572,0.93,75,,/r/MensLib/comments/jlnj5t/obama_expanding_the_definition_of_masculinity/,MyFianceMadeMeJoin
2020-11-01 03:23:22,We can't have Positive Masculinity without Affirming Masculinity.,"I've noticed that I've really hyper focused on questions about male sexuality for some time now. After this, I'll try to maybe tone it down a bit and try to think about other things, because it clearly have affected my ability to really look at certain issues in a broader scope. My last thread, about creating Menslib dating advice, got locked for a good reason. It where too broad and had been brought up a LOT of times on this Sub. After giving it some thought, my goal of that thread where to point out certain aspects of the discussion around positive masculinity that could be applied to things outside of dating and sex. 

I'll try to explain myself in as neutral of language possible. Basically, one aspect of positive masculinity, is to stop shaming and pressuring men to try to live up to societal toxic expectations. We want men to express and celebrate their own masculinity, without shame, I have NO problem with this and it's great. What I do have a problem with is that we don't question what boundaries these toxic expectations set up around what type of men can occupy and how well certain needs can be met. 

Basically, society have implied that there's repercussions for being ""unmanly"". While we rightly point out that calling men ""unmanly"", in a derogatory way, is toxic and harmful, we don't challenge the idea of the repercussions, being seen as such might bring. Sometimes, it feels like we just try to find a way for us to change our attitudes **about** them, instead of tackling them head on. I think that this can be a very big hurdle for people to actually want to join us. 

What I would want to see more of, is Affirming Masculinity. I don't know if affirming is the right word, but my thesaurus tells me that it is. What I would love to see is us being comfortable saying that you can find a way to love yourself for who you are, no matter the flavor of masculinity and not feel like that flavor sorts you into a specific ""caste"" of male. 

Ehh, I hope you guys understand what I mean whit all of this. This is something that has been on my mind for a while and I feel like my main point came through.

2020-10-31 02:01:58,Call them what they are: the Hunter Biden leaks are revenge porn.,"Recently you might have heard talk about videos or photos being passed around the internet featuring Hunter Biden, the son of 
US Presidential candidate Joe Biden. These photos and videos show someone who is claimed to be Hunter Biden engaging in sexual
activity. Due to the timing of these leaks, it's clear they were intended to damage the reputation of Hunter Biden and his father's
campaign. Unfortunately, I haven't seen too many people call these leaks what they actually are: Revenge Porn. From FindLaw.com, a common
definition of revenge porn is this:

> Intentional distribution of non-consensual porn, or ""revenge porn,"" is a type of online harassment that occurs when an ex-partner or even a hacker posts sexually explicit images of a person online without their permission.

> But what exactly is revenge porn? Does it mean that someone wants revenge on another person and posts pornographic material containing them? Not quite. In fact, in many jurisdictions a perpetrator doesn't even need to be exacting revenge on anyone. The distributor of the material need only intend to distribute the sexually explicit video or photograph with the intent to annoy or harass the victim without their consent.

For revenge porn laws by state, please visit: [State Revenge Porn Laws](https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/revenge-porn-laws-by-state.html)

We need to treat these leaks like any other revenge porn leaks: Don't share them, don't look at them, don't sexualize them, and call people out who do these things. 
Hunter Biden did not consent to these images being shared online, and like all victims of revenge porn, we should note and respect his non-consent.",True,6534,0.9,435,moderator,/r/MensLib/comments/jl1t6u/call_them_what_they_are_the_hunter_biden_leaks/,anhedonious_rex

2020-10-31 05:18:17,Quotes From Male Victims of Domestic Assault,"To preface this post, I'm trying to provide more awareness for male victims of domestic violence and how they are treated, in general, when they seek help.

It's a bit of a touchy subject and not often talked about and I think the only way to spur change is to be open to the experiences and conversations of men who have endured this.

I'm also spreading awareness on my Instagram (male\_liberation).

 All the quotes come from this [article.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/#!po=7.35294)

**Experience with DV help resources**

 *“They didn’t really listen to what I said. They* ***assumed that all abusers are men and said that I must accept that I was the abuser****. They ridiculed me for not leaving my wife,* ***ignoring the issues about what I would need to do to protect my 6 children*** *and care for them.” (Experience with a DV agency)* 

 *“\[T\]hey offered to listen if I wanted to recount what had happened \[sic\], but indicated that* ***no support services were available.****” (Experience with DV hotline)* 

 *“I was mostly just doing research after the occurrence \[sic\] to find out what I should do. I found mostly* ***female help sites and was turned down by several so I gave up****.” (Experience using online resources)* 

&#x200B;

**Experiences with Police**

 *“They determined she was the aggressor but said* ***since I was a man it was silly to arrest her****.”* 

 *“Told me to get her help.* ***Told me to spend the night in a hotel.****”* 

 *“****They saw me \[sic\] as a large male and…took her side****. I was at the* ***hospital with bruising and burned eyes from hot coffee thrown in them****. They didn’t believe that she did this…and* ***refused to arrest her****… The next incident…the police…****saw me bleeding they charged her with felony DV but later dropped it to misdemeanor assault because we are not married and do not live together.****”* 

&#x200B;

**General Statistics on the Experience of Male Victim who seek Help (from the Results section)**

***""****A large proportion of those who sought help from DV agencies (49.9%), DV hotlines (63.9%), or online resources (42.9%) were told,* ***“We only help women.”***

*""further, 95.3% of those men (n=81) said that they were given the impression that the* ***agency was biased against men****.""* 

*""Over 25% of those using an online resource reported that they were given a phone number for help which* ***turned out to be the number for a batterer’s program.****""*

*""The results from the open-ended questions showed that 16.4% of the men who contacted a hotline reported that the* ***staff made fun them****, as did 15.2% of the men who contacted local DV agencies.""*

*""In 54.9% of cases, the* ***partner was determined to be the primary aggressor****. Among those 62 men, 41.5% said the police asked the helpseeker if he wanted his partner arrested; 21% reported the police* ***refused to arrest the partner****, and 38.7% indicated the* ***police said there was nothing they could do and left****.""*

&#x200B;

**Limitations of this Study (You can read more in the actual study)**

I think it would be disingenuous if I just posted this here without discussing some limitations. This was an exploratory study because it is truly the first of its kind because it dives into an analysis of the experiences of male victims of domestic violence.  Many of the victims were found online and in spaces where men talk about domestic violence. From the Study:

> The sample was recruited from multiple sources, including the Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men and Women (DAHMW), a national helpline specializing in men who sustain IPV; through ads on online websites, newsletters, blogs, and listservs that specialize in IPV, male IPV victims, fathers’ and divorced men’s issues, men’s health, men’s rights; and through a description of the study on the Wikipedia page about domestic violence. Potential participants were told and advertisements stated: “Researchers at Clark University are conducting a new study on men who experience physical aggression from their female girlfriends, wives, or partners. If you are a man between the ages of 18–59, have experienced physical aggression from your partner within the past 12 months, and have sought help for this problem, you may be eligible to participate in this study. We invite you to follow this link to complete an Internet survey.” 

They also had to meet the eligibility criteria that are specified in the report.

Despite this, there is the possibility that some respondents' reports are not completely genuine though the authors note that it would be irresponsible to claim that even a majority of the reports are falsehoods.

As I said, this study is the first of its kind. There isn't much attention/funding put towards studying male victims of intimate partner violence at all, even though it's pretty clear that men and women experience IPV.  Furthermore, men are discouraged by the experiences of other men, a loss of ""masculinity"", feelings of shame, and the stigma that only women can be victims. 

**Compared to the experiences of Women**

Even though I'd like to talk about this within a non-comparative framework, I've always noticed that discussions about men's issues tend to be mixed with conversations about how these experiences compare with women's experiences. 

It is clear that women have starkly different experiences with social services for IPV. You can read more in the Discussion section

>These findings are in stark contrast to ratings of social services by battered women. For example, in a study of 119 women who sought services for DV-related concerns from a DV shelter, 89% of the clients believed that they were helped by the services that they received and 84% reported that they felt better because of these services 

([Source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1049731507307790?casa_token=hKvt2ogkLXkAAAAA:Q9Yz8vMDNb2OyCuyiN7w8hbVB2F69pva4Q6j68xdj-DHsYBQS6Fi8Vq5nUWXI-dHMkZLdfl2MHyMbcE))

And despite the prevailing narrative against police and handling IPV, women tend to be more satisfied with police assistance.

>Similar results with regard to satisfaction among battered women have been found in relation to police assistance. For example, one study of 95 female IPV victims indicated that the female victims found the police to be very helpful and 80% would contact the police again for assistance.

([Source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801203255554?casa_token=wUzAVe3qIXQAAAAA:kZpKAgGPi7FGuq_M6oU50FDwttugfWq5vh-c9lDMSE0dgmemxeLR-5BpU3SbjKNWPcthz2h_4Bx7TSM))

**Conclusion**

Intimate Partner Violence is a huge issue for men, and much of the prevailing narrative surrounding male victims re-traumatizes them instead of helping.

2020-10-30 23:10:15,When you do everything right but it feels like not enough.,"I know these are signs of depression. I am not misguided in this.

However, I am in a situation where I have been Verbally Abused, Physically Abused, Mistreated and otherwise inside my workspace.

&#x200B;

Some of it was deal-able due to circumstances. Now it's gotten to an apex that I just do not know how to handle. Hell, even my puppers has caught onto my mood and how disheartening it is.

&#x200B;

I have worked with a construction company as their IT guy. I have had some members underneath me for related things. Things are going well inside the IT department. We have a strict budget and do what we can. I am the manager currently. Or was...

Over the past 2ish years, I have been asked for nudes of my SO, I have been physically hit and roughed up by coworkers (not in my department). I have been verbally abused. I drove 18 hours to be in office for necessity for the employee who acted like such a child to ignore me and then ""go on vacation"" day 2. Before he left in a wonderful display of an older gentleman throwing a temper tantrum he had said ""YOU HAVE TO RESPECT ME, I can call you worst things you motherf\*\*\*\*\*, yeah worst names..."" I had blanked out the rest.

Because of circumstances, I have been part time for 8 months. I wanted to return to full time. We had just enough work to allow for it and I had talked with the owner about such. He said he does not see it being a problem and let's talk more in depth later.

The Owner proceeds to ignore me while I was in town. And then when I returned I was ignored all the way up until I got an email from the owner. I have a new boss and I am to ""maintain course and report to him"". Okay. Well, we do not have enough work for him but okay.

This has hit me harder than anything. I have been applying for positions for a few months now when the VP told me that there is no reasonable answer for me to come on full time and it would be best that I find a different position. Some of the work picked up recently and I figured it would not be so bad. Then I get the news of this.

It has been the worst situation I have ever been in. I am applying and being super proactive. Hell, I'm sure I'm annoying the crap out of people and then with the pandemic, it's even worse.

I finally talk with my supposed boss yesterday and the dude has no concept of IT Security and really is just 6 years behind current tech. It's terrifying. He will be and will continually be a security liability. Even moreso, they are trying to ""make an MSP"". I would never touch that service, ever.

&#x200B;

On top of this I keep having BS dreams of leaving my SO who I am so in love with and I wake up TERRIFIED. I wake up like it's reality and then I reach over and she is there, thank God..., but then I just have this terrible feeling after waking. It terrifies me to leave her and these dreams just torment the shit out of me. I have not had actual nightmares in a very long time and this is the closest thing I could think to a nightmare.

&#x200B;

She has been so helpful through all of this and is trying to do everything she can to assist with my mental health but it's just becoming crushing. I have (thankfully that they are fleeting and not fully serious and upfront) fleeting ideas of ending it all. Or just straight up quitting but that puts us in a horrible position and I cannot do that to the both of us. I just do not know how much more of this stuff with work I can actually handle and I can't leave the situation until something pops up. Which has been a multi-month process. I am even currently in an interview cycle that has still been 6 weeks since my interview because they want to ""find a comparable prospect""...

&#x200B;

THEY LIKED ME! And yet! They still cannot pull the trigger. They've interview 6 others at this point and have not found someone of my caliber which is more infuriating!

2020-10-29 00:18:32,How men's groups gave me the space to get over the postponement of the Olympics and a few questions of how I can best reach people with my own group now.,"Hi men. 

I'm an athlete on the Great Britain Cycling Team and as of March this year was a world championship silver medallist in line to be competing at the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in August. The rest of the story everyone will be familiar with. The coronavirus struck, the Olympics were cancelled/postponed and I was in full lockdown here in the UK. I hit probably a 5 year low (perhaps not all time as I had a previous descent to the ashes dropping out of university before I made it as a cyclist) and the thing that lifted me out was joining a men's group.

Sports teams are notorious hotbeds of, for want of a better term 'toxic masculinity' and within my existing circle of a team I felt I had nowhere to go. The men's group gave me the safe place to chat it through and be listened to in a non-judgemental way by other men. I'm 24 and hearing a range of viewpoints and anecdotes/stories from other guys of all ages and backgrounds has had quite a profound effect on my outlook on life on the whole.

Off the back of such a positive experience I started leading my own group in early June to spread the concept to some people in the UK and it's gone down a storm, for all the medals and races I have won I don't think I've ever been as overwhelmed with positive feedback as I have from my men's group and I love meeting with them every week. I still love my cycling but this really fills a void that elite sport was lacking for me. 

Fast forward to now and I'm trying to spread the idea to more people and advertising a paid group. I'm aware that this may cause a shift in dynamic but I want to grow what I'm doing here around continuing to train for next year's Olympics. 

The issue I'm running into is, here in the UK anyway, the reason why I feel the project has such value is also the reason it's proving a challenge to pull off. People don't talk at all. Despite publicly sharing my involvement in setting up the project and doing a couple of interviews with sports magazines and even national newspapers, people are scared of this concept and my own team mates seem afraid of bringing it up in conversation with me. 

In the group I have been leading so far even those who were at first apprehensive very quickly bought in fully. My challenge now to figure out, and question for those more experienced in discussing these topics is, how can I go about reaching the right people with what I'm trying to do?

My social media followers are almost all cycling fans and I've had 4 members join from that pool but I'm getting very limited engagement and feel like I'm missing the mark. Does anybody have any experience in promotion in this area? How would you go about it?

2020-10-28 04:57:01,"Jane Elliot's ""Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes"" resonates with how we look at manhood.","If you don't know who Jane Elliot is, she is a school teacher turned diversity educator and is famous for her ""Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes"" exercise. The exercise is pretty simple, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott), but I wanted to talk about a particular [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi3iqJykwEo) and how it resonated with my experience as a man.

In the beginning of the video, Jane Elliot starts out with:

>Perception is everything. White people look vicious, and ugly, and non-caring, and cruel, and arrogant, and powerful, and condescending...and angry.

She then turns to a white woman in the crowd and asks her if she's angry. She says no, she then turns to the white lady sitting next to her with the same question. This lady answers ""trying not to"". Elliot then asks her if it takes a lot of energy, she says yes. Elliot asks ""are you holding it in?"", the lady replies yes. Elliot then asks ""if she's trying really really hard not to react to her"", the lady replies yes, again. Elliot continues to ask questions like ""Does \[trying not to look/react to Elliot\] take a lot of energy?"", ""Is \[trying not to look/react to Elliot\] hard for you?"", etc.

The lady continued to reply yes. 

This line of questioning goes on for a while and culminates with the question, ""if you had to do this every day what would happen to your blood pressure."" and without hesitation, the lady replies that it would rise. 

I'm a black man and I've seen this clip many times in the context of racial discrimination, but every time I watch it, I think less of my blackness and more about my masculinity. The very adjectives that Elliot uses are words that I've heard to describe the ""danger men pose"" particularly to women and children. I'm often described that way, expectedly and unexpectedly, by friends, family, and strangers. In general, it's something that I wear on my back along with the added stress of being black. 

And I don't think I'm the only one. The stereotype of men as predators, unempathetic and powerful, hurts men who are victims of domestic violence when it comes to getting assistance from shelters ([they are often assumed to be perpetrators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/)) and when it comes to getting temporary restraining orders, [male petitioners succeed less often, even if you control for the level of violence](https://www.verbalabusejournals.com/pdf/research/court-custody/restraining%20orders.pdf). [Men are often given longer sentences](https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx), [even after controlling for family responsibilities, offender characteristics](https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1120434), and other legally relevant variables. 

When it comes to gender equality, we're often [ignored](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-men/201705/gender-and-mental-health-do-men-matter-too) because we are often assumed to be the standard. Suicide rates are often blamed on unproven claims of ""masculinity which may encourage suppression of emotions or resort to anger."" Claims like these assert to have a rigid definition of masculinity, one that connects being a man to suppression of emotion and anger, and one that certain discriminates against the multi-faceted nature of the billions of unique masculinities. 

The point I'm trying to make is that the adjectives that Jane Elliot used to get white people to empathize with the experiences of racism are similar adjectives to what I, and I suspect, many other men are called every day, overtly or covertly.",True,193,0.94,66,,/r/MensLib/comments/jj9r1t/jane_elliots_blue_eyesbrown_eyes_resonates_with/,theromanshcheezit
2020-10-27 00:54:39,Pay For Your Porn,"I've seen some discussion elsewhere about people's resistance to paying for porn, and as someone who has been a sex worker I wanted to share a plea: if you want your porn consumption to be ethical, you NEED to pay for it. Yes, there is no fully ethical consumption under capitalism and we're all doing the best we can with what we consume, but it is particularly important with porn to ensure that what you're consuming is ethical. 

I'm going to break this up into sections. First:

**Why you need to pay for your porn**

I could write pages of reasons for this. But above anything else: don't you want to make sure you're not watching someone being raped or abused? I would assume any decent person would. When you're consuming porn from free porn aggregator sites, there is no way real way for you to know if there is any meaningful consent for the performers you're watching. If we are interested in liberation for all, that includes sex workers

There's also no way to know if the performers you're watching are being fairly paid for their work, or if they have consented to their work being found on those sites. When I modeled for SuicideGirls and similar sites, I agreed to have my photos or videos up *on those sites* and was paid for that. I was not paid for the photos and videos that were pulled by users and posted elsewhere and I received no profit share from that. I did not consent to my photos and videos appearing on other sites. 

Other people in the porn industry express similar concerns with free porn sites:

>""The free tube sites are a very controversial business model that has been profiting from other people’s work, image, bodies, creativity, and talent for the last decade,"" she said. Her own films have been stolen and uploaded onto tubes, often with sexist or racist titles with her name nowhere to be seen.  
>  
>  
>  
>""Clearly tube sites are not a vehicle of promotion for me,"" said Lust. ""Most importantly, neither I nor my guest directors or performers have given consent for having our material there. Whether they know the content they have in their platforms is stolen, we cannot be sure, but it’s happening all the time."" - Erika Lust

Purchasing your porn also helps encourage a market for porn created in safe, ethical environments where meaningful consent is possible. 

**Where can you pay for your porn?**

There are TONS of sites where you can buy feminist porn, and that doesn't just mean sites where you pay to pay an expensive monthly fee. I don't want to make this post seem too much like some kind of marketing post so I'll post some links in the comments. 

**A personal note**

Look, I understand that most of us aren't swimming in money right now. I understand that there's a TON of free porn available. I understand that most people are in the habit of just consuming that free porn and not thinking twice about it.

They talked about one coach having social justice conversations with his players, to learn from his players. How 2 coaches got past not knowing what to say to each other. How another coach came back to coaching to be there for players. And towards the end, one commenator asked another if he or his son was better at their job; the guy's response went through some things senior and junior were each better at but that he would sit the fence on who was better. After a followup question, he replied (as I best remember) something along the lines of that's what he does for people he loves. I wonder whether I actually heard that, but I hope I heard right.

Maybe it's more common than I think and I'm just not paying attention, but it seemed unusual to me. Do you think so?

# INTRODUCTION: What is Masculinity?

>**By Jake Stika, NGM Executive Director**  
>  
>Masculinity is a performance. Masculinity is relational. Masculinities are plural.  
>  
>My masculinity is different than yours, which, in turn, is likely different than that of the next man you see.  
>  
>Being a man doesn’t inherently make me masculine, either. A trans friend taught me this, sharing the story of how he had to relearn how to look at his fingernails, or how high to place his hands on his hip. Try it yourself: when you look at your fingernails, do you do it with your fingers stretch out, or with them curled in?  
>  
>Whether I’m on a basketball court, in a boardroom, at the pub, or in the bedroom, my masculinity will be different in each context. Athlete, professional, buddy, or lover—each time, the identity I don is a bit different. It’s a performance, and it changes based not only on the setting, but also the other players taking part in the scene.  
>  
>My masculinity is influenced by my race, ethnicity, citizenship, class, education, sexuality, relationship status, ability, and even height. I was never great at math, but I do know that the potential outcomes for these permutations and combinations are damn near infinite. This is masculinity as the **personal**.  
>  
>Masculinity is hard to pin down. Binary thinking such as right/wrong, yes/no, black/white, leads one to suppose that masculinity is the opposite of femininity—but what then is femininity?  
>  
>If we entertain this binary, we are practising gender essentialism—the attribution of fixed, intrinsic, innate qualities to women and men. This is harmful not only to trans and nonbinary folks (because it completely erases them) but it’s also harmful to men and women. It imposes measuring sticks for us to fail against.  
>  
>If traits such as nurturance, supportiveness, and affection are the essence of femininity, how can I ever be the doting father I hope to be? If traits such as leadership and assertiveness are the essence of masculinity, how can a woman ever thrive in roles of authority?  
>  
>This idea of sex = gender is a stumbling block. Equating our genitalia with how we should exist in the world—well beyond our roles in procreation—has caused nothing but heartaches and headaches to people of all genders and sexes.  
>  
>This is masculinity as the **political**.  
>  
>Together these ideas of masculinity as the personal and the political make up a system we know as patriarchy. Patriarchy’s etymology is from the word *pater* (father) and *arkhein* (to rule). Here are some theories for the origins of this system, borrowed from Noah Yuval Harari’s *Sapiens*:  
>  
>**Muscle Power**: Simply, men have the physical strength to overpower women into submission. A slightly less overt version being that men had the strength to hunt or plough the fields giving them control of food production, therefore clout.  
>  
>**Violence**: Women can match men as far as hatred, greed and abuse are concerned, but when push comes to shove, the theory goes, men are more willing to engage in raw physical violence.  
>  
>**Genetics**: As men competed against each other for the opportunity to impregnate fertile women, an individual’s chances of reproduction depended above all on his ability to outperform and defeat other men. A woman, on the other hand, had no problem finding a man willing to impregnate her. However, if she wanted her children to provide her with grandchildren, she needed to carry them in her womb for nine arduous months, and then nurture them for years.  
>  
>Each of these is problematic in their own right and easy to poke holes in but after the past 70+ years of discussion about women’s roles and identities in society under the banner of feminism, it’s very clear that none of these serve any of us, whatsoever. Further, the advances made in decoupling work from manual labour, diminishing violence globally, as well as family planning, have all helped create tremendous opportunities for people.  
>  
>Women have taken full advantage of shedding the yoke of narrow conceptions of femininity, and have advanced in many traditionally male-dominated arenas. But, for some reason, we men stubbornly cling to man-boxes we can barely stretch out in. In this way, gender stifles us, frustrates us, sets us up for failure, and leads to men causing harm (to more folks than just ourselves) under the banner of ‘masculinity’—whether subtly, like through the pride that keeps us asking for help or the drive we have to dominate, or more explicitly, such as through substance abuse, violence, or self-harm.  
>  
>We’ve come to do a great job of telling our daughters that they can do anything that boys can do. We can’t say we do the same for our boys. Until we go just as far to tell our sons that they can do anything that girls can do, then we’ll forever be stunted in our boxes. Until our society expects men to thrive as parents as we expect of mothers, then fathers will always continue to feel secondary.  
>  
>In other words, we need to put an end to the notion of men ‘babysitting’ their own children. We need to normalize men holding roles in early childhood education or caregiving, or we will just keep stunting men’s ability to express their emotions, and pathologizing those who do.  
>  
>It’s time to drop the measuring sticks. It’s time to set ourselves up for success, so that all individuals can express themselves authentically, and so that the ways in which we understand our own gender, sex, and identity don’t keep feeding the systems of patriarchy that hold us all back.  
>  
>Let’s drop the performance, relate to one another with integrity, and embrace the multitudes within each of us. That’s my hope for the future of masculinity. Or, should I say, the future of masculinities.  
>  
>My hope for the future of masculinity is that we drop the measuring sticks associated with masculinity and femininity and embrace the authentic expression of all individuals while collectively tackling the system of patriarchy so that we can drop the performance, relate to one another with integrity, and embrace the multitudes within each of us.

2020-10-24 14:57:45,"""They aren't built the same way.""","Sometimes, even in the most liberal corners of the universe, the ""old ways"" still creep out. Modes of thinking that are regressive and ridiculous, even when associated with some infinitesimally tiny truth beneath the lies. In this case, I can't say just how liberal the offending person was, I can only say that this is within a group that's most definitely not fighting for anti-feminist values. 

I (a guy) was in a political volunteer meeting last night. For about two hours, a group of 25 men and 75% women worked together to talk through all sorts of technological, organizational, and other issues. We're human, we had disagreements, but it was civil, logical, reasonable...hey, I thought, this is a great team! The backbone of it are women over 50, and you can 100% believe they do a backbreaking amount of work. Without them, this whole operation would be a useless mess (mostly because not enough guys are showing up to help!). They're involved in all parts of the operation, top to bottom (including my own mother), so there's no question that they're integral to the work.

We finish, and I stick around in order to talk to the group's director (also a man) about a new role I'm fulfilling, and one other, older guy (same age as the average women) also stays in. I figured he also needed to clarify a few things, so I didn't think too much of it, until he said the following, partially paraphrased: ""I've been a volunteer coordinator for years, worked with a lot groups, and I know we have a lot of women here. I think we know they aren't built the same way, and that's why I keep pushing for us to be more concerted about recruitment."" 

""They aren't built the same way."" In context, I'm assuming he means they aren't aggressive enough? Lord knows, but I just sat in silence and let the director try to deflect away from that statement and talk about general trends on volunteering (agnostic to sex/gender). In the back of my head though, I was just trying to tick through possible reasons why someone would say something like that. Sure, these ladies were born and raised in an era where being more reserved about things is normal, but the folks in this call sure as shit didn't qualify for the moniker ""reserved."" Maybe ""polite,"" but they've been chasing down volunteers just as readily as I have (more so even). 

The truth is this guy is sexist and thought he was in a safe enough space to reveal that bullshit. Weird that, given I was literally wearing feminist campaign merch on a camera for two straight hours, but I suppose old habits die hard. The only reason I didn't call him out then and there on this was 1) I'm relatively new to the group and 2) it doesn't have the best control over its own IT (so dropping him from the group safely for everyone is not a simple matter). 

Solutions? Fortunately, this is slightly easier than many other situations (which is a privilege I wish everyone had). My mom has been working with this group for quite a bit longer, and has enough of a rapport (and power) that I don't need to worry about whistle blowing (initially to her/to discuss things appropriately, then to make a more formal complaint) and worrying that it will come back to haunt me. Even if it does, hey, I'm a volunteer and I have no issues going to the next group and putting my hours in there. 

No matter what though, it validated my opinion that there is a generational problem that we need to work on. Not just teaching older men to treat women correctly (in public or private), but to believe it in their souls. That there is no ""safe space"" or ""good opinion"" that involves claiming women are somehow built differently or unable to fulfill the work they're assigned to simply based on their chromosomes.",True,176,0.93,30,,/r/MensLib/comments/jh4iv9/they_arent_built_the_same_way/,SOL-Cantus
2020-10-24 05:26:40,How internalized transphobia kept me from realizing I was attracted to boys,"Around the same time I figured out I wasn't a cis girl, I also figured out that I like girls and nonbinary people. That was about four or five years ago. It took me until this year to realize I actually like boys as well. The idea of being in a relationship with a guy used to make me deeply uncomfortable, so I always assumed that meant I just wasn't into dudes. It was only very recently that I did some self-reflection and found out the actual reason why.

The only boys that ever showed interest in me were straight boys that didn't understand my identity, so I couldn't really picture a queer guy being attracted to me. Every time I had pictured being with a guy, I was actually picturing being with a \*straight\* guy specifically. I felt like if I dated a guy, that would somehow make me a cis girl. Because of my insecurity about ""acting too feminine"", I felt that if I was in a relationship with another guy, I would end up being the ""woman"" in the relationship. 

The uncomfortable feeling that I got when I pictured being with a guy was actually dysphoria. And as I've gotten better at accepting myself as a guy, that feeling has started to go away.

2020-10-22 22:29:47,Positive outlets for male sexuality?,"So, recently, musician Lily Allen released a sex toy, and it got me thinking.

Obviously, male sexuality isn't stigmatized in the way female sexuality is. In most spaces, men can talk about all the woman they've had sex with (usually in more misogynistic terms), and if a women talks about sex she's shunned.

However, at least for me, I don't live in the circles where those discussions happen - and I'm happy about that. *But*, there isn't an alternative. In progressive circles, positive open discussion of sexuality isn't a thing. Hell, I'm pretty sure if a male musician released a fleshlight he'd get mocked to the ends of the earth. This isn't a complaint about what Lily Allen did, I think normalizing sex and masturbation is totally fine, I just wish that there was room for that for men in progressive circles.

Personally, at times I almost feel ashamed of my sexuality. I say this as a Bi man, and by ashamed I don't mean towards my attraction to men, but ashamed of being sexual. I feel like I can't bring it up even jokingly without straying too close to the classic example of sexist dudes bragging about getting laid. There just isn't a framework for healthy, open, joking discussions about male sexuality, whereas for women it's normalized - again, only in these specific circles. 

How can we change that? How can men talk about their sexuality in ways which are healthy, joyful, and non-toxic? How do you deal with the stigma that you feel?",True,1470,0.96,388,,/r/MensLib/comments/jg0o7u/positive_outlets_for_male_sexuality/,lordberric

2020-10-21 14:05:04,What is your story behind you not showing emotions / not crying?,"What I mean by this question is: Is there a reason / reasons you generally avoid showing emotions or crying in front of others (if you do actually avoid it)? It could be an event in your childhood or similar stories to that. 

I think if we shared those reasons it could shed a lot of light on why exactly men generally don't like to show emotions as much, instead of just blaming it on ""toxic masculinity"". Maybe the TM-argument isn't wrong per se, but I personally find the ""oh, it's toxic masculinity's fault""-argument way too simple, surely there must be other reasons for it.

&#x200B;

Here's mine:

The reason I generally dislike (and still kind of do) showing emotions / crying in front of other people is that, as a kid (kindergarten / elementary school), I cried. **A lot**. During sports lessons when we were playing games like football, baseball, dodgeball etc. whenever I lost, I would start crying. Or at least get angry up to the verge of crying and make up excuses as to why we lost (our team only consisted of kids that were bad at sports, the other team had all the sporty kids in it, the other team cheated, etc.). In short, I was a very sore loser as a kid.

Obviously, that didn't make me very popular at kindergarten or school, so whenever I'd get made fun of by my other classmates and I'd get even slightly upset, they'd start teasing me with ""oh, you gonna cry? You gonna cry now, huh? Cry, do it!"", their goal was obviously to make me cry so they could make fun of me for it. I was also known among the teachers as the sensitive kid. (Though they didn't make fun of me for it. I think. I don't quite remember.)

In kindergarten it was probably worse than in elementary school, because the combination of me crying easily and having a terrible haircut (my hair reached down to my shoulders on very bad occasions) made me an easy target. Yeah, I was also teased as being a girl. Because I had longer hair than the other boys.

Those bad experiences as a kid caused me to bottle up my emotions when I grew older. I'd say it probably helped me avoid a lot of flak for crying, because after middle school, the bullying against me pretty much stopped. (It probably also had to do with the fact that my classmates grew up too.)

I think the last time my friends ever saw me crying after elementary school was that one time I was ugly crying while drunk. And it wasn't a very pleasant experience either. They at least didn't make fun of me at the moment, they were trying to comfort me in their strange way (less of ""it's okay man"" and more of ""come on, man! Stop crying! Let's go back to the club and get a drink!"", which is better than nothing, I guess.), but they still tease me to this day for that evening.

Nowadays, I still only really express my emotions in private (especially crying), because it makes me really uncomfortable to cry around other people, except if we're at like, a funeral. I did notice that I'm more comfortable crying around my family, mainly because they didn't tease me relentlessly for doing so like some of my former classmates did.

So, I'm passing the question off to you. What is your reason / reasons? Are they similar to mine?

&#x200B;

Edit: It seems to me that a couple of users read my question as me implying that there's something wrong with men that generally don't show emotions or don't cry. That wasn't my intention with this post, it was more to just listen to other men's stories as to why they may not cry, as I had some bad experiences in my childhood which caused me to not cry a lot as an adult.

2020-10-21 02:51:27,"I feel like there's two different pressures acting on gay and bisexual guys-""hyper-masculinity"" and ""hyper-femininity"", and it's tearing me apart.","Explanation/tl;dr: I'm a cis masculine bi guy, and I feel like most gay and bisexual men have societal and cultural pressure put upon them at the same time to fit in to a ""hyper-masculine"" or ""hyper-feminine"" way of acting/presenting themsleves, and the competing cultural forces can cause men significant problems in their mental and physical health. I'll explain in a bit more detail below.

By ""hyper-masculine"", I'm referring to the idealisation of traditionally masculine body types and professions in the gay community. Take for example the constant pictures of gay models/pornstars/influencers etc. who have chiseled abs and bodies like a Men's Health cover model or a greek statue, or how much gay imagery centers on more ""masculine"" archetypes (like the Village people or a Tom of Finland drawing).

Gay and bi men can feel enormous pressure to look like this perfect body-type, because a lot of gay media puts these guys front and center - from social media to pornography - or in dumbed down language ""Wanna fuck guys? Look like this"", which leads to men doing dangerous things to their bodies to achieve these goals, like heavily working out, developing eating/body dismorphic disorders, fixing ""flaws"" with plastic surgery, or getting hooked on drugs and partying.

This idealised masculine image hurts feminine and androgynous men, who are often already excluded for their sexuality aand breaking gender norms, and also more masculine men who may feel like they have to conform to these gender norms to ""compensate"" for their sexuality.

On the flip side the stereotypes of all gay men being effeminate can do significant damage as well. For feminine men because they face violence for being the way they are, and risk being reduced to this one particular facet of their identity when they're so much more, and for more masculine men who may feel like they're ""not allowed"" to be gay or will not be believed about their sexuality by openly LGBT+ people because they're not effeminate, alongside violence from straight people who assume that they're secretly feminine (or *could/must* be) because of their sexuality. Couple this with the prevalent attitudes of ""men are trash"" (that came up in a post on here recently) and the stereotype of the LGBT+ community being full of man/masculinity-hating-sjw types that can further entrench the idea that feminine = untouchably perfect and masculine as ""literally satan.""

As a bi guy trying to make sense of my place in the world, I feel torn between these two ideals, with one side demanding that I'm a greek statue who somehow has time to balance a traditionally bloke-y blue collar or professional job with living in the gym 24/7 and being a party animal, while the other side wants me to be the sassy gay best friend stereotype, who's neck deep in ru-paul gossip or fighting the good fight on the gender studies front line. At times it can really affect my self-image, and and the way that the different ideals are emphasised by competing media sources (traditional and social) can leave you feeling stuck between a rock and a hard place, while in real life most people wouldn't give a toss how you identify/present yourself.

I feel like there's little space for being ""boring"" or (for real lack/want of a better term) ""normal"" in gay or bi spaces, like you have to fit in to these moulds or risk being a gay pariah, as if you can't live in a small regional town or suburbia and come home from your shitty retail/office job to just sit on the couch and watch netflix all night. No, you have to be one of these stereotypes living in the cool big cities living an acceptable, marketable lifestyle.

I know trans men face similar issues with their gender identity and presentation, but I'll leave it up to a trans guy to elaborate on that in the comments because I don't want to talk for you.

2020-10-19 04:40:23,"In my country, military conscription for men is mandatory at all times, and I'm really mad about it. What can I do to spread awareness or change the law.","This is my first post in this sub and is going to be long, I am a 15 year old brazilian (my birthday is next month), and in my country military draft is mandatory for men and women at war times, but only for men at peace times and voluntary for women, every boy that is 17 (in the year they turn 18) or 18 have to enlist, about **5-10%** of them are selected to serve for one year, during this time they cannot have a job and are not paid for serving, **you can be selected even if you don't want to**. If the person does not enlist, they have to pay a fine (I think if you pay the fine you can get away with the next cons), can't work, can't study at universities, can't make passports for other countries, and i don't know if I am missing any more cons, then the other year again, you have to enlist or pay the fine...

About **1,5 million** boys conscript per year, less than **100 K** are selected to serve for one year, during which **they are not paid nor can't have a job**, you enlist online and if you are not disposed (too much people for the vacancies, they dispose a lot of people before they have to take tests, if you didn't want it you are lucky, if you did, bad for you, nothing you can do about it) you have to take medical tests, wait in lines, be interviewed... they ask you if you want it, most of the people that say they don't want to take the draft don't take, because the number of people the military needs is small compared to the 1,5 mil boys, and a lot of people who want to enter the military actually want to take the draft, but even so, there are a lot of boys that **EVEN AFTER SAYING THEY DID NOT WANT IT, ARE SELECTED**, and people who wanted that were disposed, so these people have to lose one year of their lives serving, not being paid, suffering humiliation, not working, there is a law that says they can take their job back if they were selected, but if you are a boy waiting for a job opportunity and waiting to know if you are going to serve, people are not that fond of hiring you, because they know there is a chance you will have to be away for one year, this system fricks with the young people that want to take colleges, or want to work, even if you don't want it, went to the headquartes, waited lines, tested, interview... and was disposed, you lost your time, a lot of people are unsatisfied by this but I haven't seen people protesting against it, I have seen discutions, there are polititians against it but it just doesn't get the visibility it deserves, and as one boy I can't do a lot, but what can I do as boy to try to make a difference? Trying to discuss it more on forums and reddit, talking to friends about it? trying to begin an online campaing against it? I don't want people to protest right now because there is covid, but it's not like I could unite poeple to protest anyway...

Short explanation of the brazilian mandatory service in english: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription\_in\_Brazil#:\~:text=In%20Brazil%2C%20conscription%20is%20mandatory,Fonseca%20was%20Minister%20of%20War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription_in_Brazil#:~:text=In%20Brazil%2C%20conscription%20is%20mandatory,Fonseca%20was%20Minister%20of%20War).

TLDR: I want to know what I can do to make people more aware of this so something can change, because in the compulsory conscription, you waste time if you don't want to serve the military and there is a change you will have to do slavery analogue work if you did not want it.

Edit 1: **bolded** some phrases and important points

Edit 2: thank you very much for your comments, ups, and award! I'm gonna try a lot of what you guys told me, also, maybe women can't conscript right now, if they can't, i think they are soon going to be able to conscript **voluntarily**, I am just acknowledging that I am not sure so I don't spread misinformation.",True,1510,0.97,118,,/r/MensLib/comments/jdnutv/in_my_country_military_conscription_for_men_is/,MaiaArthur

2020-10-17 06:23:16,"Post-industrialization, working class men and the alt-right","I recently heard a point that I've been circling around for a while stated really well (from the Swedish language podcast Komintern if anyone is [curios](https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1485460595/komintern/s04e02-hogre-veckopeng-billigare-godis)). Hopefully this isn't too rambly or off-topic, I'm posting it in this sub because I legitimately think it's important for progressive male advocates.

Basically, a couple of decades ago, working class men in large scale worked in various industries while working class women to a large extent worked with children, elderly or as nurses.

Today, many industrial jobs have been automated or moved overseas while more female coded jobs don't face this threat.

Since men typically are expected to be providers this means that the unemployed men who would previously worked in the industry it makes their lack of a roll in society even more pronounced.

During the 2016 US election Trump talked about bringing home overseas industrial jobs. While he hasn't been terribly effective at this, and indeed would probably mean that these jobs would be extremely poorly paid to be globally competitive, it was still a concretely important question for a large number of people.

The rhetoric of the alt-right is also something that is very appealing to a large number of disfranchised men, because it's about reclaiming mens traditional role in society in a very ""masculine way"".

Incel culture also fits in well with this. Women typically are more interested in someone who has a stable life as compared to men who typically are more interested in youth and beauty. Women who aren't successful by male standards have comparatively good relationship prospects.

As people who are opposed to the alt-right and similar movements we ought to find an alternative way to address these issues.

While they aren't typically part of the alt-right, this hits migrant men even harder who usually have an even weaker position on the job market. For example, many Muslim migrants joined IS a couple of years ago for what I'm guessing in similar reasons.

The problem will likely only get worse. Right now, many men work in the transport sector. Many of these jobs might disappear as well with self-driving cars.

One possible way to address this is to weaken gender roles to allow men to more easily work in currently female-coded jobs. This will make things better for men, but only by spreading the unemployment out over women too. It's not as good of a solution as one that creates more jobs. Getting rid of the patriarchy is a hard process so it's not something that can be done particularly quickly either.

Another way to address this (and many other things) is to end capitalism. This is also a bit hard to pull of.

A milder version of this is to restructure the way society works in a slightly less radical way to address the shrinking need for labor. For example, we can consider the 6 hour work day or a sufficiently generous UBI plan.

A further way of addressing this that I'm quite exited about is the green new deal. Often environmental politics is put in opposition to industrial jobs, but the truth is that in order to reach our climate goals a lot of work is required, and much of this work looks a lot like traditional industrial labor. Building green industrial plants and high-speed trains and what not is going to provide a lot of jobs for people who would perhaps have worked in a steel factory 50 years ago.

2020-10-16 05:16:00,"A Personal Experiment in Privacy, Confession, and Mental Health","I've tried to kill myself before. I've struggled with my mental health for a long time. I was told I may be on the Autism spectrum, have depression, and have social anxiety. It lead to me dropping out of high school before completing and has made it difficult to finish my BS degree as well.

My mental health these days is significantly better and it is due in large part to the strength of my connections with my friends and family who help me and guide me and make me feel better about myself on a daily basis.

I learned something in the past decade. I am terrible at picking up on social cues if they are not very explicit. If someone convinces me why my behavior or attitude is destructive, I try to change it, but I need open conversation for that. My friends taught me a valuable lesson over the years. The more I opened myself up to them, the closer we became and I became (in my opinion) a better person and a better friend.

Recently I decided to do something kind of unusual to see if my life story and past mistakes and personal shame could maybe help other people. So I started a YouTube channel and made a lot of very personal things public. I would like to hear the thoughts of people in this community about what I discuss in the video as well as my psychological report, which I have posted in the description of the video in a redacted format.

Nothing I ever do on YouTube will ever be monetized or used for personal, financial gain, so while this is kind of self-promotion, it is not for money.

This video is kind of explicit at points, so I made it age restricted. If you have any comments at all, please let me know.

Thanks for your time.

Love,

Drew

2020-10-14 23:36:14,The destructive stigma around the size of a penis that causes insecurity in men,"I don't know who decided to start something and push this agenda. But since childhood whatever media we consume has pushed this notion that a bigger dick is a matter of pride or somehow more pleasurable for women. And that women want to have sex with a guy that has a bigger dick. 

First of all, it's stupid because it's based on judging someone for something that they have no control over. 
Such notions have given rise to a stupid scammy industry about somehow increasing the size of the penis. Which sucks. 

Second, I feel such feelings are too strongly invoked in men especially due to the media they consume. Mainly porn. Most of the common videos in porn just show them fucking, as in penetration. So that gives a wrong idea of sex to them because those videos are staged, edited and unrealistic to an extent. That coupled with lack of sexual education is what leads to such problems. 

Thrid, using the size of a dick as an insult or for comedic purposes. That just amplifies the insecurities and enables such abuses. 

Lastly, off the top of my head, it boils down to wrong expectations of what sex is. I've had sex and I hope most would agree that penetration is a part of it, and not the whole thing. The key is everything else that's happening and penetration is a cherry on the top. Penetration alone is hardly pleasurable, so I hope men understand that it's not the biggest deal when it comes to sex. 

Another huge problem is the notion how long does a hard on last. Which is another ludicrous concept. Our bodies create pleasure by multiple actions. So if for whatever reason a hard-on doesn't last for a long time, there are numerous, often better ways of giving and taking pleasure. 

Would love to get everyone's opinions. I don't understand why such things are pushed on us. I feel it's a disconnect between what men think women want and what women want. It's all pushed from various industries that have vested interest in keeping us unsatisfied and fucking up with our mental health. 

What do you guys think? What do you think the solution is? And please share your experiences if you've struggled with such issues. Thanks.",True,149,0.95,94,,/r/MensLib/comments/jb2ywv/the_destructive_stigma_around_the_size_of_a_penis/,shermitt

2020-10-13 00:29:16,How my hobby has been poisoned for me.,"I used to dance Lindy Hop all the time. I mean six days out of the week, three to four hours a night. Even today I still miss it - the music, the joy of movement, dressing up and appreciating cute outfits on my follows. I miss seeing acquaintances and making new friends, having great dances with somebody I just met.

I remember back in 2007 going to my first ""big event"", a weekend of all-day lessons and all-night dancing. The first night all the instructors put on a show for the rest of us. One couple in particular stood out for me - doing crazy air steps and moving so damn fast it blew my mind. I found a video of that performance and would show it to people proudly, saying ""This is what I do! You should try it too!""

Several years later, it came out that the man in that video had taken advantage of his status to sexually assault many women within the community, including his own dance partner. I started finding out that others within the community that I knew and respected had behaved similarly - preying on the women within the community. Videos that I had enjoyed watching before suddenly left a sour taste in my mouth as I recognized faces I didn't want to see, to give respect to. 

It's not like I didn't know there was a dark underside to the community - twice I had female friends of mine come to me about somebody abusing their trust, and I did what I could (listened, asked how I could support them, stood by them as they reported the abuser to the ""bouncers"" at the dance) to help. But I didn't realize just how deep in the community the rot extended, and it really left me with a bad taste in the mouth as name after name got #metooed - deservedly so, mind you, but it left me feeling awful about idolizing these people in the first place.

I've tried to be the change I want to see in the community - before COVID-19 shut down all dancing, I had a brief gig teaching high school kids how to dance. I tried to include a little bit on consent (that it's OK to turn down an offer to dance, and it's OK to leave a dance if you're not comfortable with how it's going) and the kids loved it. I'd like to think I'm doing my part to prevent the things that happened in the past from happening again.

Not sure where I'm going with this from here; it's more of an unhinged rant about how people who I put my trust in spoiled something beautiful for me. There are others who were hurt much worse than I was by the actions of those people, but there are many others like me who also were hurt as well. We are all victims of abusers in our communities - the abused are hurt the worst, but the violation of trust affects us all.",True,1914,0.98,109,,/r/MensLib/comments/j9u4oh/how_my_hobby_has_been_poisoned_for_me/,helldeskmonkey

2020-10-13 10:33:39,How my adjectives have changed when complimenting my friends,"A few years ago I set a personal goal of complimenting the people in my life freely and openly - I want to be a cheerleader for everyone I hold dear. So I made it my mission to give my friends, coworkers, and family heartfelt comments to boost their mood and self esteem, which has been great? However, I noticed that I was using similar adjectives for all women, and similar for all men, which made me realise that each sex seems to have its own ""good"" or ""bad"" traits. I started to notice this in how people spoke to me and my wife, or in different forms of media. So I've recently gone out of my way to try to flip the wording of my compliments. 

Words or themes I now try to focus on. 


Women:

- leadership

- ambition/drive

- intelligent

- problem solving skills 

- academic or business accomplishments

- independent/self reliance

- expert/knowledgeable

- direct requests and thoroughness

- assertiveness or pursuing goals



Men:

- handsome 

- dapper/stylish/well dressed 

- compassionate/kind

- polite

- family oriented

- team player/reliable to support others

- creative 

- contemplative

- playfulness


Since I've made this switch I've noticed better reactions from the people around me. I've never heard an explicit ""wow thanks for bucking gender norms and acknowledging non-traditional gender attributes"", but the smiles have been much larger, the thanks have been much more forthcoming, and people seem genuinely flattered and sometimes taken aback then thankful. I feel like my relationships have all gotten a bit closer and more genuine and open :)

Now we know full well how the male gaze is marketed/catered to A LOT and we can find way more examples of ads, tv, comics and games using half naked women to make a product more desirable. There's also how penises are not seen in media commonly and doing so immediately bumps work up to adults only

However where I see male nudity (in terms of a dude in their underwear) is in this almost invisible section where it's almost as if society doesn't care. 

A man in a pair of boxer shorts is seen as the default in a lot of series as in your typical TV show treats it as another outfit where a women does not get that level of invisibility

You can see it the most in really weird comedic tropes in cartoons (aimed at kids) that has the main character stripped to their underwear (mainly white briefs) which never really happens to female characters. (Think of often you see Honey and Bart undressed vs Marge or Lisa) Like in socie we know it's very bad taste to look at kids this way yet even in modern cartoons this trope gets used.

Look how both Disney Tarzan, Jungle Book and George of the Jungle got away with having male leads in nothing but loincloths and they were treated as fun family films no issue at all.

I've been re examining tarot  cards and their meanings in order to design my own cards for fun.  As old artifacts, they've chock full of antiquated ideas about gender roles and depictions.  There's been plenty of redesigns for more feminist depictions of the women,  which is wonderful.  Ive had no issue redesigning female- oriented cards like the Empress and the High Priestess but...



I'm not sure how to reconcile cards with the men.  So many feminist versions either create them to be feminine figures or negate them,  but I want to emphasize the positive masculine traits they can embody in my art.  What're your thoughts on this issue?

2020-10-12 01:21:12,The Equal Rights Amendment,"I just watched a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP_87IAqItw) from 1973 that debates the merits of the equal rights amendment to the U.S. constitution. It was quite remarkable to me that the proponent of the equal rights amendment was making arguments that were truly about sex equality, namely giving benefits to women that were reserved for men and *giving benefits to men that were reserved for women*!

The (antagonist) host even characterized the pro-equality advocate as primarily supporting men.

The opponent to the equal rights amendment made arguments mostly for the preferential treatment of women. In particular the equal rights amendment would allow women to be drafted, which the opponent believed to be bad and untraditional. Similarly, she defended the obligation of men to support their wives and at the very end supported the presumption that women should get the children in separation.

I do not participate in this community but I thought of sharing this interesting observation. Maybe everyone here knows that the equal rights amendment was intended (who knows how it would have shaken out) to be just as much about giving rights and protections to men as it is to women.

For those who do not know, an amendment to the constitution needs 38 states to individually support it. Only 35 did, so it currently is not part of the constitution.

>Article - Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex.

I know a lot of us feel being independent, tough, resolute are important. I disagree with the narrative that says we shouldn't be these traits.

but if our conception of masculinity means we never allow ourselves to be vulnerable, so we don't allow ourselves to open up to get outside help...then that needs to change.

if opening up means being vulnerable, then I'm owning this! I'm vulnerable!

because I can't think of something more masculine than being self confident enough to:  
be vulnerable -> get outside help -> grow

so men I'm asking us to reflect: what are we not telling our mates?  
what are we not being vulnerable about?

2020-10-10 11:46:58,What does an equal partnership in a marriage look like?,"Based on what I have read/heard throughout my life so far, my general impression is that, in a majority of marriages, the woman makes more sacrifices and adjustments compared to the male partner. However, I also feel like there is a discourse that suggests that a man being his wife’s biggest cheerleader is emasculating, which I think isn’t right either.

My view of an “equal” partnership goes like this – both partners have strengths that complement the other, there may be differences between both partners in terms of professional success, but both have a healthy respect for each other, as well as are seen by the outside world as equals too.

Hence, my questions are:

* What does a truly “equal partnership” in a marriage look like? The areas that I’m thinking about are - professional success, sharing of household responsibilities, emotional labour, and anything else I may be missing.
* Is an “equal partnership” even the right idea? Is there any way I could look at this from a more “holistic” point of view?

2020-10-10 17:32:32,How do I get better at recognizing misogyny in its most subtle forms and how do I better recognize how badly I am affected by society as a male?,"Hello, so as the title would suggest I am a 24 y/o male and I stumbled upon this community and found it really wonderful. I have been to many places on reddit I'm not even going to mention to not give them any visibility and I'm sure most of us already know. 

I haven't really gone to any of those hate-filled places to find something I'm agreeing with. It was more about curiosity. I can't say for sure that it has affected it in any negative way or not. But what I'm sure has is how other male friends would sometimes talk about women. I'm sure every man here has a story about other men talking negatively about women either while hanging out at school, bar, etc...

I have never considered myself a sexist person. I have never treated a man or a woman differently based on their sex. I've listented to ""intellectuals"" (again not going to mention any names) talk about data and scientific facts and I recognize that they're using very real data to come to very bad and ""interesting"" conclusions (after a friend pointed it out to me). I'm not mentioning this as something that I should be rewarded for. I believe that's what we all should do.

But I also say things like ""I'm not really affected by toxic masculinity"" and at the same time say ""It's not that I suppress the need/desire to cry, I just don't have it"" 

So, finally, my question is: How do I, as someone who considers himself as not hateful of any group for any kind of difference they're not responsible for, better recognize discrimination while it's happening? And how do I, in the context of this subreddit, be better at recognizing how my own experiences have still left some ""toxic masculinity residue"" in my psyche?

PS: I come from a privileged position as a male in my society. So while I don't think I have been treating anyone badly for any reason, I understand that I can be really oblivious to things that have almost always happened to someone else and not me. 

TLDR: 

* How do I better recognize discrimination as someone who has never really experienced it?
* How do I better recognize toxic masculinity in myself?",True,68,0.84,43,,/r/MensLib/comments/j8hmxa/how_do_i_get_better_at_recognizing_misogyny_in/,MaintenanceLiving747

As an adult, I've managed to get him out of my life and decided I'm all the better for it, but recently I've had my eyes opened to just how much that negative relationship has been an underlying source of a lot of tension and insecurity I still harbor as an adult, especially around money and relationships to other men. 

This is something I'm just now starting to unpack, and frankly, I feel pretty lots. I don't even know how to make sense of some of the feelings and connections I'm making. 

I was wondering if there are any books or other resources out there that people in this group could recommend that might help me unpack the dynamics of how I might still be managing my feelings around this relationship as an adult. 

I know this might be a vague and heavy ask, but anything you got for now would be appreciated. I remember reading No More Mr Nice Guy and just how much that book opened my eyes to how my relationship with my mother was affecting how I still show up in the world today.

If you and your lover want to play around with that, more power to you. Maybe just be more open to the idea of men wanting to be the one wooed too?

What I want to talk about, are progressive people using arguments or comments that sound pro-women or feminist, but are based on the same patriarchal/misogynistic notions of why men should be chivalrous in the first place. They allude to how something in women's very **nature** makes her less responsible of her actions, because she's incapable of understanding the consequences of her actions. 

It really fucks me up, because this is the same premise that lies at core of the justification of why men are allowed to slap a women around, when she's acting a little ""hysterical"", why women shouldn't drive, work or get the vote. 

I've seen feminist women and men use arguments that seems to be based on this assumption and I don't know how to call people out.

Young men are increasingly isolated, and when they look for ways to improve their lives & health in ""masculine ways"", they often fall into rabbit holes of Jordan Peterson, Pick up artists, and redpilling. My theory has always been that men fall into these rabbit holes in search of the mental health support systems that they lack in their day-to-day lives and this is what is most available to them.

There aren't very many robust support systems for men that aren't normative as fuck. This was until I found the Healthygamergg channel on youtube. And I'm in shock.

Dr. Alok Kanojia is a Harvard Psychiatrist who works specifically with video game addiction, and he's been streaming on twitch for the past year or so. He does webinars, and even live Talk sessions with streamers and average people alike. He knows how to communicate with gamers in a really masculine-coded and gamer-coded way that is really effective at communicating eastern philosophy, meditation and psychiatric ideas to a mass lay-audience. 

I think it's amazing to have him destigmatizing mental health with gamers, and encourages people to work on their problems in productive ways, rather than lashing out.

Obviously his work isn't only with men, but his audience skews that way. What do you guys think of him?

2. **Exercise as an obsession** e.g. Freddie trains 9-10 per week, I used to train 12 times per week

*Some questions I was asked by the defense attorney:*

* *""What is your sexual orientation?"" -* ***I am gay and assuming they knew that, why was it brought up at all? Would a woman be asked if she was a lesbian if she was accusing another woman of raping her?***
* *""Had you engaged in anal sex before your rape?"" -* ***this just pissed me off...and I answered truthfully but again why was that questions allowed and would a woman be asked if she had vaginal sex before her rape?***

*As the conviction process \[hopefully/eventually\] becomes less difficult for survivors, how do we ensure we are paying equal attention to how women AND men are being treated?

[""Like me""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL4ntL58hfk) is a song from [Teen Beach Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Beach_Movie), a 2013 Disney film that deals with two teens from 2013 that magically get transported to the setting of a 1960's musical (loosely based on West Side Story). 

Now, this particular song depicts the clash in relationship views between modern teens and their sixties' counterparts, and I think in spite of its levity there is a lot of interesting points that can be extracted from this. 

Regarding women, how the expectations change from being aloof and coy to taking the initiative (""take a chance, why not ask him on a date?"") and not focusing on pleasing men (""don't dress for him, it's better when you dress for you"")

And about men, not feeling the need to be in charge and in control at all moments (""chill out and go with the flow""), and being willing to be vulnerable (""look in her eyes, and tell her even if you're scared""). 

However, the phrase that got me thinking the most is in the refrain. ""I know what girls like, girls like boys like me.""

Dating and love are an important part of nearly everybody's life, and in a lot of things we do we seek to become our most desirable self in order to realize ourselves in that aspect. However, this is entirely informed by our preconception of what is desirable, which varies from person to person. Not to mention that what other people desire is also incredibly varied. 

Now, I may be reading too much in this song, but it would also admit a reading about pressure to conform, both to the present expectations of people around us, and to past standards and conceptions about relationships (which are still being enforced in the present by some people). 

Overall, I find it interesting this kind of message, particularly in a movie aimed at teens/preteens by a big studio. I'd like to see what you think about it.",True,128,0.95,8,,/r/MensLib/comments/j44p5c/girls_like_boys_like_me/,MarsNirgal

To me, the verse that begins with

> And if I show you my dark side, will you still hold me, tonight?

while especially keeping in mind it's end

> Would you send me packing, or would you take me home?

2020-09-30 22:52:49,Men's Liberation Needs to Be For All Men,"""Until we are all free, we are none of us free."" - Emma Lazarus

""Your right to swing your arm leaves off where my right not to have my nose struck begins."" - John B Finch (attributed)

&#x200B;

Liberation is for all men, not just men who fit certain attributes. It has to be for men of color, trans men, disabled men, queer men, white men, immigrant men, men we disagree with, men we don't like. 

But it also means that making sweeping statements about what your liberation looks like for you and declaring that to be liberation is probably inaccurate. That might not be liberation for other men around you. That might actually be striking them in the nose.

I have encountered a lot of men on here that aren't super attached to masculinity and manhood over the past several months. For some of them, they expressed that their liberation would be the abolition (or, more mildly, abandonment) of gender. This may in fact be part of what liberation looks like to these people.

This is *not* a universal act of liberation. (I doubt there is any universal act of liberation.) I am a trans man and ""man"" is an active part of who I am, day and day out. Search my post history for my struggle with the concept of ""binary man"" but I am no gender other than male (this does not preclude my recognition of genders beyond male and female, btw). Being male and recognized as male is an active part of my liberation as a person. It's something I am still actively fighting for (I've got some state paperwork done, but still working on the name change and federal paperwork). I've lost friends and family over recognizing myself as a man and changed careers for it. To tell me that true liberation is taking that away because it's liberating for someone else is swinging your arm, strike me in the nose, and tell me how liberating arm swinging is.

This does not apply just to cis people. I know many gay man in my community who have fiercely reclaimed their manhood because we live in a society that tells us queer men, especially certain queer men (twinks, bottoms, drag queens, flamboyant gays, etc) aren't ""real men"" and place them in a separate category. Their manhood and masculinity is a badge they wear on their rainbow crop top at pride. That ""gender nonconforming"" masculinity is an active part of their liberation.

I am also a disabled man. I will never master Krav Maga or be a ""protector"" or any number of modern dominant culture stereotypes by the nature of having multiple neurological disorders that sometimes make ""lifting a cup of tea"" my master achievement of my day. Not meeting those stereotypes AND finding a powerful masculinity in myself is an active part of my liberation - even if it's not part of yours.

If you're not man and not being a man is part of your liberation, I am so very, very happy that you have found this part of your liberation! That's wonderful and I hope your journey continues to yield success for you. 

But for those of us for whom being a man is a part of us, I think there are healthy and wonderful ways to look a healthy, liberated ways of being a man. My personal favorite avenue of viewing it is through the lens of history and culture. Our modern dominant culture is just that - our modern dominant culture. Toxic masculinity has not always been here and will not always be here. I have been reading Thomas Foster's Sex and the Eighteenth Century Man as well as Mary Beth Norton's Founding Mothers and Fathers for a side project of mine and it's fascinating how a mere four centuries ago, we looked at things differently - and how some of those differences did, indeed, lead to today. We haven't always been where we are today and we won't always be here.

Let us revel in our differences and our different needs rather than demand conformity and sameness.",True,263,0.95,78,,/r/MensLib/comments/j2nlqv/mens_liberation_needs_to_be_for_all_men/,grayperegrine
2020-10-01 08:35:55,Video: WTF is Up with Men's Fashion?,"Hello! I have been writing about men's issues for a while now, sparked by personal experiences and what I see online. I think men are in a pretty crummy place right now, socially speaking, and not enough people are talking about the real issues they face. Most discourse I see on the subject is either ""men are trash"" or ""men are the most oppressed,"" neither of which really gets at the core issues. I am currently studying Sociology/Feminist Studies, and I watch a lot of youtube videos, so making video essays seemed like a logical next step in trying to communicate with a wider audience. I personally like videos with a lot of research, but have seen a lot of videos based on pure anecdotes do well, like all those dumb redpill type videos. I don't want to stoop to that level, but I am trying to talk to average men who might be more persuaded by stories than facts. Let me know what y'all think! <3

2020-10-01 00:44:06,"Where do we get our (non-patriarchic , non-misogynist) ideas about men's sexuality?","I asked a version of this question at r/AskFeminists, because I am interested in explicitly feminist ideas, but a few u's suggested I asked here as well. 

When I was an adolescent (boy), my mom had a copy of *Our Bodies, Ourselves*.  I read it and developed a feminist understanding of women's sexuality. But later in life, it occurred to me that I never had a comparable, feminist-informed guide to my own sexuality. Because I was raised by feminists as a feminist, I developed a feminist sense of my own sexuality, but I honestly don't know how relevant my experience is to other men. 

So I'm wondering where boys and men and feminists can go to learn about male sexuality. I understand there are a lot of resources about what male sexuality *should* look like as the end point of a process of (self-)liberation, per feminism. I'm looking for a starting point - resources that say, ""here's where you are, here's how you get to where you ought to be."" The male version of *Our Bodies, Ourselves*, if you will. 

To be clear, I am absolutely not here to defend or argue about male sexuality in any way that excuses the harm men do. I am most interested in references to books, articles, or websites - what sorts of things men on here have found useful in forming their own ideas about sexuality in their own process of liberation.

2020-09-30 02:53:28,"""Positive Masculinity"" is unsatisfying. Here's what we should be talking about instead.","*Masculinity* is dead.
Long live *masculinities.*

Let's talk about the state of masculinity in the modern day.
I think we all have a pretty good handle on the topic of Toxic Masculinity, a set of societal pressures on men which encourages us to inflict harm on ourselves and those around us. 
We recognise Toxic Masculinity as that voice in the back of your head that tells you not to seek out help if you are unwell, physically or mentally, and that anger is the only acceptable emotion to express publicly.

We also recognise that so-called traditional gender roles have failed us.
They have denied agency and political power to ~50% of the population, outside the domestic sphere, and left fathers distant from their families.
Traditional gender roles also deny the existence of people who do not easily fit into them.
We recognise that a family does not always comprise a cis man who works and a cis woman who raises 2.4 children in a house with a picket fence in the suburbs.
Humanity is far more diverse, far more interesting and always has been.

If we recognise that it's time to tear up the script, then our next question is inevitably ""What shall we replace it with?""
This is, I think, why the most common kind of post in this subreddit is some variant on ""What is positive masculinity?"" or ""Which male role model best embodies positive masculinity in your opinion?""

Those posts are fun.
They're easy to participate in.
However, I also find them quite unsatisfying.
There's nothing uniquely male about resilience, vulnerability, leadership, or confidence, to list  a few common responses.
For rolemodels, we like to bring up Terry Crews, Mr Rogers, Jean-Luc Picard, the Lord of the Rings cast, and whoever starred in Marvel's latest blockbuster.
They're all great guys, I'm sure, but they don't have much in common with each other.
This new Positive Masculinity we're trying to define ends up looking muddled and confused.

So where do we go from here?
We accept that there is no single, unified positive masculinity.
Instead, there are multiple, overlapping *masculinities*.
We can see a this clearly in what used to be the highest ever upvoted post in our subreddit.
I am, of course, talking about [""Queer Eye"" is Actually a Fantastic Example of Positive Masculinity](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/80eczi/queer_eye_is_actually_a_fantastic_example_of/).
The hosts are all masculine, without question, but express that masculinity distinctly from one another.

Under this new paradigm, masculinity goes from being some prescriptive, something you can fail at, to be descriptive. Multiple masculinities comprise multiple overlapping spheres, like Venn diagrams, where some of us have a lot of overlap with one another, and some of us are more adventurous in our gender expression.
Instead of trying to define a new kind of hegemonic masculinity, which will always seem like a cage to some of us, we embrace the fact that while we are all masculine, none of us are quite alike.

I propose that, from now on, instead of asking ""What is *positive* masculinity?"" we ask ""What is *my* masculinity?""",True,1084,0.94,303,,/r/MensLib/comments/j25na2/positive_masculinity_is_unsatisfying_heres_what/,delta_baryon

2020-09-28 07:46:47,"""You're the most emotionally closed off man in my life"". How to learn to be emotionally open?","Last night I was having a conversation with my girlfriend and she told me what I said in the title post. I was taken aback because I do not see myself as emotionally closed off, I always saw myself as emotionally open. I am a pretty open minded guy and not too serious, I tend to joke around a lot. 

I talked to her to find out what she meant. She told me I'm great at being there for her and letting her talk to me and share her feelings. She said I am very supportive and reliable. She told me she sees me be open with my friends and help them when they need it no matter what, but the issue is that I never seem to let others in. I don't talk about my life, my feelings or my past very often. Looking back, everyone I have dated has said some variation of that- they say I come off as distant, closed off or mysterious. 

I know this not a problem exclusive to men, but it seems much more common with us. How can I learn to be emotionally open? I always feel like if I tell people my emotions or my struggles I am bothering them and burdening them. Also, I grew up in an abusive home and the easiest way to minimize the abuse was to never react to anything that was thrown at me, emotionally or physically. 

I have found strength in stoicism and controlling my emotions so I don't get hurt or hurt others, possibly becoming logical and unemotional to a fault. I know a lot of other men struggle with this, what is a good way to combat it?

2020-09-26 11:35:12,High School a Microcosm of Society?,"Hello everyone, I’m a soon to be 20 year old male in my sophomore year of college. I grew up with a lot of trauma both at home and at school, and have been reflecting on it in order to hopefully heal. 

A perspective that I have come across in my reflections and through my various psychology and sociology courses in University has been extent of the effect of human nature on behavior. I hypothesize that most humans act purely based on ingrained biological behavioral tendencies and their environment. This might be a Captain Obvious statement, but applying this theory has been able to help me explain the social behavioral tendencies of others through middle school and high school that I wasn’t able to explain while in those stages of my life. I am striving to find a more robust theory to social behavior than “High schoolers are immature”. For context, I live in a wealthy and relatively diverse area of Maryland and went to high school as an awkward, skinny guy with glasses. 

In my time in high school, I saw all of the different types of people. What I noticed is that the entire spectrum of society from rich to poor, attractive to ugly, white, black, Muslim, Jewish, etc. was represented in some form or fashion in my school. It looked from the outside to be a perfect high school-aged cross section of modern society. This sounds great, but it was actually a very strange dynamic. 

The different demographic groups separated and created cliques. The black kids had their own group, the poorer white kids had their own, the rich-white-Catholic-popular kids, the Asians, the Indians, Muslims, nerds, Jews, etc. The extent of the segmentation of these groups still blows my mind, as these groups were so segmented as to be indistinguishable to the untrained eye. There was a generally unspoken rule that these different groups did not associate with each other, except for example at parties when the rich white kids would invite the black athletes over. Not to say that these kids didn’t talk to each other in a cordial fashion or as acquaintances, but they were clearly separate groups. 

The nature of status as well was something that I look back on in reflection. Popularity in my view resembled a bell curve with the ultra-popular at one end, most kids in the middle, and the nerdy/poor/ostracized at the other end. All of the idealized forms of status in society were reflected in popularity. The pretty girls were at the top with the muscular guys, the black athletes were just below, the drug suppliers were around there, and so on and so forth. As you can probably guess, I didn’t have a very good time. I hypothesize this is because of biological tendencies to favor humans with ideal reproductive and/or socially desired qualities such as height, muscularity, and dominance in males and attractive physique ratios in females such as the the hourglass figure. The socialization aspects come into play when considering skin tone, athletic pursuits, drug/alcohol usage, etc. So for those that don’t fit into these ideals, there is the “middle class” of popularity and for the very unfortunate there is the low end. 

My question is, how much in your experience has high school proven to be an accurate representation of society at large given the demographic cross-sections of your high schools? Do you still observe these behaviors of different cliques based on similar race/ethnicity, socioeconomic standing in the real world? Are unattractive or poorer people still ostracized to that degree outside? How much credence do you give to my idea of the bell curve of popularity based on genetically hardwired human biological preferences and socialization?

>By now, it's a widely accepted fact that people with ""Dark Triad"" personality traits - narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy - are more likely than other people to aim for and/or achieve power, for a wide variety of reasons. And while some people blame capitalism, I think that even in a society straight out of a Le Guin sci-fi novel there'd be a very concrete risk of a takeover by self-serving master manipulators: indeed, even the most well-intentioned IRL revolutions ended with the most cunning and ruthless on top, either as leaders or, much more frequently, as pernicious behind-the-scenes influences.

2020-09-23 23:57:08,Friendly Reminder: You are worth taking care of.,"TL;DR: your physical body is a wonderful, precious thing that is worthy of care and maintenance.  And hopefully this isn’t the first time you hear it.

I’m fortunate that I grew up with male role models who generally were pretty good. One thing that these good men had in common, though, was that they all shared this unspoken value that a man’s body is a tool, a resources that he uses up and wears out for the good of his family. If a man arrived at the end of his life with a broken, worn-out body, but his spouse was comfortable and his children were thriving - that was seen as reasonable, and maybe a bit heroic. 

What this meant was that things like good diet, recreational exercise, sleep, and medical care were all seen as a low priority. These were all subordinate to the higher purpose of taking care of your family and whatever else was meaningful in your life. 

For context, here is an example. As a young adult, I just didn’t go to the dentist for about five years because I didn’t value taking care of my body, and I didn’t feel I had the resources to spend on it anyway. I could have asked for help from my parents, but I was determined to stand on my own because I didn’t want to be a drain on the family. See how that all fits together?

Anyway, when I got married and got health insurance, my wife finally begged me to go to the dentist.  Unsurprisingly, I had several cavities that required multiple fillings. 9? 12? I actually don’t remember, except that there were separate fillings in each of the four corners of my mouth. And I’m grateful that I had access to that care. But honestly, I could have prevented needing that care if I had a different value set. 

Over the last few years, I’m proud to say that I’ve grown in this area. I saw a primary care doc for the first time as an adult. I quit drinking (at least for now) and started running (hopefully forever). And I’m just so grateful to have discovered that there is a better way to live. I feel amazing!

So if you’re anything like me, this is a friendly reminder that your physical body is a wonderful, precious thing that is worthy of care and maintenance. 

For your own sake, please eat well, sleep enough, and exercise regularly.  Please brush and floss, buckle up in the car, and wear sunblock at the beach. If you’re sick or injured, try to take the time to rest and let your body recover. 

If you can, see a dentist every six months, and see a primary care doc once a year. Stay up to date on vaccinations, like flu and tetanus. If access to care is an issue, check with your local health department. You may consider looking into the technical college system that trains dentists or dental hygienists. They usually have very cheap cleaning options for patients who have time for a student to do the work and be supervised. 

Remember, if you had a child, you would do all this for them because it’s good for them - and you personally deserve no less!",True,839,0.97,57,,/r/MensLib/comments/iyctze/friendly_reminder_you_are_worth_taking_care_of/,run_saw_law

2020-09-24 04:26:45,"The Boys, and Masculinity","The Boys, a very popular Amazon Original, has recently debuted its second season, and has started to touch on some interesting ideas regarding masculinity, and toxic masculinity specifically.

**Spoilers abound!!!**

Set in a world where superheroes are real and are marketed and commodified as they likely would be if they were in our world, The Boys focuses on a crack squad of ragtag criminals who all have beef with superheroes, and work to dismantle the privileges and power that dominate their culture.

The two characters I want to primarily focus on here are Billy Butcher and Homelander. Both I think are two sides of the same coin of toxic masculinity, and who will likely go down different paths regarding dealing with their issues (as long as the writers have half a brain).

Billy Butcher is at once a man with a depth of emotion and love for his wife, and at another, a man with a deep, brooding rage that is destructive not only to himself but those around him. He leads The Boys, and is the most ravenous in his desire for vengeance against superheroes, most importantly for killing his wife ,as he thinks, throughout season 1. In the most notable example of his rage in Season 1, he abandons his friends in a murder-suicide rampage to try and get back at Homelander, the superhero who rapes and murders his wife. When Butcher returns in Season Two, he is still deep in these toxic ideas, still lashing out at his friends for not going on his destructive rampages (such as during his violent efforts to capture another character, Kimiko’s, brother). When he reunites with his supposedly-dead wife, she eventually rebukes him as putting her on a pedestal which had, in some respects, pushed her away from him.

And then there’s Homelander. As the leader of The Seven this Universe’s Justice League, he is analogous to Superman in this Universe, if Superman was a miserable, broken asshole. He has laser vision, he can fly, and he’s virtually indestructible. He is also an incredibly vulnerable and hurt man that can do anything he wants or make anyone bend to his will.

Anything, except make them love him. 

Homelander suffers from extensive trauma from his upbringing, essentially without parents, growing up in a lab environment and built from the ground up to be exploited by those above him. This all has, of course, gone to his head, and now sees any human as beneath him, which is ironic given them again still having power over him with the approval he so desperately craves. He uses violence and force against others without a second thought, which further drives people away from him.

Butcher and Homelander both seek approval and love from those around them. The difference that will make or break the two of their journeys, however, is the people around them at this stage in their journeys. Butcher has Hughie Campbell, a man who has demonstrated a willingness to be vulnerable and, over time, a growing willingness to call out Butcher on his bullshit. His macho man aggressiveness is not impressing anybody, and it only hurts those around him. Homelander, as it is increasingly shown, only has people either willing to exploit him, such as Edgar, the CEO of Vought, the company that markets superheroes, or Stormfront, a *Nazi* who likely only gives a shit about Homelander in the sense that he can help her get what she wants. (I *cannot wait* for her to eventually get her just desserts, because again, she is a *Nazi*)

I find the writing decent in portraying these ideas and am hopeful that they won’t fuck it up. There’s more I could go on to, such as The Deep (this universe’s Aquaman) and his struggle with his own body and how he turns the shame he has for his own body and turns it against and abuses women. (I’m not really liking the whole cult thing he’s getting involved in as a story, but if that’s part of the OG comics, well...🤷‍♂️)

Any thoughts folks? I’ve been eager to have a bit more in-depth discussion about how this show is tackling these ideas, because the show subreddit sure as hell ain’t.",True,33,0.95,37,,/r/MensLib/comments/iyicek/the_boys_and_masculinity/,mandolin6648
2020-09-23 10:47:03,Nussbaum's work on dehumanisation.,"One of my favorite things about Menslib is being exposed to new (or new to me) ideas.  A very good recent example of this was a comment discussing ""dehumanization"" cut and pasted here -




>""Nussbaum's work on dehumanisation in general has been enlightening for me, I'd suggest everyone at least have a cursory glance over her seven properties of objectification.

>-Instrumentality - ""You are valuable only for what you can do for me""

>-Denial of autonomy - ""You lack the ability to make informed decisions""

>-Inertness - ""You have no power over your own actions""

>-Fungibility - ""I could drop you and replace you without consequence""

>-Violability - ""I am allowed to hurt and damage you. Your boundaries are meaningless""

>-Ownership - ""You are my property""

>-Denial of subjectivity - ""Your experiences and feelings do not matter""

>I think we can identify a lot of the trauma men-as-a-group experience with these properties, especially instrumentality, fungibility, and denial of subjectivity.""

I definitely agree with the original poster with respect to the three items on the list that they've highlighted as particularly pertinent to men,  but I think I'd add violability to my own list in a roundabout way.   Insofar as (as a recent post put it), ""men's bodies are their defense"", I think it's also generally assumed that men *don't need* boundaries.   If only for the idea that any transgression against our boundaries are considered so slight that we'd be fools to complain about them at all.   Less ""I am allowed to hurt and damage you because you're less than me (or unable to stop me)"" than ""I can abuse and attack you, and you've no right to complain because..."" (is this working in tandem with ""denial of subjectivity"" at this point?)

Do any of the items on this list speak to you in any way?  If so,  which?  In what ways do you feel dehumanized by patriarchy?  Any particular examples you'd share? Anyone know of any other works that address this?

Also, there are people claiming that men get wrongly combative when they're accused.

It also feels like it throws away the presumption of innocence out the window.

2020-09-22 00:48:05,How to cultivate people in your life who are comfortable with reversing gender roles?,"After some soul searching I'm fairly confident that I'm either non-binary or simply just not cut out for the ""male"" social role.


I'm realizing that I'm way happier assuming a more feminine role, but I'm having a really hard time with being confident in that role and having people in my life who are not only accepting of it but also comfortable enough to encourage it.



I realize part of that is on me because it's really tough to go out and portray myself as feminine (I find myself defaulting to a more masculine presentation so I don't get side eyed) but even the friends I have who seem accepting of the feminine parts of me I choose to show seem a little... anxious about it I guess?


I'm just wondering if there are some ways I can explore this side of myself with people who are truly accepting. I've hidden this side of me away for so long that I feel like I need the chance to actually explore it socially in an environment I can make some mistakes.


I guess I'm a little lost on how to do all that as someone who's both very introverted and feels a lot of pressure to simply act masculine since it's the easier thing. Romantic relationships are probably a conversation for another day but I hit a similar barrier because I tick a lot of man-boxes (tall, wide shoulders, masculine face) and I just can't imagine someone, guy or girl, wanting to flip roles around.",True,58,0.88,13,,/r/MensLib/comments/ix45hz/how_to_cultivate_people_in_your_life_who_are/,girlytransthrowaway
2020-09-21 00:09:57,Being gay and children,"So as a gay man,  I'm used to straight men being stand offish with me.  It's not a reflection of me as a person, but if their own bias and something they need to work on. What is troubling to me is the way people perceive men in general around children and doubly gay men with children. 

Kids love me,  I've always enjoyed engaging with younger people of all ages, but I love toddlers.  Every day is something new and they are constantly engaging.  Little kids in the 5-10 range really love me because I will find out invent games or tasks. I also don't mind explaining things even if it's 20 questions in a row.  I've noticed when I'm out with my nieces and nephew, if my sister isn't near,  that I get strange looks.  If a child I know runs up to hug me people stare. I always feel judged for being an adult man that interests with kids.

I also love tutoring and helping with STEM subjects,  but try being a man saying he'll work with your 13-16 year old.  People just distrust us. 

Now I understand that men can be very gross,  and do things that are reprehensible.  The judgemental looks, though,  when I'm in public interacting with kiddos is hurtful.

My family was unfortunate to have an actual pedophile become a member of the family. I had bad feeling about him from the start, but thought it was because of the way he observed me interacting with my nephew.  On Christmas I always receive at least 1 novel as a present and usually start reading it while things are winding down. My nephew likes to sit on my lap and play with the iPad and this man would stare like it was a traffic accident. Now that he's in jail and the family can talk with relief I mentioned I never said anything because I'm used to the vibe he was giving off from people. If I'd said something, the person who ultimately discovered his perversion would have taken me seriously and looked into things sooner. 


So that's my ramble.  I really just wanted to give some perspective.  Men can be loving towards children without alternative motives, but if you have an issue then say something.

Edit: I wrote this because I saw something that sparked that irritation of bias against men being competent caregivers, and honestly didn't expect much of a response. The comments have been pouring in steadily since I posted tho. Maybe this will be one of the things that starts to change in the near future as we tackle gender norms. :)",True,1267,0.97,106,,/r/MensLib/comments/iwgn4r/being_gay_and_children/,thebolda

I've spent a lot of time on this sub, in my own head, and other places seeing masculinity completely deconstructed. Frankly I have been wondering if it's really relevant at all any more, or whether it's an archaic framework that takes severe mental gymnastics to healthily adapt to a modern understanding of gender and sexuality. And while those questions aren't necessarily settled for me now, I feel like this experience is clarifying a lot and opening up new avenues of thought, and I thought some people here might appreciate it.

____________________________


So, I started seeing this girl recently. I hadn't had sex with anyone in a bit over a year due to a variety of factors, largely the triple combination of refusal to use dating apps, difficulty integrating into a new city after moving cross country, and the good old 'rona fucking over any progress I had made on the former after months of work. I finally bit the bullet and redownloaded tinder and bumble after I realized that fantasizing about everybody I passed in my car or handed my credit card at REI was making me a bit uncomfortable with who I was starting to become. Needless to say it was pretty miserable, but I got lucky and got a decent match inside a few weeks. 

The conversation started with a haiku battle that gave me a instinctual sense of who she was and how she thought pretty quickly. That is to say, I felt a sort of commonality that was strengthened as we started talking about what we were looking for and sharing a bit about our backgrounds. There was a sort of unspoken mutual understanding that we were pretty much compatible and almost certainly going to date; this made talking about our sexual preferences, even more long-term ones that require some trust, exciting. Meeting in person was a little weird, as it always is, and definitely reinforced my distaste for the apps. I know if we had even a modicum of in-person interaction to go off of we would have had a better feel for each other before the first date and there'd be less awkwardness (masks REALLY didn't help). But now a few dates in she's pretty much warmed up to me, the connection between who she over text and irl has solidified, and we've started fully settling into the connection we sensed off the bat we would have.

**(end of dumb shit you probably don't care about)**

When we first started getting physical after a few dates, I noticed a difference between her and girls I've been with in the past. I'm no stranger to having my hair stroked or my neck kissed or anything like that, little spoon type shit, but it usually happens with long-term partners and even then pretty rarely. It's not something I want to have to ask for, and even when I make it clear that I'm into it they sort of treat it like a rare treat when they're feeling overwhelmingly affectionate or protective or whatever the word is. Before this girl it hadn't ever entered the normal flow of my sex life in a stable way.

I'm a mostly dominant person by nature, but I do have a bit of switchiness I guess you would say. This girl describes herself as a switchy sub, which makes us perfect fits. The way our dynamic shakes out (even in just making out or cuddling or something), is I find myself starting off in this role that's a little more macho. I'm looking down at her, I'm holding her head in my hands, wrapping my arms around her, etc. You know what I'm talking about here, feeling muscular, feeling in control, etc. And this is definitely my normal orientation, and does make up the biggest chunk. But after a certain point it gets flipped, and she's stroking my hair, kissing different parts of me, etc. I don't feel submissive (though maybe this is me misunderstanding the concept) so much as just cared for, wanted, prioritized.

As I said above, these aren't new experiences for me. But the frequency is a total 180 from anything I've done. Instead of happening once in a while in moments of vulnerability, it's becoming part of the regular cycle of our interactions: hookups and the aftermath, but also normal coexistence. I should probably mention that she's 6'1"", maybe an inch or so shorter than me but tall enough such that the normal variation of her footwear means she's pretty much oscillating around my height. And so far I am loving it, it allows me to pretty much shift at will into a mode where I feel short (obviously kind of rare for me) and somewhat more feminine (no offense to all my short kings out there. You dropped this: 👑). So as we're walking I can put my arm around her waist, or throw it around her shoulders and lean into her.

It's making me aware of something that's always been happening inside myself, something I had never seen clearly before. Recently I've tried open myself up to a bit of what I feel is femininity. I got a pretty floral tattoo (big ups to Gene Coffey in Queens, the og of the watercolor style), pierced my ears, sometimes will experiment with painted nails, etc. It feels natural to me and though it's subtle relative to a masculine build and style of dress I feel like it's brought me on the outside more in line with how I feel on the inside. Takes some vulnerability too, and I've noticed certain changes in the way that strangers treat me that took a lot of getting used to. 

Now, I'm not sure what exactly makes this girl act differently than anyone I've been with in the past. It definitely manifests as her being particularly attracted to me, but I think that's my own perceptions translating it. I don't think anything in a relationship happens in a vacuum: what compels you do whatever it is you do with your partners? I think there are certain unspoken signals that sort of guide our actions. And though it's impossible to say for certain, I think me opening up myself up to some internal femininity probably led to some unconscious signals that helped lead to her treating me the way she does.

I've had very little time to get used to it but what I'm noticing, and **the reason I felt compelled to make this post**, is this: *it actually makes me more comfortable being masculine*, or dominant, or in control. With the gift of hindsight, I can see that in past relationships I felt deep down like I was keeping up an act, somewhat fraudulent and fragile in being the man in our interactions. Any experience I had of having my hair stroked on someone's lap, for example, wasn't frequent or sustained enough to give me what I needed. And what that was, was the chance to recharge. By analogy: I'm pretty much an extrovert, but when I'm forced to act that out for sustained periods of time it starts to get exhausting and unfun. I see the same with masculinity: my father, for instance, is able to drop his self-expectations in some ways but keeps the globe on his shoulders for far too long in others. All this is to say that I've learned it's very important to explore the internal distinction between acting out a static vision and being attuned to your own dynamic nature.

**TL;DR** even for the most masculine people among us, keeping it up 24/7 is absolutely exhausting and infeasible. Allowing some femininity to enter into our selfhoods can actually be an interesting way to facilitate relationships and situations that allow us to recharge a bit, and this only makes masculinity more sincere, easier to practice, and more honest.",True,1688,0.97,144,,/r/MensLib/comments/ivxf5p/dating_somebody_new_is_showing_me_how_rare_it_is/,TheEnemyOfMyAnenome

2020-09-19 09:27:18,As if,"This post talks about a rather severe scenario and the surrounding views, but I believe these same biases affect the treatment of men more generally, and so this is part of a broad problem.

Sometimes I see sentiments conveyed, either explicitly or implicitly, that I [a man] don’t have much to worry about from street violence or the like.  Sometimes it’s a general discussion of men, sometimes it’s a small discussion with friends, and so pertains to me specifically.  Either way, the idea is that, as a man, I could just fight off attackers or something.  These views always bother me, because they thrust upon me the role of the strong stoic man, who can fend for himself without any support, and who is familiar with violence.

&nbsp;

* As if I could bring myself to commit violence, even in defense  (I don't want to find that out).

* As if I wouldn’t freeze up when threatened.

* As if I’m not every bit as afraid for my life in a dangerous situation.

* As if my body isn’t every bit as vulnerable to fists, knives, and guns.

* As if men aren’t the predominant victims of violent crime.

* As if a bystander would come to my aid as often as they might for a woman.

* As if I haven't been stalked, assaulted, and raped.

&nbsp;

I have no problems admitting that I can be weak in this context.  Well, I’m probably an average strength man, but I am definitely not a confident fighter.  That role should not be painted in broad strokes over the vulnerable walk of life of almost all people, men and women alike.  **Being afraid of violence is not cowardice in a man, it is typical of being human.**  I wish society would allow for men more empathy, which is often incongruous with the brutish framing we are often seen through.

2020-09-18 16:00:58,Let's talk goals,"I've been having some thoughts lately and I think I need some second opinions on those thoughts. For example, in this reformation age of masculinity and what it means to be a man, we are focusing a lot on deconstructing toxic masculinity. This is a good thing as men can get out of the proverbial box that defines men so narrowly.

It's freeing and empowering to know that men can be whatever they want to be and that they should chase their happiness as they feel best, just like any other person should be allowed to. But there is some cognitive dissonance for me. Not because we are breaking with expectations, traditions and traditional masculinity but because of this idea that, men and women (and everything in-between/outside) are equal in almost every aspect.

If we want to condemn what typically was associated with masculinity and femininity, because it was too restrictive and associated a lot of what we consider ""strong"" traits with men exclusively, and what we considered ""soft"" traits with women exclusively, then what is the goal exactly?

* Is the goal to break down all walls and instead of saying we are trying to redefine masculinity, we are redefining humanity?
* Is the goal to redefine what it means to be a man, and if that is the case, does it mean that we are assigning new traits to masculinity/femininity?
   * As an extra question to that, doesn't that mean we are kind of going back to what we did before, but with a fresh coat of paint?
* Is the goal to acknowledge the few differences we have and then define us by those undeniable differences while allowing anyone to attach any trait(s) to masculinity/femininity/non-binary-ty?

There are probably other possible goals i didn't consider, but these are just some of my thoughts that I hope some of you would like to add some of your own opinions and thoughts to :)",True,36,0.88,25,,/r/MensLib/comments/iv1yc4/lets_talk_goals/,DynMads

2020-09-17 20:50:12,Looking for advice with my 5 year old son who has questions.,"Hey all. 

My wife and I, both women, are raising a beautiful 5 year old little boy. One of the reasons I joined this sub is to immerse myself in better ways to raise an independent, sensitive, and kind boy into adulthood. My dad is wonderful but is 12 hours away. Same with my amazing brother. I’m a social worker and I’m fairly well versed in most things, but I’m not living from a male perspective. So here I am. 

I’m hoping for some input on specific questions my son has right now about his body. 

He came to me very concerned a few days ago because he had an actual erection. He wanted to know what was wrong with his penis and how to make it go away. I explained to him that there was nothing wrong. I told him that his body is working exactly as it should and that this would happen for the rest of his life, and that it’s important for his body to use all its parts to keep them working. He asked if it would poke a hole in his underwear. Once assured it wouldn’t and that it would go back down he was fine and moved on to drawing robots. 

We’ve been using anatomical terms with him since he learned to talk. He’s pretty advanced with science and language and has anatomy books for kids and has begun writing. I have always tried to answer any questions he has age appropriately. We’re not into body shaming and we’re trying to teach consent early by encouraging him to give or receive affection when he wants it only (no, you don’t have to hug anyone bud, a spoken goodbye is fine) so he understands how to respect other’s boundaries too. 

Anyway- my question is this. What do you wish you would have learned about your body when you had questions? What did your adults do well, and what do you think you should’ve learned that you may have missed?

2020-09-17 03:30:58,Where do trafficked men go for help?,"I volunteer with a loosely organized coalition that provides harm reduction supplies, food, and wound care for the unsheltered, sex working, and drug using populations of my mid-sized-to-large American city. One of the populations we prioritize highest is sex workers, because of their limited ability to access traditional and institutional resources. (Aka the pimps hate us less than the social workers and will sometimes actually let us treat their abscesses).

Last month, a man at one of the camps we visit asked for help. Let’s call him Liam. Liam is an unaffiliated (aka not being trafficked or beholden to a pimp) sex worker. But for a few days now a pimp had been following him, and at one point even chased him down the street. We’re all pretty sure the pimp was trying to abduct him and traffic him.

This isn’t an unfamiliar situation to us, we’ve helped many women get into shelters and will often times make phone calls and press people and be annoying until a bed appears in a safe house.

But we’ve never helped a man being pursued like this before. Usually adult male sex workers are unaffiliated and engaging in survival sex work. And when they are trafficked, there’s usually a legal or financial dependency on their abuser, not a physical threat like abduction. (Only in our coalition’s experiences, I can’t extrapolate outside the populations we serve).

So we did our standard operating procedures and went looking for a sex worker or domestic violence shelter that could take him. But we ran into a wall. They were all for women and children. Lots of women’s shelters and youth shelters were available, but they didn’t accept men. Even our favorite org to send sex workers to is specifically for trafficked women and children. 

This city is one of the human trafficking epicenters of the nation, and yet no one was helping the male victims! I eventually said screw it, and was going to tell Liam that he should claim to be a pre-op transgender woman and go to one of the LGBT friendly women’s shelters.

Luckily, however, when we started making calls and explained the situation, the shelter for trafficked women and children made an exception for him. We haven’t seen Liam since, so we’re praying that means he got help and got safe. (We’re pretty sure he’s not dead though, the coroner helps our coalition and lets us know when someone matching one of our missing is found).

But you shouldn’t need an exception to get help as a male victim of trafficking! The existence of women’s shelters and youth shelters is important, but there needs to be more resources and help for men who are trafficked.

2020-09-16 21:10:47,"I want to protest injustices that men face in my country, but I don't know what to do.","For context, I live in Switzerland. Keep in mind that many sources that I'll post will be in German.

&#x200B;

In the recent years, we've experienced many protests of different kinds (Women's Marches, BLM Protests, etc.), but there hasn't really been any protests of similar size for men. 

The same goes for where I live, Switzerland. There has been Women's marches and BLM Protests, but when it came to Protests for Men's Rights, for lack of a better term, there has been zero. (out of convenience I'll refer to Protests for Men's Rights as Men's Marches from here on.)

The general consensus around whether we should organize Men's Marches or not is ""Well, nobody's stopping you from organizing a Men's March, why don't you make one?""

So I thought, fine. Let's make one then.

But now I've hit a wall. From looking into previous Men's Marches, they've always been shouted down as alt-right gatherings and got counter-protested to hell. Considering the horrible reputation Men's Marches already tend to have, there's also the question of ""who the f--- would even want to join a Men's March?"" 

The obvious answer would be ""well, march with feminists!"". While not technically a bad answer, one would face an entirely different set of problems there. Because first of all, one would immediately be accused of trying to derail women's issues because they brought up men's issues in a feminist protest. Second of all, considering most people attending the feminist protests would be attending because they want to (rightfully so) protest women's issues, someone protesting men's issues would just be drowned by the absolute sea of people protesting women's issues.

Considering groups caring about men's issues are almost non-existant in Switzerland, I have no idea who I could talk to.

What I want to do with these protests is to raise awareness about the issues that men face and hopefully gain enough support to solve them altogether, one day. These Men's Marches would likely take place around International Men's Day (around November 19th).

As for the issues that men face in Switzerland, there are the following:

[Mandatory military conscription for all Swiss men.](https://www.ch.ch/en/performing-compulsory-service/) I for one am not yet a Swiss citizen, but I'd like to be one day. But if I apply for citizenship, I'd have to either go to the military every year until I'm 37, do civil defense service every year, pay a tax which makes up 3% of my annual income (or at least CHF 400), or go to prison. I don't want to do military service or civil defense service that women don't have to do, neither do I want to pay a tax that women don't have to pay. So since I can't apply for citizenship unless I do one of the above, I won't be able to vote. On top of that, there's recently been a bunch of scandals in the army ([up to 190 recruits getting food poisoning](https://www.blick.ch/politik/lebensmittelvergiftung-in-armee-jetzt-ermittelt-die-justiz-id15457654.html) in one barracks, [recruits collapsing and dying during marches](https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/grenadierschule-in-isone-rekrut-stirbt-bei-leistungsmarsch), etc.).

[Higher retirement age for men.](https://www.ch.ch/en/retirement-age/) Sure, one could retire earlier, but it will reduce the pension you'll get from the state.

[No paternity leave.](https://www.ch.ch/en/paternity-leave/) Maternity leave in Switzerland is [already horrible](https://www.blick.ch/news/wirtschaft/mickriger-mutterschaftsurlaub-die-schweiz-steht-bei-der-elternzeit-hinten-an-id15167860.html) compared to most other countries (14 weeks at most, while other countries (i.e. Sweden) have up to **80 weeks of combined parental leave**). On September 27th, 2020 there's a referendum, where Swiss citizens will be able to vote whether or not the country should implement a mandatory parental leave, [however that parental leave is only two weeks long.](https://www.vaterschaftsurlaub.ch/)

[Men, by law, cannot be raped in Switzerland.](https://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/strafrecht_maenner-koennen-in-der-schweiz-nicht-vergewaltigt-werden/44391718)

[About one in five people seeking support in domestic violence in Switzerland are men, while one in four people convicted of domestic violence in Switzerland are women](https://www.luzernerzeitung.ch/schweiz/wenn-manner-plotzlich-opfer-werden-ld.1070408) (keep in mind the number of unreported cases is likely much higher!). Places which help men in domestic violence cases are still minimal. [There's only about three men's shelters for domestic violence in the entire county.](https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/schweiz/maennerhaus-leiterin-beide-seiten-haben-anteil-am-konflikt-133722338)

On top of that there's the higher [suicide rate for men](https://www.obsan.admin.ch/de/indikatoren/suizid), among other issues.

[Men as primary school teachers are highly underrepresented](https://www.maenner-an-die-primarschule.ch/), which leads to a lack of male role models for the students. On top of that, boys are frequently treated as defective girls at school and often punished more harshly (I've experienced this first-hand throughout school).

There's other topics, like men not showing their emotions, sexual harassment, violence in general against men etc., but these are the topics that came to mind (in Switzerland alone).

I've recently been at a podcast about men's issues and discussed this very thing, but I wanted to expand upon the topic here. What we'll be discussing will probably be mostly about Switzerland, but I think whatever advice I'll get here can also be useful for people in other countries, who want to organize protests highlighting men's issues.

2020-09-13 09:57:10,"Evoking the ""female gaze"" and reducing toxic masculinity through role reversal?","A lot of men complain about not feel desirable, or always performing the role of pursuer whilst rarely ever being pursued by the opposite sex and how invalidating that could feel. Yet men have a very limited tool set when it comes to augmenting their desirability to earn the female gaze and how to compel some women to take a more active role in dating. Most men dont even know what appeals to women, due to our deeply patriarchal society that places the male gaze front and centre of our popular culture whilst women are treated as non sexual beings who can never be active agents in pursuing men, unless theyre low value ""sluts"" and are just interested in male utility. The female gaze has rarely been understood. And so men feel lost about what makes them desirable to women, especially if theyre average looking, and what aspects of their features and behaviors they can accentuate or change to better appeal to women. Toxic redpill culture is flourishing because of this. 

 Women have the cosmetic industry, the fashion industry, generations of motherly advice and tons of resources to help them become the object of desire and maneuver through the courting process , which is both disempowering in some ways and places the desiree in a vulnerable position. But its also empowering and advantageous in other ways too. Theres also the question of toxic masculinity that is preventing many men from openly expressing the need to be the object of desire and fulfilling the passive or non active role in the courting process and not always be the hyper agent/pursuer/""predator"", even if many men feel uncomfortable deeply inside about always being the hyper agent and would like to explore other roles.  Some men cant fullfill that role because of changing economics that is making it harder for men to earn a decent wage and perform the role of a pursuer with a healthy bank account whos able to be appealing via socio economic status. 

I know this dynamic can be problematic and we should do away with them in a truly gender egalitarian world, but its clear that we are stuck with it for the time being. As a switch, Id love to be courted by a woman and be the object of desire from time to time. And Im trying my best to do what women have done for millennia and increase my own desirability through bodybuilding, great clothing, investing in a skin care routine, and Ive even dabbled in male makeup. But I still feel like I have so much to learn about what appeals to the female gaze and compelling women to take a more active role in dating and relationships since this is the first year(and a half) Ive actually put effort into this, despite the fact that this issue is has been on my mind for many years. I mean dating advice for men is either filled with Red pill toxicity or advice that doesnt really work in the real world.

2020-09-13 08:34:14,"Men with more than one cultural background, what's your observation of different paradigms of masculinity?"," I am in a curious position because I have observed two different cultural conceptions of masculinity through my life: The one from my natal country (which is also my mother’s), and the one from my father's country. Although both countries are latin-american, they have noticeably different views and I am going to describe them generally in my words and experience.

There are things both cultures have in common. They are both corrective in their expectations; one follows the script or one is stared at, chastised, isolated or even gets aggression, depending on how “grave” one’s “deviation” is. Unsurprisingly, both are homophobic, except on different ways and on different behaviors. In my native country, that homophobia is subtle, mocking and insidious; contrasting to the one in my father’s country, where judgement is more direct and with disgust.

Where I live there is an obvious script, an image of what “A Real Man” is. It has regional variations but there is a general idea: Extroverted, bragging, a flirt, not vain, physically strong, commanding, provider, he demands respect, is quick to fight, drinks hard and is never sensitive or weak. 

On the other side, my father’s culture is less prescriptive and more ""avoidant"" of homosexuality. Anything like that is something “wrong”, something one should not do. For example: makeup, women’s clothes, some mannerisms, softness or being too close (physically or emotionally) to another man.

All of this becomes strange and kind of funny once I consider the way I fit in them. In general terms: I am quiet and not aggressive, I’m conscientious and organized, sensitive but very reserved; I’m not gay but I’ve always been single and I’m too independent and weird to be a “family guy”; I don’t have feminine mannerisms and dress like a metalhead. 

Which means: if I used my father’s culture as measurement, I would be within the masculine expectations, because I don’t have any “homosexual behaviors”. But if I used my country’s expectations, then I would be half outside, because I’m not an assertive extroverted Don Juan. Wack, isn’t it?.

To exemplify it I can tell a couple of anecdotes:

My mom once asked me if I was gay, because I don’t date and haven’t had a girlfriend, while my dad doesn’t mind that as long as I’m a responsible worker/student.

On the other hand my dad once got weird because I went to the movie theater only with one male friend, while my mom didn’t mind that because here that is not strange at all.

\---

Even here, in the internet and in hollywoodian media (the most frequent here) I notice that cultural contrast. Since many are from the U.S. I have noticed the differences in the conceptions around masculinity.

2020-09-10 06:29:21,Feel like it’s not masculine to be nice or friendly?,"I just feel a bit weird trying to be a ‘positive’ or ‘friendly’ guy. For a long time I’ve been feeling like the way I think or interact socially isn’t that masculine, compared to the other guys I know. I try to be thoughtful by getting gifts, I actively try to remember peoples names, send cheerful texts, and try to not be closed off and depressed even though that’s how I’ve felt for a while. 

..but I don’t know if it’s the people I’m surrounded by, or the city I’m in (London UK) it seems like masculinity doesn’t fit with those things. It’s more mocking, competitive, harsh, etc. 

I definitely inhibit that sometimes, but it just isn’t in my soul. Even when competing in sports, I’m so respectful and gracious that it seems to be weird or foreign. I just like being nice, I like having fun and roasting others but from a place of love. I definitely feel there needs to be a balance, I try to never allow myself to be taken advantage of and I look quite masculine, I don’t think I’m a particularly stereotypically ‘soft’ person, I’m a pretty standard guy.

Has this got anything to do with masculinity or am I making it up?",True,119,0.95,38,,/r/MensLib/comments/ipqqm3/feel_like_its_not_masculine_to_be_nice_or_friendly/,fatherly_lizard

I started dating her around 4-5 months ago. I am a non-judgement type, and after dating some really really toxic and immature people, I knew I cared more about how they treated me over ""status"". So when I saw ""Single Mom"" in her bio at first I was a little nervous, but I decided to give her a chance.  

And boy am I glad I gave her a chance. This girl is my world. She is the sweetest, most considerate, and strongest woman I have ever met. I mean, she outshines my own Mom in so many areas of character development, kindness, maturity etc. Like, she is the most mature and collected person I know, even she's she's stressed out. And she is a year younger than me. She had her world rocked in high school yet still manages to squeeze more joy out of life than most people I know.

And as for her daughter, I am blown away. I've been able to watch her grow these past months and each day I fall more and more in love with the two of them. Her daughter stood up on her own in front of me. She took her first steps towards me, and yesterday, she said her first word. I was feeding her, and she wasn't interested anymore. This little tyke looks me dead in the eye and says ""No"" while shaking her head. I sat there stunned for like 5 minutes while she smashed her banana. To put it plainly, I'm a little addicted to parenting. 

However not everyone is a non-judgement type. And it's been hard. I am a music major. I am emotional, and draw on this emotion to compose. So I've heard stuff like ""How are you going to provide as a musician?!"" or ""Wow, were you desperate or something?"", and the most common ""Oh. That's nice"" (With visibly uncomfortable body language)

It's been hard. But over time, I have realized that it isn't worth worrying about. Because people who judge you for dating a single mom... Fuck em. I don't need those kinds of people in my life.

I wouldn't trade what I have for anything else. Never in my life did I think I would be a father before my older siblings. But as the saying goes ""You make plans, and God laughs""

2020-09-07 16:24:41,Tonight I got to give the gift of crying to my friend who hasn't cried in a decade.,"I want to tell the story of how I helped my friend cry tonight but I want to give some context.

We've been friends for 20 years and we've always talked about how frustrated we both were in the ways that our friendships with men often go. We would commiserate that we didn't have enough physical contact, enough sweetness, enough vulnerability and lots of other things so we decided to move in together and be and give those things to each other.

Well it's been great, well watch shows on the couch and just have our shoulders together or drape arms over each other and it's been really really great.

I want to be clear, it's not common for big tall straight guys like us to have the opportunity to do stuff like this with other male friends. It is literally alien and unwelcome for most of the men we both know.

And tonight I got to do something I never even thought of doing in my life.

My friend is going through a really tough time and hes just been building up stress for months about this thing going on. 

We spoke about it and he mentioned he wished he could cry and told me he hadn't cried except for eyes watering for a half second in 10 years!

I asked him to put his head on my lap and I rubbed my fingers through his hair and I stroked his cheek and I told him he was safe and that I was there and protecting him and he could relax and I was taking care of him.

I remembered my mother doing this for me when I was a teenager and I'd bawl my goddamn eyes out.

After a few minutes he went quiet and then I heard him sobbing and he got up immediately and thanked me and I told him he didn't need to get up and I could see he was confused so I gently put him back in my lap and he just sobbed more for like 20 minutes and then he told me he felt better and went to take a nap in his room.

Look I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, I'm just sharing because some other guy out there right now might need to hear that were allowed to do this for each other. We are allowed to create spaces where our brothers can be safe and vulnerable.

It felt like he had been strong and protective for so long and in that space I was able to convince his body that I was protecting it, that it was safe in my arms with me on the lookout and he was safe to rest and cry.

I'm 40 years old. Ive never gotten that kind of feeling from any man, only my mother and from girlfriends, and tonight I got to give that to a man who is a brother in my heart.

I don't know if this is worthwhile as a story. I've wanted for so long to be a part of some small shift in how men are and tonight I really felt like I got to see something that felt different to how I saw men told to be.

I hope someone gets something out of this.

Goodnight brothers.

2020-09-07 23:30:33,Retrospective on the now dead Peter Pan syndrome-debate.,"I had a realisation the other day, and I'd like to test my idea with you if that's alright.

Remember how a decade back there were a lot more debates going on about men not leaving their ""childhood attributes"" and women were complaining in the media about men not growing up. Computer games were especially targeted but it could also be lots of other things, a guy keeping his Lego or figurine collections, still avidly following their media directed primarily to juvenile audiences and so forth. I guess also: sinking time into fun, but not particularly useful, activities with your male friends also accounted for this so called Peter Pan syndrome.

But then the talk suddenly died down and I think I may know the reason for it.

This was a generational thing. This was the last generation who grew up with guy and girl interests held strictly separate, where no young boy wanted to invite any girls into sharing that which he had with his male friends. Now, those interests and hobbies have evolved, and nostalgia is ever marketable, but I can see now why that snarky debate took place. There was a certain sadness behind it. Peter Pan who never invited Wendy.

At the time, I probably reacted like any not-so-thoughtful male netizen would with ""Oh yeah, but honey, you can shove your Martha Stewart crap, dinner parties and whatever ""super valid"" interests YOU have that I don't care a shit about, and I'll keep playing WoW over here..."", but that wasn't really it, was it? 

Now it has changed for the better I think. Now young boys and girls actually share interests growing up, more and more. Now it's accepted that ""You're never too old to play""(within reason). Even my office has a gaming pit. 

Still feel a bit sorry for that generation which is now what? In their 40-50s? All the excluded women, and all the men hiding away the barely tolerated stuff they love in the basement or garage.

Or that one should not run from a violent confrontation, or that a man should be a provider.

I talked about this with a friend who's a practicing psychotherapist and they pointed out that even men who don't hold on to such sentiments still display behavior that aligns with them, so instead, we tried to list off some behavioral descriptions:

-emotional stuntedness
-overt compartmentalization
-violent tendencies
-emotional or behavioral performance as opposed to genuine expression
-obsession with social status
-Strong fear of societal/social rejection or abandonment, culminating in or inspiring the behaviors described above.

I'm sure you guys could list another few, but I took a look at these and thought to myself:

2020-09-07 18:02:15,Old Friends and their apparent habbits,"I met up with some friends recently due to the last of them becoming a father recently. We all have children and wifes, I meet seem pretty seldom, at least once a year, but rarely more often.

Conversations are pretty much about trips they did, often about woman. Not their wifes, woman they hooked up with and how to hook up. I know that they are not faithful to their wifes, but that is something between them and their wifes. It seems they are ok with it, because they are not trying to hide that very good, they have to know.
  
This time the discussion was, if it would be a good idea to rent a 12 person yacht for 8k/day in order to anchor in front of a beach and get girls from the beach to the yacht by tender in order to get laid. They are six people who are going on vacation once a year together. One guy suggested, that getting prostitutes for 1,3k per person daily would be better since nobody had to relay on luck/additional cost to make the girls from the beach happy (i.e. ""We need a barkeeper to supply cocktails or something"") in order to get laid and for 1,3k you can get really pretty girls who know what they are doing and have an overall better experience then some girl from the beach. And you don't have to ask for their age.

I was pretty baffled by this conversation to say the least. I mean I knew they are not the most faithful bunch, but that kind of planning was quite the shock.
A little bit disgusted but also a little fascinated how much they seem to be needing to have sex with other woman.
Their wifes are not ugly by any standard and I can't really understand why they are doing that.

2020-09-04 11:09:23,Toward Positive Masculinity,"There have been a few posts here about positive masculinity recently, which I think is incredible and something I want to contribute to.

I have been researching this for several months and (along with help from a couple other people)  created a ""short"" definition of masculinity that fits three key areas I felt were missing for men and personally wanted:

1. Its not toxic--it actively promotes physical and mental health and does not include emotional repression, domination or other toxic qualities. I ran it by a veteran psychologist and it passed with flying colors--she also suggested I bring the definition to other psychologists.
2. It actually feels good (to me at least) and it helps with day-to-day life. Also, its based on tweaks to some of the better traits that were part of masculinity over the last hundred or so years (at some point) so, at least for me, it didn't involve any serious mental gymnastics to adopt as an identity.
3. It supports men in being strong and successful. You don't need to use it to be that way, but as someone who genuinely wants to be like this, I find this gives me a good foundation for it.

&#x200B;

# The Traits

Before we start, please bear in mind that this was written for myself and other men who want to live with agency and purpose, becoming strong, successful, capable and healthy. It isn't intended as an all or nothing platform or a something every man has to adopt. Its like an RPG, everyone has the capacity for these, and its up to you whether you want to develop them. You can leave a trait at level 1, or max it out. The traits:

**Grit and Resilience** \- This is the persistence to pursue your goals, in good times and bad. To understand that failure is an event, not an identity. This is the fortitude to weather life's storms when you can, and the maturity to accept you won't weather every storm. When you get knocked down, accept it, understand it's temporary and work to get back up. Done right, this has significant protective effects against depression and anxiety, improves quality of life and gives you a huge boost in achieving a wide range of goals.

**Pursuit of Excellence** \- (*Please keep in mind the audience it was intended for, and that this doesn't need to apply to every man*) Building a career and finding meaning dwarfs almost every other variable in predicting men's Positive Mindset Index. Increasing income (up to a point) increases life satisfaction--especially for those who weren't stoked about their lives before. Build your finances through a career or entrepreneurship--enough to live comfortably if possible. Build skill at what you do, and look for meaning in it. 

**Consistency & Commitment** \- Keep your commitments to both yourself and others. This means staying on top of what you know you need to do. With goals, you don't have to move forward fast--just try to get a little better every day. Direction matters more than speed, so keep it easy on yourself. Don't keep sliding back and making the same gains over and over.

**Strength & Health** \- Exercise, both with cardio and resistance work. It is hugely important for your health (it can add 6+ years to your life). Eat healthy and take care of any issues that come up. This means going to see a doctor or psychologist when you need to--doing this means you were smart enough to take effective action.

**Goal Oriented, Process Focused** \- Know where you're going, but live in the moment. Treat it like an RPG--you know what your goals are and the actions you need to take to get there. Accept where you're at, what you have the skill to do and look to level up the skills you need. As you do it, be fully present in the actions you take, rather than dwelling on what your future might look like once you get there. Some of life is going to be fun and exciting, sometimes you'll have to grind, but it is worth it for where you're going.

**Build Brotherhood** \- Life is meant to be shared with others--both its highs and its lows--and not just with an SO. Social connection is one of the most enriching parts of life and plays an incredibly important role in health. Connect with other men, be open, authentic and honest. Don't be afraid to ask for (or give) support when you (or they) need it.

# Scientific Basis

**Grit and Resilience**

Grit is associated with lower anxiety and depression ([1a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6294431/),[2a](https://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-11182015-210720/unrestricted/Zhu,Joyce.pdf), [3a](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6210347/)) and increase in the meaning found in life, with the two factors combining to lower the risk of suicide ([4a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0092656613000597)).

Work by Angela Duckworth and others linked grit goal-oriented success in substantially different venues, from the military ([5a](https://www.pnas.org/content/116/47/23499)) to school ([6a](https://www.earth.com/news/grit-academic-success/)). However, a meta-analysis ([7a](http://www.ippanetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/MuchAdoAboutGrit.pdf)) found that this work may have been overzealous. While grit does show an improvement in outcomes, one sub-component matters substantially more than the other--perseverance is very valuable, passion not as much.

However, we believe that being excited and personally driven to reach your goals also matters. Masculinity shouldn't be stressful or a slog you are doing because you have to. The goal is for men to find a purpose in life that truly matters and ties in with your identity (*Atomic Habits* James Clear).

Resilience is often correlated with grit, though the two are distinct. Like grit, it is extremely good for mental health, lowering the incidence of depression and anxiety significantly ([8a](https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/5223sed5332), [9a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953620304809), [10a](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272381543_A_meta-analysis_of_the_trait_resilience_and_mental_health), [11a](https://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/archive/article/200713/The-association-between-resilience-and-mental-health-in-the-somatically-ill-a-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis)). It is worth noting that there is more than one specific clinical definition of resilience, but the underlying idea is, to paraphrase an APA definition, the ability to bounce back from negative events.

&#x200B;

**Pursuit of Excellence**

A large study sponsored by Harry's razors looked at what traits were important to PMI, a blended measure of ""happiness, confidence, sense of being in control, emotional stability, motivation and optimism"". They found satisfying employment, as defined by one's ability to make an impact on the outcome of the company they work for, was extremely important, dwarfing all other variables (including health, income and being married) in size--it was almost 4x as large as anything else ([1b](https://s3.amazonaws.com/harrys-cdnx-prod/manual/Harry%27s+Masculinity+Report%2C+USA+2018.pdf)). Income is also the largest determinant of life satisfaction and people predict their lives will be more meaningful if they earn more money ([2b](https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2016/HR-V1_web.pdf), [3b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2944762/), [4b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-005-3107-0)).

Higher income is linked to good physical health ([5b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088996/)), [6b](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2126895/)) and mental health, including anxiety and depression ([7b](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110404161716.htm), [8b](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21464366/)).

Meaning or purpose in life is extremely important. A Templeton Institute review showed those with purpose have more optimism, hope, self-esteem, self-efficacy and life satisfaction, improved grit and resilience over those who do not have purpose. ([5b](https://www.templeton.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Psychology-of-Purpose.pdf)). People with purpose also have better physical health and subjective well-being ([6b](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28488471/), [7b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-020-00230-y)).

&#x200B;

**Consistency & Commitment**

This is basically the development of conscientiousness. It is useful in two ways: first, from a logical perspective, it keeps you from backsliding in your goal pursuit. This means the perseverance from Grit & Resilience doesn't just keep you covering the same ground all the time--you actually make progress.

Also, while the effects of conscientiousness are small, they are wide ranging and almost universally positive. It is correlated with a lower incidence of all health-risk behaviors studied ([1c](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15535742/)), higher life satisfaction ([2c](https://web.archive.org/web/20190214201913/http://www.subjectpool.com/ed_teach/y4person/3_happiness/Steel2008_5FM_and_happiness_psych_bull.pdf)) and lower depression ([3c](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4605994/)), among many other benefits. Of note, it also ameliorates the negative health effects of neuroticism ([4c](https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/news/story/being-neurotic-conscientious-a-good-combo-for-health)), meaning those who are easily stressed, worried and bent out of shape will have considerably better health if they are contentious.

&#x200B;

**Strength & Health**

The effect of exercise on physical health is well known, and there's good reason to do it. For example, those who run an optimal amount (more isn't always better) live about 6 years longer than those who don't run ([1d](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6139866/)). Muscle strength can help protect against an early death. One study noted the weakest group was some 50% more likely to die early ([2d](https://news.umich.edu/people-with-low-muscle-strength-more-likely-to-die-prematurely/)). While the physical health effect is huge, there is also a small, but consistently positive, effect on mental health ([3d](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00081/full)).

Maintaining muscle mass is also important for older individuals ([9d](https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/news/20110708/older-people-must-work-out-more-to-keep-muscles#1),[10d](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/preserve-your-muscle-mass)).

When it comes to getting help, we have heard a lot about traditional masculine norms against this, and indeed literature reviews suggest traditional masculinity may indeed impact men's help-seeking ([11d](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17437199.2013.840954), [12d](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/cou-cou0000176.pdf)) through a rigid focus on self-sufficiency and embarrassment around asking for help or not being seen as healthy, physically or psychologically.

Clearly, this needs to change. Men should be supported, rather than criticized, for going to a doctor or psychologist. It is better to see a doctor about what you consider a minor, nagging, issue than to skip it because it's ""not that bad"". Many issues are much easier to treat when caught early.

&#x200B;

**Goal Oriented, Process Focused**

The idea here largely follows research from James Clear's *Atomic Habits*, which relies on work done by Charles Duhigg's *The Power of Habit*. The science in these has been confirmed as accurate by psychologists and is well regarded. It should help keep one from burning out in pursuit of goals, and hopefully be able to enjoy the process. Following the process should be a net gain and enjoyable along the way.

We took the RPG idea in part from Stick RPG (not linking to this because it runs on Flash) and from Nerd Fitness ([site](https://www.nerdfitness.com/blog/game-of-life/)). We believe it fits in well with the research in the above books and provides a well known framework for reasonable progression toward goals.

&#x200B;

**Build Brotherhood**

It is well known by now that loneliness is a major factor in all-cause mortality ([1f](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5754055/)). However, as the study also notes, men are hit harder by loneliness than women. Women tend to have closer friendships than men according to cultural stereotypes we see, and some data suggest this is the case ([2f](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1766&context=etd)). However, it is far from an inborn trait: many older western societies celebrated closeness among men ([3f](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/the-history-and-nature-of-man-friendships/)).

Close friendships improve your sense of belonging and purpose, your mental health, memory and physical health. It can also reduce stress and make you happier and more resilient ([4f](https://www.southernliving.com/healthy-living/study-shows-better-health-linked-good-friendships), [5f](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/in-depth/friendships/art-20044860)). To put it bluntly, if you want to live a healthy, happy life, close friendships with other men are extremely valuable.",True,46,0.9,21,,/r/MensLib/comments/im87p8/toward_positive_masculinity/,FM4M
2020-09-04 05:32:04,I came across a post in r/raisedbynarcissists by a man who just had what must have been a devastating argument with his parents.,"I don't know who this person is, or anything about the dispute beyond what he provides, but I was really impressed with both [the letter he sent](https://np.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/im0k6e/ive_cut_off_my_parents_i_cant_deal_with_it_any/g3w5dq8/) to his mother afterward, as well as [the letter he didn't send](https://np.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/im0k6e/ive_cut_off_my_parents_i_cant_deal_with_it_any/g3w6gp3/). 

I think he really managed to thread the needle in the former, accepting responsibility for his role in whatever happened while pointing out that he's not the only one in the wrong. In the letter he didn't send, he still accepts some responsibility for his own actions, but presents a damning indictment of the way he's been treated as a boy and a man. He manages to sound mostly calm and reasonable throughout, but he only seemed to really let his anger show when he talked about the way his parents treated his wife.

I think these letters are a good example of a man acknowledging and expressing his emotions to people who have never accepted the validity of his feelings or allowed him to speak his heart and mind.",True,97,1.0,14,,/r/MensLib/comments/im2q3f/i_came_across_a_post_in_rraisedbynarcissists_by_a/,asura-emulator

2020-09-02 06:32:34,So you want to be a man...,"The following was one of my favorite films as a child and it's heartwarming, uplifting, and yet still accommodating to some terrible assumptions of what being ""masculine"" means.[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZslyHY4quQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZslyHY4quQ)

Modern (as-in the 20th century) masculinity makes assumptions about being human and being masculine that are both significant contrasts to prior centuries and yet also converges neatly with other \[incorrect\] presumptions of acceptable behavior. According to misogynistic rules, it's not that men should be one way or another to the standard rules, it's that there are things they cannot be and there are things that they have extreme leeway over.

The ""Modern Man"" was allowed to be both a Mad Man (e.g. like the tv show) and a rough and ready Lumberjack. The error bars for behavior in both directions were egregiously large for men, where they could be allowed utterly primitive behavior in one situation and lack thereof in others. The common denominator to all of this behavior was that it could never be ""soft"" or ""pleasant."" You could love someone, but it had to either be with remote detachment or an animalistic fury. You could hate another, but again it had to follow a schema that could never be classified as ""subdued"" or ""subservient."" In contrast, the presumed archetypal woman had to be subservient to men and could never exhibit anything that might be mistaken as primitive or improper. There were no error bars allowed. This toxic combination of internal and external divisions served to create what is today the worst possible examples for ""how to be a man."" Which is to say, it gives men the privilege to be violently controlling cavemen and no recourse for change.

So how does one escape this behavior? How does one teach children how to avoid it? The latter is a lot easier than the former, and also helps to inform ways to relearn how to exist in a healthy way. Most importantly, ""how to be a man"" should be re-titled ""how to be a human being,"" because there should be no functional difference between sex or gender in what a healthy baseline should be.

A baseline, post-modern human should:

* Know that you are human, and so is your neighbor.
* Understand that fear exists for a reason, but should not rule your life.
   * Fear of things in the world means you don't understand them and need to take time to assess how you need to interact with them (if at all). It's a tool to help keep you from running ahead of your ability to process the world, not a justification to avoid or harm things.
* Be able to adapt to new situations.
   * You should not be so strict in your behavior that you can't navigate social situations as necessary. One group may want you to always interrupt and speak your mind. Another may have rules about how to speak. Both or neither may be fair or unfair, and there are even necessary adaptations for how to modify unfair rules such that everyone can say their peace.
   * What's most important is that you walk into every situation understanding that you aren't the only face in the room, but nor are you singularly unimportant to it either.
   * As you learn new things, if they have sound logic, you should incorporate them into your life. Just because you like a habit, doesn't mean it's the best one to keep.
* Put the work in.
   * You cannot succeed at being manly/womanly/whatever if you don't put sufficient time and effort into what you're doing. This doesn't mean every endeavor requires completion or perfection, but rather you should make sure you put the time into the things you want done and not pretend that 1000 abandoned projects equal one completed one.
* Believe that smart is sexy, but arrogance is not.
   * What this means is that you should be well-read, willing to learn more, a healthy skeptic, and willing to impart what you know in a way that shows you understand you and the people you're talking to are still human. Ask them how best to talk about a subject if it appears there's miscommunication instead of trying to force it in a language or mode where miscommunication will continue.
* Physical health should never be stylistic and always follow up to date and well-vetted scientific understanding.
   * Fad diets and exercise regimens regularly appear and disappear, up to and including bringing back old beliefs as if they're ""ancient secrets."" Instead of trying to go for quick fixes or secret methods, just know that keeping up with your physical health is important, necessary, and an everyday habit. The manliest man and womanliest woman both have the same secret, they just put the physical exertion and self-control in to stay healthy.
   * Don't ignore diagnostics just because they might be embarrassing. Breast, colon, etc. exams are necessary things to your physical health.
   * While you shouldn't be so clean as to live in a bubble, maintain your space and body so that it doesn't deteriorate.
* Care first and foremost about utility/functionality and add spice and style on top of it.
   * Your personal health and wellness should always be more important than style or unnecessary features.
   * You're allowed to reject an unhealthy style and call it out for what it is. Just because it looks good  or everyone else does it doesn't mean it's good for you. This includes things that a traditional culture may adhere to, including hair styles, body modification, and other behaviors/changes that you're concerned about.
      * Shaving anything (face, arms, legs, etc) should do no, insignificant, or less harm than not shaving. In an era of wearing facemasks, shaving one's face can be important to the health of those around you. In an era of ever increasing waste, not shaving parts of one's body can be important (to personal health and to the environment).
      * Don't stick to a style if it will be dangerous in the short run. Long hair/beards or nails near machinery is a recipe for disaster. Certain plastic polymers in clothing should never be used near high heat. Clothing that fits too tightly or loosely should be avoided so you don't harm yourself (e.g. skinny jeans/blood flow restrictions or hanging chains/getting caught on random objects).
   * If someone's extremely utilitarian, but still not in an unhealthy way, their lack of fashion is not a crime. Some of the most ridiculous things one can wear are also the healthiest depending on the environment.
      * On top of a mountain or near large bodies of water, sunscreen may make you look idiotic, but having giant chunks of your face/body removed due to malignant melanoma shows actual idiocy.
* Understand that self-sufficiency and community assistance are two sides to the same coin.
   * Don't be embarrassed to admit your ignorance and ask for help. If you don't know how to administer your own breast exam, talk to your doctor, a partner, or someone else who knows and can help. If you don't know what a healthy diet is, take the time to learn from health professionals. The same goes for home repair and clothing repair.
* Be kind.
   * Not nice, not useful, not just not bad...be kind. Help where you can and be empathetic while doing so. This doesn't mean you have to perfectly emulate Fred Rogers, but rather that you should be an overall positive force in your community. You can have a dark sense of humor and still be a kind person (in fact, this may be necessary for some cases of kindness), just remember that it should be adapted to the right time and place.",True,57,0.88,9,,/r/MensLib/comments/ikuj9c/so_you_want_to_be_a_man/,SOL-Cantus

2020-08-31 04:18:33,Quality sex and relationship ed is not a pipe dream - a positive thread ?,"I've read some discussions on this sub lately about men's dating woes. There are quite a few testimonies here about men internalizing guilt about their sexuality because they were given more warnings about what NOT to do than positive examples of what they COULD do. Often because they were lacking role models in their lives and they had to resort to fictional tropes or dodgy and contradictory online resources. 


I personally am one of those guys, and back in my days in high school, the school curriculum didn't go a lot further than biology stuff and extensive talks on how to prevent STDs and pregnancies. Not much about relationships except maybe some talk about LGBT tolerance, because in my country gay marriage was a hot button topic back then. This was the early 2000s in a relatively progressive Western country. 


I was looking something up and then I stumbled on a website for educators on high school sex ed. It linked to a resource that they recommended, a website made by Sensoa (a Flemish government funded sexual health organization). 


What struck me was how they talked about positive stuff and how to take initiative, as well as negative stuff and how to set boundaries. Just the thing many guys on here ask for. It was very much in contrast with a resource I'd seen from a North American organization, which had extensive content about consent and plenty of examples warning against sexist behavior, harassment etc. but little to nothing about how to initiate in a healthy way - making it feel rather like a sermon. 


Reading the North American resource made me feel like it would scare off (conscientious) teen boys more than Evangelical talk about abstinence, while the Belgian source seemed more balanced because it tackles both consent issues as well as positive ways of making your interest known to someone, how to approach in a respectful way, read and emit body language etc. 


Some examples:

2020-08-29 12:37:34,Positive masculinity has to be more than oppositional.,"To preface this, what I'm saying is an opinion based on my experience and research. My primary area of expertise is in looking at how people communicate.


There are countless examples of toxic masculinity. Of behaviors and expectations that are causing harm to people. This makes it easy to define a healthy version of masculinity by comparison. To define health by the absence of harm. I strongly believe we shouldn't do that. That while it may be progress, it's not the goal we should be aiming for, the vision of a future we should be believing in.


Let us look for instance, at toxic expectations around emotional vulnerability. The expectation is to suffer in silence. There are a whole bunch of really negative implications to this. Things like how emotional pain from men isn't treated seriously. How men shouldn't offer emotional support, shouldn't learn skills to improve at doing emotional labor. There can be prejudice in fields where emotional labor is required. There's a lot wrong there. But the thing that an oppositional stance misses is that what gives it relevance is that there are some healthy pieces of masculinity that are being co-opted. Speaking as someone that has spent a large chunk of my life dealing with chronic pain, this concept of masculine endurance/persistence has been profoundly helpful. Sometimes the world is just awful, and in order to keep living you have to put one foot in front of the other. To refine this concept: the ability to put your best foot forward regardless of personal circumstance.


Already I can hear the responses about how that too can be negatively applied. And my response to this criticism is very simple: yes, you're right, and that's the point. Enduring pain can be negative if you neglect your health. But sometimes even doing everything right you are still in pain, and you still need to do things. The point is that there are positive, constructive things that can be built off of the premises of toxic masculinity.


But if you don't look that deeply at it, you cede that ground. You reinforce the idea that this persistence belongs in a negatively connotated box. You reinforce that toxic masculinity owns it. I will tell you truly, toxic masculinity is a pretender and a thief, and has no right to any of what it has appropriated for its own uses. When you define in opposition to it, you affirm it's right to what it has stolen from us.



TLDR;

Don't build a mirror. Slaughter the giant and make a garden from it's corpse.

2020-08-28 15:45:40,An Interesting Quote,"From bell hooks' The Will To Change -

>""To heal, men must learn to feel again. They must learn to break the silence, to speak the pain. Often men, to speak the pain, first turn to the women in their lives and are refused a hearing. In many way women have bought into the patriarchal masculine mystique. Asked to witness a male expressing feelings, to listen to those feelings and respond, they may simply turn away. There was a time when I would often ask the man in my life to tell me his feelings. And yet when he began to speak, I would either interrupt or silence him by crying, sending him the message that his feelings were too heavy for anyone to bear, so it was best if he kept them to himself. As the Sylvia cartoon I have previously mentioned reminds us, women are fearful of hearing men voice feelings. I did not want to hear the pain of my male partner because hearing it required that I surrender my investment in the patriarchal ideal of the male as protector of the wounded. If he was wounded, then how could he protect me?

>As I matured, as my feminist consciousness developed to include the recognition of patriarchal abuse of men, I could hear male pain. I could see men as comrades and fellow travelers on the journey of life and not as existing merely to provide instrumental support. Since men have yet to organize a feminist men’s movement that would proclaim the rights of men to emotional awareness and expression*, we will not know how many men have indeed tried to express feelings, only to have the women in their lives tune out or be turned off. Talking with men, I have been stunned when individual males would confess to sharing intense feelings with a male buddy, only to have that buddy either interrupt to silence the sharing, offer no response, or distance himself. Men of all ages who want to talk about feelings usually learn not to go to other men.""

Do any of you have direct experience with being told to be quiet when expressing your feelings?  What are the ways you've been silenced by patriarchal expectations?",True,1037,0.99,221,,/r/MensLib/comments/ii2wyu/an_interesting_quote/,Uniquenameofuser1
2020-08-29 00:30:45,Shame and Boys Crying,"I was listening to an episode of Psychology In Seattle recently and [the topic of men not crying](https://youtu.be/eDwsN4hN6cg?t=866) and how that starts  came up. One host described his father being angry at him and explicitly telling him not to cry. The other host recalled that around the age of 5-7 years old he started to notice that you weren't supposed to cry and that many boys his age didn't cry at all and feeling like the ones who didn't were so tough and cool. He continued with another experience on feeling shame the sixth grade from crying from an shocking experience during a game of baseball.


Those experience struck me really hard and I had a similar experience of first having the observation that I was crying and that the rest of the kids and especially the cool kids weren't.
In preschool I never cried, but then in kindergarten, when things started to get bad at home, I cried a few times that year and I felt so judged for it that I told myself I could only do it once a year from then on. And later on in fourth grade me and my friends had a prank go wrong and the principle who was observing the room came and split us up yelled at us on at time and until we were all crying in front of our class and I still have the memory of thinking to myself I will never cry in front of people again. 

Shame, both external and internalized, about crying seems to be fairly universal experience for anyone who was raised male that happens pretty young. I'm curious about the rest of y'all was there a crucial moment in childhood where you decided that you had to stop crying?

Maybe it is subtle. It seemed that the boys and girls in my class were treated in more or less of an equal way.

I know that there's still a stigma on men wearing feminine attire. I've attempted to dress androgynously and got scorn, but not from anyone on the streets but from my own parents.

I feel this double standard exists as I know my female cousins buy clothes from the boys section and their parents allow it but would think the same if my male cousins wanted to dress androgynously.

2020-08-28 20:42:07,A research paper on teacher bias and gender education gap,"I came across a [recent research paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2020.101981) which I thought this sub might find interesting. The paper studies teachers' biases in grading, and their impact on students' achievement; the paper itself is paywalled, but there's an [older, freely available report](http://seii.mit.edu/research/study/boys-lag-behind-how-teachers-gender-biases-affect-student-achievement/) apparently covering the same research. 

The author tracks the progress of about 4500 French kids through the four years of middle school, which starts at grade 6, or about 11 years of age. She looks at the grades in two subjects, French and math, comparing the in-class grades assigned by the teachers with ""blind"" grades attained in standardised tests, which are graded by external evaluators without knowledge of the students' genders. She defines a teacher's ""gender bias"" as the difference between the gender gap in the in-class scores and the gender gap in the blind scores achieved by the teacher's class. She then tracks the same group of students for two more years past middle school, to see what (if any) high school track they choose. Here are some of her findings:

* There is a significant overall girl-favoring bias in math grades. Indeed, by grade 6, boys outperform girls in the blind tests, but lag behind in the in-class grades; by grade 9, boys also lag behind in blind scores.

* On the other hand, there is no detected overall bias in French; that is, teachers of French are biased as well, but they tend to have girl-favoring biases about as often as boy-favoring ones (as the author points out, this contrasts with some earlier papers that found girl-favoring biases across all subjects). 

* Both in math and in French, the bias of a student's teacher in grade 6 has a statistically significant impact on the student's progress through middle school (here ""progress"" is defined as the difference between the blind score in grade 9 and the blind score in grade 6). 

* A favorable teacher bias in grade 6 in math also makes the student more likely to choose a science track at high school five years later. Since science track at high school tends to be male-dominated, this means that the middle school math teachers' bias makes the gender ratio at high school science track more balanced.

* Male teachers seem to exhibit about the same overall bias as female teachers. In fact, in math (where about half of the teachers are male), male teachers show a slightly larger girl-favoring bias than female teachers, but the difference is too small to be statistically significant. In French (where 85% of teachers are female), teacher gender seems to have no effect on bias. (Again, this contrasts with some other papers that found teacher gender to be significant.)

The data for the research were mostly collected in Créteil, a Paris suburb which the author describes as ""deprived area"". As such, the findings are not necessarily representative of the whole of France, or even of other countries. 

What do you think about these findings? Do they match your expectations? And do you think that a girl-favoring grading bias can be justified by the aim of balancing the gender ratio in science?",True,64,0.9,15,,/r/MensLib/comments/ii6bks/a_research_paper_on_teacher_bias_and_gender/,vtj

2020-08-27 18:58:03,Correcting a common misconception about venting and mental health,"This has come up multiple times in this subreddit now: the misconception that it's psychology healthy for people to vent (in particular, venting [misdirected](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/i0bxso/actual_legit_challenges_for_dating_as_a_guy/fzp4v1m/?context=3) frustration at women for men's dating struggles). Not only is this [problematic](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/igbrho/lets_talk_about_how_men_should_set_healthy/g2ueld3/?context=3) in that it contributes to misogyny and thus [rape culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture) (hence, being counterproductive to the stated desire that women initiate more) but it's also psychologically unhealthy for those that engage. 

There is an excellent podcast called [The Happiness Lab](https://www.happinesslab.fm/), produced by Yale professor Dr. Laurie Santos, which I highly recommend listening to from the beginning, especially if you feel your mental health is not quite what you'd like it to be. However, **I'd also like to specifically share [Episode 2](https://www.happinesslab.fm/season-2-episodes/episode-2-pj-and-alex-love-to-gripe) from the most recent season, which is entirely about venting and how it's actually not psychologically beneficial for the person venting**. You can also just download from wherever you get your podcasts. 

This comes up often enough, and is damaging enough, that I thought it deserved its own post.

ETA: Please actually listen to the podcast before commenting. Most of the comments here seem to be simply reiterating the common assumptions that the science refutes, as discussed in the podcast.    
ETA2: Really, the whole thing all the through is useful. In the first half they interview two regular guys who love to gripe, in the second half they interview a scientist about the years of research showing why their assumptions are wrong.

2020-08-26 22:38:35,Men need to feel safe too. I've rarely felt 'taken care of' on a date.,"We always hear about how the guy has to wine and dine the woman he's with on a date, and make her feel comfortable.

Where the heck is any of that for the guy?

I understand the importance of making a woman feel safe on a date, but how come it's not expected for them to help a guy feel comfortable either?

It feels always expected that I will just be able to get turned on right away and that just isnt true.

I need to feel emotionally safe with a woman before she really turns me on. That's just how it is.

I'd love for a woman to slowly guide me through the sex stuff. To make me feel safe, for a change.

As someone who doesnt have a ton of sexual experience, that would be such a turn on. 

Instead, it feels like it is solely up to me to initiate every damn thing, and frankly...I am tired of it.

Yes, I am all for making a woman feel safe, sexy, and comfortable, but I feel like so many women are not expected to treat guys in the same way. At least not at first.

It's maddening.

I deserve to feel safe too.

*EDIT*- I made a mistake equating the emotional safety of a guy with the physical safety of a woman. They arent on the same level. Women have way more to fear. My language did not make that clear. Moreso, I have started to understand that I have potentially been dating with the wrong mindset. As a highly sensitive male, dating is a ritual that easily tires me out.

To also feel shafted because I dont live up to some masculine expectation is not fun. Yet, I also recognize that dating is not really easy for a lot of people, and that I have made some insensitive comments to some of the people responding to this post.

While my original post had validity, I also feel tired for the women who have had to carry the emotional labor of various men throughout their life.

2020-08-27 11:07:08,Male Body Standards,"I'm a woman, and I've been meaning to write out my thoughts about this for a while. This sub seems like a good place? If not, the moderators can just take me down, I guess.

Anyway, I consume a lot of media, just like your average Gen Z-er, from any era that I can get my hands on. Movies, TV shows, books, etc. And something I've noticed is that in recent years, women in media have become less and less objectified (which is nice, obviously), but it almost feels like for men the process is going in reverse. Male bodies in media (especially movies and TV) are being held to a higher and more ridiculous standard than they were before, unlike female bodies. 

A couple of examples to show you what I mean:

In the original 60s *Star Trek*, captain Kirk was meant to be something of a heartthrob for the women in the audience, and he spends quite a bit of time with his shirt just about torn off of his body. A quick google search of ""captain Kirk shirtless"" [will show you what I'm talking about](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/shirtless-william-shatner-as-captain-james-t-kirk-in-the-news-photo/145281155). William Shatner is a handsome guy, and he was obviously well built. He has fairly defined pecs and quite strong abdominal muscles. He seems healthy.

Now, let's talk about...oh...I don't know...any recent Marvel movie, for instance. In any superhero movie with a male lead, you are almost guaranteed at least 30 seconds of screen time dedicated to showing off that lead's rippling muscles. There's [Guardians of the Galaxy](https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Chris-Pratt-Guardians-Galaxy-GIFs-41662922), [Thor](https://www.towleroad.com/2017/10/chris-hemsworth-shirtless-2/), [Spider-man](https://www.vulture.com/2017/04/the-marvel-movies-shirtless-scenes-will-continue.html), yada yada. You get it.

What a lot of people don't seem to know about the kind of muscular definition that these men have in Marvel movies is that you have to be dehydrated and on a very special diet to look like that. Being able to see each individual abdominal muscle is not something normal, and most likely it's not healthy. This is the kind of thing that bodybuilders do before competitions, not what anyone should look like in their day-to-day lives.

It honestly seems to me that if you laid out every movie/TV heartthrob on a chronological timeline, it would just look like a sliding scale from ""muscular"" to ""impossible."" 

Does anyone have any thoughts on why this is? Are there any men who feel like this has had an effect on them? Am I wrong about this? I'm curious to know.",True,129,0.95,132,,/r/MensLib/comments/ihde2h/male_body_standards/,Lovelyandstupid

So I came out of a serious relationship a few months ago. It was the first time I was in a relationship with a woman where we'd discussed marriage and she'd met my parents and I met hers. It ended just before corona started and lockdown gave me the chance to evaluate and process its ending a bit more. The break-up was mutual, it just wasn't working.

One thing I reflected on was my lack of jealousy. I remember being constantly asked by my girlfriend about jealousy and why I didn't feel it. She'd say that me not feeling jealous of another man flirted with her or her flirting with another men was hurtful. I simply couldn't get my head around it though. I hate the language of ""she's mine/he's mine"" as there's no ownership element in a relationship and I'd always say that but it would spark more arguments. If I fully trust someone, why would I be jealous? I consider jealousy to be a negative trait so why is it indulged? Even a friend of mine recently told me it was something I should've felt more. A woman I would be with would be a fully grown woman who'd have agency and is capable of making her own decisions. I trust her so why would I need to be jealous?

A big issue that I had with it and with other similar discussions, is in how we still play into the gendered expectation of the guy being the initiator(we're talking about dating between men & women, generally). It's almost always about how the guys should become better at it. In our case, we try to find a non toxic way to do it. Now, there might be a lot of good reasons for us to frame the discussion in this way. What's problematic, are what we unwittingly enforce while doing so.   
One tragic thing that I see in a lot of guys(and in me as well, from time to time) are that these expectations start to twist and distort anything that they touch; so much so that things like personal boundaries, vulnerabilities, emotional needs, are compromised or broken—when they get in the way of a guys ability to ""perform"". We don't only see this in dating and not just with men, but it's particularly severe in dating and romance. 

The best thing we could do, if we wish to fix this, are societal reforms, that'll take a while. Meanwhile, if we want to help guys out right now, I think we could do a specific thing: Let's teach men how to set personal boundaries and healthy expectations of their partners, **before** we teach them how to become more attractive men. I honestly think that this is something that we just assume that most guys already have, but that's not my lived experience, specially when it comes to how they let women treat them. Once again, the best thing would be for us to teach people to act right. Small steps for now.

I try to live this as much as I can. It has been overall liberating, it has come with some drama as well, I have to admit.

2020-08-24 19:08:03,"""Why Nice Guys Finish Last""","One of my favorite finds since hanging out in Men's Lib has been the essay ""Why Nice Guys Finish Last"" (link below) by Julia Serano.  I've seen it linked in comments a few times,  but I didn't see a standalone post devoted to it. 

https://www.geneseo.edu/sites/default/files/sites/health/2008_Serano_Why_Nice.pdf

Serano is a trans woman who examines the ""predator/prey"" mindsets and metaphors that inform our sexual politics, and how gender interacts and is influenced by those metaphors.   As a transwoman, she's seen a bit of this from either side of the gender divide.   

As a man who's been sexually assaulted by numerous women,  I find her perspective on how society views sexual assault of males differently than that of women to be particularly noteworthy.  And I've found that trans men have been among the most sympathetic to complaints of my own treatment at times. 

She also examines the double bind that many men feel they're placed in, both being expected to be aggressive,  but entirely sensitive at the same time. 

Has anyone else read it?  Anything that stands out for anyone else?  Do any of you feel there's any truth to ""Why Nice Guys Finish Last""? Is there enough in there to foster a full discussion?

Edit - a few people in the comments have indicated they're responding without having read the essay.

2020-08-24 23:02:13,Testosterone and Aggression Causality,"One of the arguments often used to explain and excuse problematic male aggression and violence is biological.  It is claimed, ""Men are just wired that way!""  ""Testosterone is a helluva drug...""

I just saw a post in TIL that reminded me about this:

[TIL if a beta male mandrill wins a fight, it physically transforms into an alpha male over time - gaining larger testicles, skin coloration, and the ability to produce offspring](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ifoqk0/til_if_a_beta_male_mandrill_wins_a_fight_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

Many of you may already know this, but I think it bears repeating.  For humans, there is more evidence that it is actually the *behaviors* that cause increased testosterone, not the other way around.

Here's another link with some research:

[https://www.warandgender.com/wgmaleag.htm](https://www.warandgender.com/wgmaleag.htm)

I think, for me, one of the implications of this idea is that it puts us in the drivers seat.  We can be in control our behaviors.  They can be shaped, learned and unlearned.  We are not mindless apes driven to dominate by our hormones.  ""Men are just naturally that way"" is not a valid excuse.",True,62,0.9,32,,/r/MensLib/comments/ifqn3r/testosterone_and_aggression_causality/,UncleShags

2020-08-24 02:26:20,"Hetero Non dominant/Sub men, how do you deal with living in a society that is seeing a resurgence/strengthening of masculine norms?","I want to know how non masculine men here deal with the ever creeping resurgence of hypermasculine ideal that is becoming quite popular in places like the Anglosphere as a result of the rise of patriarchial reactionary right wing WASP culture, the popularity of hypermasculinity worship in our youth culture, and heterosexual dating?

Personally Ive been struggling with sexual and emotional repression for half my life as a sensitive slightly submissive man and its been quite taxing on my mental health. I live in one of the most conservative Anglo cultures when it comes to rigid  masculinity and the worship of trad masculine ideals(Australia). 

I think we will need to wait another 50 years for male liberation because of how entrenched and lauded those ideals have become by most people of both side of the ideological spectrum. It seems like different expressions of masculinity is only tolerated among the LGBT community here. Heterosexual masculinity hasnt changed much since the 80s, with the exception of homophobia and sexism becoming much more frowned upon. 

As a relatively young guy(25), Ive witnessed rigid masculine norms being reinforced by successive waves of male youth cultural movements that I thought would have been out of vogue by the time I reached my mid 20s,  but which seems to be gaining more steam with gen Z dudes. And empowered feminist women I know pedestalise the dominant masculine ideal in their dating lives, which puts men in a narrow box when it comes to desirable behaviour whilst paying lip service to the menslib cause. The workplace is hostile to men who dont toe the line. Masculine, assertive and ultra competitive  men,   are still seen as the model employee. 


 Ive given up on the idea of mens liberation. I dont think Ill see it in my lifetime and now I want to know how make the best of a shitty situation. 

 So I ask this to the older dudes who werent naturally masculine and similarly detested narrow masculinity and sexual roles in their public and private lives, how did you deal with a repressive situation for so long without succumbing to bitterness?

2020-08-22 21:08:21,Dealing with predatory behavior in other men,"Hi everyone,

I had an experience today that is making me think a lot, and I would like to discuss it with you. My wife was window shopping and I was walking with her, mostly watching people on this busy shopping street where we live. I noticed this guy who was walking up to women, talking to them and walking next to them while they were clearly showing no interest and saying no. I saw it happen a few times to make sure I was not misunderstanding the situation until I decided to step in. I walked in between him and the woman he was currently following and told him to stop harassing and following women that are clearly telling him no. His response was ""No, it's natural for men to pursue their sexual needs"" to which I told him ""Not like that. I've already seen you harass several women and if you continue this behavior I will have to call the police"". After that I walked away as I did not want to expose my wife to it any longer, but I kept an eye on him until he disappeared into the crowd.

Obviously this was an extremely problematic guy. He couldn't have been older than his early twenties and he did not seem to understand how his behavior was an issue. It makes me angry and scared as these are the kind of misguided people that will most likely end up in the wrong crowd and be indoctrinated into such bullshit as the incel ""community"".

I am glad I stepped in, but I keep worrying it may not have been enough. How can one deal with such a situation? Is there any advice on how I could've handled this better? I feel that in the end, he was just a misguided kid. It does not excuse the behavior in any way, but I wonder if someone like that can still be helped.

2020-08-21 00:57:55,Can we change one of the questions on the Adverse Childhood Experience (ACE) test?,"If you don't know what that is, it's ten question test used to gage how someone's childhood experience is. You can get a score of 0 to 10. 10 being the worst, 0 being the best. You can take the test here but be warned because the questions are quite grisly.

[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/02/387007941/take-the-ace-quiz-and-learn-what-it-does-and-doesnt-mean#:\~:text=Laura%20Starecheski,risk%20for%20later%20health%20problems.](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2015/03/02/387007941/take-the-ace-quiz-and-learn-what-it-does-and-doesnt-mean#:~:text=Laura%20Starecheski,risk%20for%20later%20health%20problems.)

But why I want to change one question is that it asks if you've ever seen your mother being treated violently, but not father/ enby parent, so if we could get them to change it to parent, then that would be good.

Also I got a score of 8, and I've very interested to hear other people's scores so if you do end up taking the test, please tell me your score (if you are okay with that)

Edit: Okay so this is to all the people surprised and apologizing that I got such a high score. Basically I hate a very abusive dad who abused (physically and emotionally) me, and my mom and sister infront of me. The rest of my family enabled him, and said that I deserved to be abused. Additionally, I was sexually assaulted twice when I was very young, and I was told not to talk about it because ""no-one wants to marry a girl who was sexually assaulted"" My mother and father divorced, and she had to leave me with him because she didn't have a house of her own, so I went a long time without seeing my mom, while my dad would bad mouth her constantly. Between all this, my brother (who lived with us) was an alcoholic. Additionally, I was being bullied at school and  my extended family would bully or ignore me for being poor. I was extremely suicidal for three years.

So how am I now?

I'm amazing! That is an understatement! I moved to another school, one that was much nicer and I made friends with everyone in my class, they all love and respect me. I did well at school and have continued to do well, I just graduated high school with great grades and got accepted to two great universities. It took alot of work (and one of my new found friends intervening) and I finally got my mom to take to therapy and it worked amazingly, I learned to deal with pain and she taught me to deal with self sabotage. My mother got a job, and a house, and I moved in with her. My father died, and it took a long time, but I eventually forgave him. I don't go see those family members who treated me like that anymore, and it feels good to exist without them.

My point is, things definitely can get better, and if you have a high score or you feel like your bad childhood means you will definitely have a bad life, then please don't think that. Your life CAN get better. It's almost a miracle that my life has turned around this way, I love it now.

2020-08-20 10:25:48,Statutory rape of males and desire as power play.,"So my thoughts are still very much in process on this,  but...

There's a recurring discussion (often with quite a bit of negative pushback) about the ""willingness"" of young boys to engage in sex with older women.   We've all seen it at one point or another,  the endless stream of comments to the effect of ""when I was 16, I'd have fucked my chem teacher in a heartbeat"" or ""where were the teachers like these back when I was in high school?""

As I spend more time considering this,  I can't help but think that this very willingness,  far from excusing the behavior,  is actually what defines it as a power play.  Most 15 year old males would probably have sex in almost any circumstances.   The fact that a 26 year old teacher is aware of this is exactly what makes the behavior exploitative (exploiting a young boy's willingness and natural sexual awakening), attempting simply to get herself some.   

A few years back,  a former classmate (35 at the time?) had posted on Facebook about an incident that had occurred while she was waiting in line in the grocery store.   She'd overheard two young teens commenting about her. 

The first teen commented to his friends that she was hot.   The second mentioned that she had a ring and was obviously married.   ""I don't care, "" the first teen said,  ""I'd still hit that. ""

The classmate posted that story with the statement ""Yeah,  I've still got it. ""

The same classmate also had a propensity for posting comments about how ""yummy"" various younger service staff were if she were out for drinks or dinner.   I'd eventually made the decision that if I saw her do it again,  I might point out that such behaviors might be inappropriate,  especially in a post-metoo environment. 

Before I had the opportunity, I found out that she'd been picked up by police for having sex with one of the students at the high school where she was a guidance counselor,  12 counts of aggravated sexual assault for sleeping with a 12th grader 12 times. 

Is it possible to rape the ""willing""?  Is it possible to use someone's natural urges against them?  Can engendering desire (or leveraging it where it appears) in people be its own form of power play or manipulation? If so,  does this dynamic end at the age of majority?  

Like I said,  my own thoughts on this are completely in early stages.

2020-08-20 01:12:09,"Consent, from both parties","I’ve seen and heard lots of stories of men and women saying how they felt pressured into sex or didn’t want to have sex but didn’t want to say no for one reason or another. 

Consent is a big thing obviously, and has some niches and nuanced scenarios where the basic rules may be blurred, but it still stands that no means no. 

For those of you who need to hear about the rules of consent either to help you in tough situations, or to make sure your never in a tough situation, there is a great short video that explains it pretty well

It goes over unconsciousness, saying yes at first then saying no, saying maybe then no and a few other scenarios people may find themselves in.

2020-08-19 15:18:03,Whats your opinion of narrow male sexual roles?,"Some would say men are the most variable gender when it comes to behaviours (male variability hypothesis), whilst at the same time, men are the gender most likely to repress their unique individual preferences when it comes to conforming to the range of acceptable behaviour that our patriarchial culture deem as ""manly"". Although its important to point out that women have their own issues with their sexual repression and I dont want this thread to turn into a toxic ""who has it worse"" debate. But still, its clear the sex positive feminism has done a great job of allowing more women to enjoy their own unique sexual preferences and kinks that may not conform to puritan traditional expectations. Kudos to them for doing the hard work of breaking repressive social barriers. 


Ive known quite a few sex positive college escorts whove told me that with many men being shamed to commit to a narrow range of sexual behaviour by women and other men that is seen as sexy and masculine, and sex being scarce for the average single man,  many men never really fully explore their sexuality as much as the average sexually empowered women where kinks and out of the norm sexual preference are far more acceptable, although women are still judged in conservative circles. These escorts, specialist in the taboo fantasies of men, are always in demand by men of all types of attractiveness, ages and cultural backgrounds, who feel like they can never explore that side of themselves with their partners or FWBs without being shamed by their lovers and ridiculed by other men, or when they do' its tolerated less than conventional sex where they perform the traditional role. So they use their services on the DL to fulfill their unique but taboo sexual preferences. 

 (Interesting tidbit, a high end escort I knew visited the middle east for a month to see her rich client who had a thing for domination and was so conscious about being seen with a dominatrix from Australia that he pretended she was an intern looking for a position at his firm and she ended up going to the dudes office and daughters wedding, pretending she worked for him. Apparently that was a really weird experiemce, but she got paid)


Many men have also tried to join the BDSM community but have had bad experiences as a result of the shortage of non Sub women. Anyone in the a BDSM community will know that its mainly catered to dom male masters and sub women. Sub men are pretty much seen as the bottom of the BDSM pekking order, as someone I knew from a well known BDSM forum puts it.

Porn use has shown us that men can have wildly diverse sexual fantasies as well. Im sure most men will never want to live out those fantasies, just as the same for women. But I cant help but think there's a large cohort of men who also do want to live out these experiences, and alternative roles, whether that is being dominated to being pursued by a woman and becoming the object of ""desire"".  But because of the patriarchial expectations of the ""man box"", the scarcity of sex and the importance of fulfilling the performative masculine role for many heterosexual women when it comes to getting turned on,  most men are resigned to their narrow role when they enter a relationships or a FWB arrangement. 

 Ive had friends who were very open about their sex lives and felt the same way about this issue, and we all came to realisation that we didnt always liked being pidgeonholed into the dom or the active agent role, yet felt pressured by our partners and society to fulfill that role. We spoke about what turned us on honestly, for the first time in our lives and quickly realised that male sexual preferences was a spectrum we were all over the place. I was clearly a sub/dom switch with an inclination for sub behaviour but my other two friends were sub, and a predom dom  with minor sub predilections. 

This seems pretty taboo to admit as a man and we all felt a sigh of relief that we werent alone in how we felt about rigid and narrow male sex roles. 

A few of the progressive women weve had close friendships with have candidly admitted that they just cant accept sexual passivity or alternative roles for their sexual partners and believe most women are in the same boat, based on their talks with other women about sex. Although perhaps theyre not representative of the average woman.

2020-08-18 14:50:34,Men Always Want Sex,"In a recent thread,  u/Tamen_ made this observation...

>I strongly suspect that more men are aware that they are capable of not wanting sex than there are women being aware of this. I also suspect that a lot of young men don't feel they can express that they do not want sex without their partner or other people makes a lot of assumptions about them (he must be gay, he finds me unattractive and so on). I suspect they too often have sex without really wanting to because dealing with the fallout of saying no is just too stressful/time consuming/emotionally draining/futile.

I don't disagree with this at all.   In point of fact,  I'd even take it a few steps further.   I can want sex and still not be obliged to have it. 

- I can want sex,  but not with you. 
- I can want sex,  but not like this. 
- I have gay friends that want sex,  but not with women. 
- I have religious friends who want sex,  but not outside the parameters of a committed relationship. 
- I can want sex,  but not right now. 
- I have asexual friends that aren't very interested in sex at all. 
- I can want sex, and be upset with the way you're trying to use that against me.   

The list is pretty much endless.   And it fascinates me that this is even a remotely novel concept. 

Does anyone else have stories of being pressured to want sex?  Have you ever felt pushed into sex in situations where it wasn't what you were looking for?  I've a also had friends suggest that they've never turned down sex,  because they figured they might as well get it while the getting is good.  Does the fact that we want sex mean we can't also have standards or boundaries?

I'm not good with titles. :(

I've caught myself doing it too, so I'm pointing at all of us.

Lately, I've had to step back and take inventory of how I, and a lot of my allies, talk about Male abuse victims. I noticed that we're very fixated on how they act or think about their own abuse. We imply that this is a them problem, that this is a challenge that these men need to overcome. That it's toxic masculinity that forces them to not open up, be stoic and refuse to heal. Here's the issue, we really focus on what the victim should or shouldn't do, like we're implying that he's not doing his part or that he's shirking some sort of responsibility. While Toxic Masculinity surely does harm the victims, the way we go about using these concepts and ideas are sometimes extremely twisted. A lot of the time we use them in a way that unintentionally promotes Toxic Masculinity. We might have the best intentions, but the underlying message we send out is of how the victims aren't up to snuff and that they should ""Bizarro Man Up"".

I just listened to an episode of the *How Did This Get Made* podcast,  they discussed the movie *Swordfish.* There's a scene, that clearly depicts the rape of a man, in that movie. The podcast hosts did not see it that way. Notice that this podcast have brought up problematic scenes in the past, when the movie have glorified or trivialized sexual assault on women. This is one example of how all of society, all of us, how *we* erase male victims. The victim's not the ones fucking up here. We can't just participate in a system that actively gaslight him, then unintentionally imply that he somehow failed a test when he bought into it. No shit that they wont deal with it, no shit that they won't talk about it; that's what we've told him he should do all of his life. 

In Summary:  
When you speak with a male survivor or just talk about the topic in general. Don't do it in a way that's toxic on the sly. Don't make him feel like a failure, on top of being a victim.   

I wanted to talk about how we're so patriarchal that we disregard female abusers almost as much as victims. But I feel like that's a whole other topic.

The post was clearly intended to comment on the fact that mens shoes are often cheaper and/or more comfortable than women’s (I haven’t researched if this is true but i wouldn’t be shocked). However it also inadvertently commented on the fact that women have much more variety and choice when it comes to shoes and clothing in general (the shoe is quite literally not available in men’s).

I thought communication = healthy and that this equation always holds, whether the communication was rehearsed or instinctive, honest or deceptive. I fell for the trap of ""joking"" about partners who say ""I'm fine"" when they're not fine, and feeling righteous and clever for knowing things are not fine. ""What's wrong?"" was my tool, and I used it to great effect to ""fix"" - or so I thought.

Here's why I think I was dead wrong:

1. When you ask your partner ""what's wrong?"", the danger is you are probably coming from a place of genuine concern. In that state of mind, you see their reluctance to respond as dishonest, or actively harming the relationship. Then, as a fixer, you fear that things are falling apart, and press with greater intensity, because ah yes - knowing ""what's wrong"" in this exact moment will fix everything \\s. They were just moping around waiting for you to ask, and they were searching for answers and thank god they opened up because you gave them the solutions \\s.
2. When you ask your partner ""what's wrong?"", you are essentially asking their emotions to play to your schedule. You want to know *right now* what's wrong, despite the fact that they may not be ready to talk right now. Olive branch, there are plenty of contexts in which wanting to know ""what's wrong?"" is appropriate; I'm not disputing that. What I'm getting at is that often, the phrase is spoken and pressed with an inappropriate intensity, multiple times, when it's clear that the other party does not intend to have a conversation. It's a powerless feeling not knowing what's wrong, especially if you're at the heart of what's wrong - I get that - but the other person is not required to answer your interrogatives. Now, if your partner does this all the time and it's affecting *your* mental health, you are free to voice that to them and expect different behavior moving forward. But if you don't get the kind of communication you're after, ultimately the only thing that can really change is whether you two are together, and that's the piece you have control over. The only obligations I have for you are that you take care of yourself and be the best partner you can; if something the other person is doing is affecting your health, it's on you to leave, not on them to change (this statement is meant to be independent of abusive situations wherein leaving is difficult or impossible; that said, even there the end goal is to get the hell out of dodge, and to hell this abusive person).
3. If you can tell that your partner is upset, and they're not sharing why with you, they may have not fully internalized why they are upset, and need more time to think on it. Other voices can cloud your thoughts, so ""talking it out"" when you aren't ready to is having your partner invade your train of thought. Whether they mean to or not, their intervention will affect how you process what you're thinking, rather than it being purely *you*. If your partner really wants to know ""what's wrong?"" and wants the unadulterated truth, the best they can do is wait until you're ready to talk. Further, they may ultimately realize they weren't actually upset, and just needed time to process things. An adult will respect that you gave them that space. This is separate from ignoring how your partner is feeling and never checking in with them, but ""how are you?"" is a far cry from ""what's wrong? Tell me! We have to communicate!""
4. Asking ""what's wrong?"" is a directly negative payload. It may seem passive aggressive to retreat back to saying something like ""is there anything on your mind?"" / ""what're you thinking about?"" / ""is there something you want to talk about?"" but they at very least afford your partner the ability to code their thoughts as having any connotation, rather than something being ""wrong"" in your verbage. It may seem like mountains out of molehills, and it may be that something is very overtly wrong, but it's your partner's thoughts, and they should be afforded the ability to code them. Assuming that something is ""wrong"" prods their thoughts and can feel like you're trying to guess at what they're thinking. (Obviously, if they're crying, there's a strong signal something is wrong; ""what's wrong?"" probably makes more sense here than ""how are you?"", you sarcastic fool! If it turns out they're crying happy tears because they found out swans can be gay, it's a benign misunderstanding).
5. If you ask your partner ""what's wrong?"" and expect answers then and there, you are implicitly on the hook to respond then and there. When your partner asks *you* ""what's wrong,"" it's only fair to expect immediate answers from you as well. Your responses will be instantaneous, and as such, you won't had much time to think about what you're going to say. If you give your partner space to breathe and think things through, you have a stronger claim at being entitled to think things through yourself. They can tell you what's wrong after they've had time to organize it, and this is beneficial for three reasons: one, there's a much lower chance of there being something missing that they bring up later, meaning once the discussion's had, it's done. Two, whatever they have to say is going to be communicated probably more clearly, and miscommunication is the cause of a lot of arguments. Three, when you give them their space, you are strongly entitled to say ""okay, let me think on this for a bit"" and you two can deal with the issue in a very clean, calm manner.
6. It is not a ""gotcha"" to find out that your partner *is* upset when they previously said they *weren't* upset. First, it could be the truth, that thinking more brought them to being upset. They're allowed to change how they feel. Checking in at 12pm to find ""nothing"" wrong only to discover something's wrong at 5pm doesn't mean they lied. Second, even if they did lie, this isn't a game where you're trying to catch them in one and then you ""win."" You can have your victory lap in your head, but really should be internalizing: why did they lie at first? If they're dishonest with you, do you think it's because they're being shitty, or scared, or didn't want to make it a real issue? Maybe they thought they could deal with it on their own and actually solve whatever problem it was by thinking it through. Or maybe it's because it's hard to tell you the truth? Maybe you have a habit of trying to get them to ""talk things through"" at the instant something is wrong, not allowing them that aforementioned time to think. Maybe they *want* that unadulterated time to think. Anything is possible, but using ""what's wrong?"" as a constant litmus test of your partner's emotions, and a check-in for whether you've fucked up, is a waste of time.
7. If your partner is in general cryptic, indirect, dishonest, and it's a consistent pattern, that's an issue with the relationship - not something directly solved by saying ""what's wrong?"" Do you really want to live in a relationship where the *only* times things get resolved is when *you* exert, step in, and try to fix things? If things are genuinely *only* ever fixed when you step in, you're repairing a car, not mending a relationship. This repair system is one-sided; if it's true that you are a proven ""fixer,"" and a successful one, do you really want to live like that? If you abandoned this one-sided effort, do things just go to shit? Maybe that's what's meant to happen, then; if your partner does *nothing* to present issues to you, and does *nothing* to deal with matters on their own, and does *nothing* to talk things through with you together (and I mean actually talk things through, not ""here's my list of problems, now answer for your crimes""), you are likely not in a good thing, or with a person who's right for you, to begin with. With maturity, patience, and respect, the right partner is afforded time to think, gives you time to think, and is always your teammate, your friend, always on your side when it comes to resolving ""what's wrong?""",True,192,0.95,30,,/r/MensLib/comments/ibnqc4/learning_to_not_ask_my_partner_whats_wrong_or/,eadala

I couldn't find reference it had been posted before, so I hope it's alright.

I found myself agreeing with a lot of it, and it's not the first time I've heard similar arguments, how there exists some general differences between the makeup of the average male and female brain, but it's a very obscured area in most gender politics. In my own country when clinical neurologists were to weigh in on political policy regarding how to improve boys school performance, I saw it too. In the report there was a very anxious four page long preface where the neurologists had to cushion the blow of what they were going to say, like they were afraid of backlash. Their report was about how cognitive developement in young men naturally has a different pace (most of the time), and how boys in general may be more stimulated by other methods than those which fit (most) girls. None of it seemed very controversial to me.

This is not to say that it applies to each and every person. There's more difference between any two individuals than there is between gender. Only when you look at a large enough number of men and women, some of these differences are very observable, and can't all be explained by culture and upbringing.

2020-08-17 09:38:28,Can anyone please help me understand why do many men don't seek medical treatment when something is obviously very wrong?,"This is personal, so I understand if it can't be posted.  But I had a devastating encounter with my uncle yesterday.  I saw him a couple months ago, he's almost 80 and diabetic.  He had a bad abscess on his toe he went to the ER for.  I bugged him for weeks to go.  Now two months I keep begging for him to see a doctor.  He's refused.  I called yesterday and asked about it and said it was just itching badly.  That alarmed me.  I drove 2 hours to his place.  I inspected his toe, it was horrific it was black and oozing green.  Then I saw maggots poking in and out of the wound.  I'll be honest  I lost it.  And probably for the first time in my life I became hysterical.  To the point I couldn't breath.  I am still reeling from this over 24 hours later.

I have tried to pinpoint in society where men are getting the idea that not seeking medical treatment is OK?  When we're kids our parents take us to the doctor.  If you're injured in a car crash, men are taken by ambulance to the hospital.  If you break a bone you obviously go to the hospital.  I don't understand where the message to men is coming from that not seeking treatment is somehow manly?  Is having maggots in a badly infected toe manly?  I don't get it?  Can someone help me pin point this absolutely absurd notion that going to the doctor isn't for men?

I apologize if this comes off as unsympathetic.  Like I said, I'm still trying to deal with and process this.  This wasn't the only time I've seen a man have maggots in an infected wound.  I've seen this horror on construction sites.    But they weren't my uncle and almost 80 years old and diabetic.  These guys have time to go to bars and such, but not a doctor?  Help me understand this, please?

2020-08-17 05:55:01,Would you be fine with visiting a male psychotherapist?,"Tldr in the title.

(inspired by a recently shared great article: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/iaqgbm/psychotherapy_has_failed_men_by_not_recognizing/, but only somehow related)

Background: I'm a man, almost 30, have problems with depression and anxiety (mostly social). A few months ago I finally pushed myself to give psychotherapy a second chance. But when searching for a therapist, something occurred, which I dismissed back then, but which now came back when reading the article: it's how extremely uneasy I felt with the idea of choosing a male therapist.

There's a lot of male therapists in the area. Rationally thinking, they can't be any worse than female. There's no rule saying men are by definition less emotionally intelligent, less understanding, supportive, etc... especially when talking about experts with many years of emotional help experience.

Knowing that I have anxiety problems, you perhaps understand how hard it was for me to even imagine explaining my emotional issues to an unknown person. I was staring at photos of the therapists, trying to imagine, how they are and how I'd talk with them. Even with women it was very hard, but with men it felt almost impossible. Apparently just a look of a male face, or imagination of talking to a man, made me feel emotionally restrained. Some of the things I wanted to share felt very ""embarrassing"", and I just couldn't imagine a man being understanding and compassionate enough to handle that.

And this is coming from a person believing (maybe correctly, maybe wrongly) to be mostly free from ""toxic masculinity"". Apparently, even though I don't see it in myself, I'm still suspicious of other men being so.

At the end I decided on a female therapist. Although the choice turned out to be pretty good (it's a few months already and I think I made some progress),  I'm still wondering why I felt this way back then. Is it just me, or are there more people having it the same? Do you also feel this emotional-level prejudice against men, in regards to sharing more private, emotional matters?",True,82,0.96,65,,/r/MensLib/comments/ib1b70/would_you_be_fine_with_visiting_a_male/,fideasu

2020-08-15 03:56:24,Male-to-female platonic touching is just as important as male-to-male platonic touching.,"Alot people on this sub, given that this is a heavily Western sub, tend to romanticize how common and normalized male contact is in Middle Eastern countries. As an Arab who lives in an Arab country, while the normalization of male contact is nice, it's not the key to dismantling toxic masculinity and dealing with male alienation or isolation. It also, most importantly, is not the key to getting rid of incels or the objectification of women which I see many people here insinuating is the case.

Firstly, men aren't really allowed to express their emotions. Touching and what not is normalized but that doesn't matter if emotional intimacy is demonized. The touching just ends up being a sort of facade or illusion of intimacy when, if you actually opened up to the friend you're holding hands with, you'd face instant reprisal. Emotional connection, when it happens, can only be wordless which is draining for humans who need language for both communication and validation. You never know if your friend actually accepts you when you're spooning or making jokes. Like in the West, the only acceptable emotions a man can have are anger or humor. Anything sentimental or show of vulnerability is not accepted. As a result, women are still viewed as not only objects for sexual attraction but outlets for emotional vulnerabilities as well just like in the West. This means that women are still overvalued or given a certain status/role which women, as human beings, may not necessarily be willing or fit for fulfilling.

Secondly, men and women are highly segregated. Public friendships with men and women are heavily criticized (generally against the woman because she's viewed as a slut and there's the implication that the man is a sex animal who's only friends with the woman for her body). As a result, some men grow up their entire lives without fully interacting with a woman so they're always seen as the ""other"". Once puberty comes this turns into objectification. This is partially why rape and sexual harassment rates are so high in some parts of the Arab world, because if you have a bunch of unemployed young men who are stressed out and, because a man's value is tied to their achievements, very undervalued and insecure who view women as something that's not human that's going to lead to rape. And this is especially because coming out about rape is going to lead to a majority of society condemning the woman and not the rapist.

Of course rape victims being condemned instead of the rapist is common in all societies even in Western societies where men and women aren't very segregated. Women are still objectified even if it's to a lesser degree in Western societies. Hell, in Mediterranean societies women and men aren't segregated *and* there's touching but toxic masculinity still persists. The point is that you aren't going to solve men's issues by just adding some male-to-male touching, you need to go further. We can't look at each other for the solution, we can't find the solution from the past we need to make something new by ourselves. I have a new idea for how to solve these issues and while it's half-baked, I think this is a step in the right direction.

\*\*\*

Fundamentally, I think men and women, even in the West, are still segregated. No, not physically. They can inhabit the same building or area, they can talk to each other, form friendships, etc. but there is the absence of physical intimacy which I think is important for all emotional relationships. I think it is also very important for humanization and looking at others as equals. Right now, even if men do engage in touching, women are not a part of that. They are distinct in that you can't touch them. Obviously there are good reasons for why women don't like male touching or attention, they always get it and pretty much any touching is not done between friends but strangers and breaks alot of boundaries. However this still results in objectification and, in a society where getting a woman is a big part of being a man, this means that any touching is going to be seen as romantic and guys are going to be touching with very sexual intent. As a result, any sort of touching is seen as not ok and many women absolutely fear male touching even among friends.

However, it's because there's no platonic touching between men and women that guys have no idea what boundaries are, objectify women, view physical intimacy as romantic, and why any sort of friendship with a woman is going to be seen as somewhat awkward in the same way that Western male friendships are somewhat awkward. There needs to be platonic touching so that these problems can be overcome. Platonic touching obviously isn't the only answer (normalizing emotional support between men is also important) but it is a core component. But, you may ask, wouldn't some men take advantage of this and act in a sexual manner? Yes and we need to overcome that but we can't just reject the idea out of hand just because some men might act inappropriately. They act inappropriately precisely because of a lack of platonic touching. They don't know boundaries and heavily objectify women due to their societal status as untouchable (which tends to have other sexist associations like purity or virginity). Thus, we need to overcome this not avoid it.

Obviously rules need to be agreed upon and these definitely should not be binding (different people have different boundaries) just like how dating should be made easier and egalitarian by establishing rules that both men and women can follow and assume that the other knows about. Rather than rules, maybe what we need is a common language or terminology so that both participants can instantly know what the other's boundaries are. Furthermore, bad actors who don't respect the other's boundaries (and remember that this applies to both genders) should be excommunicated or, in very egregious cases, violence needs to be used.

All of this is half baked but I think it's a step in the right direction. I am open to criticism and new idea so write a comment below!

2020-08-14 22:19:03,Refutations of the alleged benefits of infant male circumcision,"If this topic interests you, feel free to join us at r/Intactivism

One of the main defenses of routine infant male circumcision is that it provides health benefits to the child. The idea is that the benefits are great enough that any harm, damage, or potential complications of circumcision are acceptable in exchange for these benefits. With this post, I aim to dissect these claims, the statistics, and the logic/reasoning behind each one.

The commonly claimed benefits of circumcision are that it helps prevent STDs (HIV/AIDS in particular), UTIs, and penile cancer. These claims are touted by [research](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/130/3/e756) done by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the studies they reference. However, [there is a lot of criticism regarding their research](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/4/796).

##Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)

According to the AAP report, it takes over **100 circumcisions to prevent 1 UTI**. UTIs can be treated if and when they occur by using less invasive means like antibiotics. One case of UTI may be prevented at the cost of 2 cases of hemorrhage, infection, or, in rare instances, [more severe outcomes or even death](http://www.cirp.org/library/death/). This would negate whatever minuscule protective benefit circumcision is said to have against UTIs, [but the studies which claim that circumcision can prevent UTIs are flawed](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/UTI/), making it very likely that there is no protection whatsoever. UTIs are rare in men to begin with, especially in young men. Circumcised men can and do still get UTIs. It should also be noted that [women are considerably more likely to get UTIs than men](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5027397/), yet we do not alter their bodies to mitigate their risk. 

**Regardless of gender or circumcision status, UTIs are prevented with basic hygiene and treated with antibiotics.**

##Penile Cancer

Sounds scary, right? Well luckily, penile cancer is one of the rarest forms of cancer in the Western world [affecting about 1 man in 100,000 per year](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/penile-cancer/about/key-statistics.html). To put that into perspective, that is **[100 times rarer than male breast cancer](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/breast-cancer-in-men/about/key-statistics.html)** which itself is 100 times rarer than female breast cancer. Penile cancer is also late-forming, almost always occurring at a later age with the average being 68. When diagnosed early, the disease generally has a good survival rate. According to the AAP report, between **909 and 322,000 circumcisions are needed to prevent 1 case of penile cancer**. Penile cancer is linked to infection with HPV, which can be prevented without tissue loss through condom use and prophylactic inoculation. [""There is a strong association between HPV infection and penile cancer regardless of circumcision status, with 80% of tumour specimens being HPV DNA-positive.[37] It is expected that routine HPV vaccination for girls will dramatically decrease the incidence rate of cervical cancer. The benefit may also extend to penile cancer, especially as the program is broadened to include young men.""](https://www.cps.ca/en/documents/position/circumcision) **Incidence rates of penile cancer in the United States, where 75% of the non-Jewish, non-Muslim male population are circumcised, are similar to rates in northern Europe, where ≤10% of the male population is circumcised**. [It is a myth that circumcision can prevent genital cancers](http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/).

It should also be noted that women get vaginal cancer at a rate of 90 per 100,000 (not including cervical, another 7 per 100,000) and a 1 in 8 chance of breast cancer. But we do not cut off their body parts to mitigate their risk. In fact, we don't cut off any other body parts from babies despite that every single body part has the potential to develop cancer. Circumcised men can also get penile cancer. Circumcision is only preventative if the cells that would have ended up becoming cancerous happened to be on the removed foreskin and not elsewhere on the penis. Currently, the only guaranteed method for 100% risk reduction of penile cancer is to remove the entire penis. 

####Cervical Cancer

Male circumcision has also been touted as a preventative for cervical cancer in women. This was first proposed in 1954, [but has been thoroughly disputed over the decades.](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/for-professionals/alleged-medical-benefits/cervical-cancer/) Cervical cancer is from HPV which has a vaccine. Which is so effective that (turning to news) [""Australia could become first country to eradicate cervical cancer. Free vaccine program in schools leads to big drop in rates.""](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/mar/04/australia-could-become-first-country-to-eradicate-cervical-cancer) Permanebtly altering a boy's body for the potential benefit of his hypothetical future sex partner(s) is a dubious proposition at best. Preventing cancer in women also becomes irrelevant if the boy turns out to be homosexual or otherwise uninterested in women.

**Every body part has the potential to develop cancer. While the logic of ""you can't get cancer on a body part you don't have"" is technically correct, it is fallacious reasoning to justify performing amputations on non-cancerous body parts on infants.**

##Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)

The studies which claim circumcision prevents STDs often confuse correlation with causation. In fact, [circumcision might increase the risk of contracting STDs](https://www.doctorsopposingcircumcision.org/for-professionals/alleged-medical-benefits/sexually-transmitted-infections/), because it can cause pain and bleeding, opening pores for pathogens to exchange between partners. The authors of the AAP report forget to stress that responsible use of condoms, regardless of circumcision status, will provide close to 100% reduction in risk for many STDs.**[Rates of STDs in the United States, where 75% of the non-Jewish, non-Muslim male population are circumcised, are higher than rates in Europe, where ≤10% of the male population is circumcised](https://onlinedoctor.superdrug.com/std-us-eu/)**.

####HIV/AIDS

Another frequent claim is that circumcision reduces the risk of men contracting HIV by 60%. This is based on the results of three randomized controlled trials done in Africa. The researchers found in their studies that  **2.5% of intact men and 1.2% of circumcised men got HIV.** The 60% figure is the relative risk (2.5%-1.2%/2.5%).

If circumcision did reduce rates of HIV transmission, which it doesn't, it would be a small reduction. The Canadian Paediatric Society says this, using estimates from the CDC:

>[“The number needed to [circumcise] to prevent one HIV infection varied, from 1,231 in white males to 65 in black males, with an average in all males of 298. The model did not account for the cost of complications of circumcision. In addition, there is a risk that men may overestimate the protective effect of being circumcised and be less likely to adopt safe sex practices.”](https://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)

These figures are relevant only if the trials were accurate in the first place. There were several methodological errors:

- The circumcised experimental group got more medical care, **including education on the proper use of condoms**
- In one study, circumcised men's infection rates were increasing faster than the intact men's until the study was terminated early 
- The circumcised group could not have sex for 4-6 weeks after the circumcision; this was excluded from the analysis and distorts the results 
- HIV was contracted through means other than sex (e.g. contaminated needles)
- The trials were terminated early when statistical significance was reached. [Though they did reach *statistical* significance, they never reached *clinical* significance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4504060/#idm139937151485984title) 
- Significantly more men were lost to the studies than tested positive for HIV
- Also, many of the researchers had cultural and religious biases

There is no histological evidence which supports the hypothesis that circumcision reduces the risk of HIV/AIDS infections. It is probable that circumcision doesn’t help at all, or potentially even makes things worse. For example, there are statistics showing that there was a 61% relative increase (6% absolute increase) in HIV infection among female partners of circumcised men. It appears that the number of circumcisions needed to infect a woman was 16.7, with one woman becoming infected for every 17 circumcisions performed. 

Further criticism of the African RCTs:

[Sexually Transmitted Infections and Male Circumcision: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/isrn/2013/109846/)

[A fatal irony: Why the “circumcision solution” to the AIDS epidemic in Africa may increase transmission of HIV](http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2012/05/when-bad-science-kills-or-how-to-spread-aids/)

The findings are also not in line with the fact that the **United States combines a high prevalence of STDs and HIV infections with high circumcision rates. The situation in most European countries is the reverse: low circumcision rates combined with low HIV and STD rates**. Therefore, other factors (mostly behavioral) play a more important role in the spread of HIV than circumcision status. This also shows that there are alternate, less intrusive, and more effective ways of preventing HIV than circumcision such as consistent use of condoms, safe-sex programs, proper sexual education, easy access to antiretroviral drugs, and clean needle programs.

**The point becomes moot regardless whether circumcision prevents STDs or not with the simple fact that **babies are not having sex**, ergo have 0 risk of sexually transmitting anything. This risk remains at 0 until they have made their sexual debut. STDs are not a factor for infant circumcision.**

##Balanitis

[Inflanmation of the glans (balanitis) is not common in men and rare in babies.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK537143/) Having a surgical incision in a dirty diaper likely increases the risk of balanitis. [Balanitis can occur in both circumcised and intact (uncircumcised) males. This study reported significantly more balanitis in circumcised boys as compared with intact non-circumcised boys](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1464-410X.1997.00467.x). This risk decreases in all males drastically after puberty. It is easily preventable with good hygiene and most cases respond to treatment in under a week. 

####Posthitis and Balanopothitis

These are inflammation of the prepuce and the prepuce/glans combined respectively. These are both uncommon, unserious, and easily treatable if and when they occur. Circumcision obviously prevents inflammation of the foreskin the same way removing the eyes prevents conjunctivitis. These arguments use the same fallacious logic as pointed out above for cancer.

##Phimosis

The possibility of phimosis (tight foreskin) does not warrant circumcision. Pathologic phimosis is rare. It can be cured by stretching the foreskin gently at regular intervals. For faster results, topical steroids can also be used. In the unlikely event that theses methods don’t work, surgery like Y-V plasty, Z-plasty, and preputioplasty can be done as a last resort. None of these treatments result in the loss of tissue. Moreover, some doctors misdiagnose phimosis in young children, when they're supposed to have foreskins which can't retract, until puberty, though in some cases the foreskin becomes retractable earlier. Improper handling of the foreskins of children can cause phimosis due to scarring leading to inelasticity.

From the Canadian Pediatric Society:

>[""An estimated 0.8% to 1.6% of boys will require circumcision before puberty, most commonly to treat phimosis. The first-line medical treatment of phimosis involves applying a topical steroid twice a day to the foreskin, accompanied by gentle traction ... allow[ing] the foreskin to become retractable in 80% of treated cases, thus usually avoiding the need for circumcision.""](http://www.cps.ca/documents/position/circumcision)

[The foreskin of boys may be tight until after puberty. Phony phimosis diagnoses in boys in America, where unaltered male penile anatomy is misunderstood even amongst doctors, is not uncommon.](http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/)

From CIRP:

>""Phimosis"" is a vague term. In common usage, it usually means any condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot be retracted. Most infants are born with a foreskin that does not retract. [This is normal!](http://www.cirp.org/library/normal/) ""True"" phimosis—better termed ""preputial stenosis,"" because ""phimosis"" has so many different definitions it now is devoid of any useful meaning—occurs in less than 2% of intact males. The incidence of preputial stenosis in circumcised men is actually similar. Of these 2%, 85–95% will respond to topical steroids. Of those who fail this, at least 75% will respond to stretching under local anesthesia, either manually or with a balloon. The arithmetic is simple: At the very most 7 boys in 10,000 may need surgery for preputial stenosis. A number of reports in the medical literature of the United Kingdom indicate that medical doctors are not trained to distinguish between normal developmental tight prepuce in boys and pathological phimosis. This results in cases of misdiagnosis of normal developmental preputial tightness as pathological phimosis in the UK. Alternative treatments for phimosis are effective.

[Conservative treatment of phimosis in children using a topical steroid](http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/orsola1/)

[Cost-effectiveness analysis of treatments for phimosis: a comparison of surgical and medicinal approaches and their economic effect](http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/berdeu1/)

Topical steroids are a real advance in the treatment of phimosis; this approach, which is supported by many studies, should induce medical decision-makers and practitioners to establish the local application of topical steroids as the standard practice for treating genuine phimosis. We conclude that circumcision cannot be justified, as it is in neither the patient's nor society's interest, and is incompatible with current standards of safety, ethics, effectiveness, and rational spending.

[Phimosis: Is circumcision necessary?](http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/dewan/)

[Is phimosis overdiagnosed in boys and are too many circumcisions performed in
consequence?](http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/phimosis/rickwood2/)

It appears that in the Mersey Region many boys are circumcised for development non-retractability of the prepuce rather than for true phimosis and that in consequence some two-thirds of the operations are unnecessary.

####Paraphimosis

This is when the foreskin gets retracted and stuck behind the glans causing constriction. Paraphimosis is, again, a rarity, not worthy of prophylactic circumcision of infants. [There are conservative treatment options for paraphimosis if and when it does occur.](http://www.cirp.org/library/treatment/paraphimosis/)

##Hygiene 

This is a ridiculous reason for circumcision. [Properly washing the penis is enough.](http://www.cirp.org/library/hygiene/) Smegma is nothing more than a mixture of sebaceous oils and skin cells. Just like how everyone has dandruff, everyone has smegma. Intact men, women, and yes, even circumcised men. 

#**Further criticisms of various claims**

[Cultural Bias in the AAP’s 2012 Technical Report and Policy Statement on Male Circumcision](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/131/4/796)

>There is growing consensus among physicians, including those in the United States, that physicians should discourage parents from circumcising their healthy infant boys because nontherapeutic circumcision of underage boys in Western societies has no compelling health benefits, causes postoperative pain, can have serious long-term consequences, constitutes a violation of the United Nations’ Declaration of the Rights of the Child, and conflicts with the Hippocratic oath: *primum non nocere*: First, do no harm.

[Circumcision of male infants and children as a public health measure in developed countries: A critical assessment of recent evidence](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17441692.2016.1184292)

>Although we set aside the burgeoning bioethical debate surrounding the moral permissibility of performing non-therapeutic circumcisions on healthy minors, we argue that, from a scientific and medical perspective, current evidence suggests that such circumcision is not an appropriate public health measure for developed countries such as the United States.

[What is the best age to circumcise? A medical and ethical analysis](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bioe.12714)

>In other words, according to [Morris et al], while complications from circumcision in early childhood (ages 1 year and older) occur about 4 times as frequently as in the neonatal or infant period—assuming that the cited data are correct; more on this below—there does not appear to be a very large absolute difference between complications arising from such neonatal or infant circumcision and adult circumcision, which is the more ethically relevant comparison in terms of the capacity to consent. In fact, even the relative difference in complication rates appears to be modest: the complication rate for adult circumcision, according to the authors, is between 1.13 and 2.53 times that of NNMC, with ‘virtually all’ of the complications associated with the adult form being ‘mild or moderate’ and ‘effectively treated’. If that is the case, then the marginally greater alleged complication rate in adults (in absolute terms, between 0.2% and 2.3%) is arguably of little medical or ethical significance, whereas the capacity of the adult, compared with the infant, to consent to the procedure is of enormous ethical significance.

[The riddle of the sands: Circumcision, history and myth](https://www.academia.edu/9899840/The_riddle_of_the_sands_Circumcision_history_and_myth)

>None of the ancient cultures which practices circumcision have traditionally claimed that the ritual was introduced as a sanitary measure. African tribes, Arabs, Jews, Moslems, and Australian Aboriginals explain it in different ways, but divine command, tribal identification, social role, family obligation, respect for ancestors, and promotion of self-control figure prominently. Jewish authorities make no mention of hygiene, let alone sand, but place stress on the religious significance of circumcision: it is an outward sign of the Covenant between God and his people. The Kaguru of central Tanzania explain circumcision (practiced at puberty on both boys and girls) in terms of enhancing gender differentiation and social control. They consider the uncircumcised penis unclean because it's moistness males men resemble women, whose wet and regularly bleeding genitals are considered polluting.

[Critique of African RCTs into Male Circumcision and HIV Sexual Transmission](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/278023840_Critique_of_African_RCTs_into_Male_Circumcision_and_HIV_Sexual_Transmission)

>On the basis of three seriously flawed sub-Saharan African randomized clinical trials into female-to-male (FTM) sexual transmission of HIV, in 2007 WHO/UNAIDS recommended circumcision (MC) of millions of African men as an HIV preventive measure, despite the trials being compromised by irrational motivated reasoning, inadequate equipoise, selection bias, inadequate blinding, problematic randomization, trials stopped early with exaggerated treatment effects, and failure to investigate non-sexual transmission. Several questions remain unanswered. Why were the trials carried out in countries where more intact men were HIV+ than in those where more circumcised men were HIV+? Why were men sampled from specific ethnic subgroups? Why were so many men lost to follow-up? Why did men in the intervention group receive additional counselling on safe sex practices? The absolute reduction in HIV transmission associated with MC was only 1.3 % (without even adjusting for known sources of error bias). Relative reduction was reported as 60 %, but after correction for lead-time bias alone averaged 49 %. In a related Ugandan RCT into male-to-female (MTF) transmission, there was a 61 % relative increase (6 % absolute increase) in HIV infection among female partners of circumcised men, some of whom were not informed that their male partners were HIV+ (also some of the men were not informed by the researchers that they were HIV+). It appears that the number of circumcisions needed to infect a woman (Number Needed to Harm) was 16.7, with one woman becoming infected for every 17 circumcisions performed. As the trial was stopped early for “futility,” the increase in HIV infections was not statistically significant, although clinically significant. In the Kenyan trial, MC was associated with at least four new incident infections. Since MC diverts resources from known preventive measures and increases risk-taking behaviors, any long-term benefit in reducing HIV transmission remains dubious.

[A comparison of condom use perceptions and behaviours between circumcised and intact men attending sexually transmitted disease clinics in the United States](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956462412472444)

>This investigation compared circumcised and intact (uncircumcised) men attending sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics on condom perceptions and frequencies of use. Men (N = 316) were recruited from public clinics in two US states. Circumcision status was self-reported through the aid of diagrams. Intact men were less likely to report unprotected vaginal sex (P < 0.001), infrequent condom use (P = 0.02) or lack of confidence to use condoms (P = 0.049). The bivariate association between circumcision status and unprotected sex was moderated by age (P < 0.001), recent STD acquisition (P < 0.001) and by confidence level for condom use (P < 0.001). The bivariate association between circumcision status and infrequent condom use was also moderated by age (P = 0.002), recent STI acquisition (P = 0.02) and confidence level (P = 0.01). Multivariate findings supported the conclusion that intact men may use condoms more frequently and that confidence predicts use, suggesting that intervention programmes should focus on building men's confidence to use condoms, especially for circumcised men.

[The Fragility Index in HIV/AIDS Trials](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-019-05554-x)

>The recent report by Wayant and colleagues on the fragility index did not include the African randomized clinical trials on HIV and adult male circumcision. Analysis of these trials may provide insight into the interaction between p values and fragility in overpowered studies. The three trials shared nearly identical methodologies, the same sources of differential bias (lead-time bias, attrition bias, selection bias, and confirmation bias), and nearly identical results. All three trials were powered to demonstrate an absolute risk reduction of 1%. All three were discontinued prematurely following interim analyses that satisfied pre-established early termination criteria.

Circumcision, performed as a prophylactic surgery on infants, does not meet any acceptable standard of health to be considered ""medically beneficial."" Of the three main claims, only one of them has any bearing on the child's health before reaching the age of consent (UTIs). Even assuming the above numbers are all accurate, we are left with miniscule reductions of issues that were unlikely to occur regardless whilst ignoring any benefit to the foreskin or any value it may have to it's owner. We do not see these issues plaguing intact men on a large scale, further showing that these are nothing more than excuses to retroactively justify something that was already being done.

Amputation of the prepuce is admissible under the same circumstances for amputating any other body part:

- The tissue is cancerous 
- The tissue is severely damaged or malformed beyond beyond repair
- The tissue is severely infected (e.g. gangrene)
- The tissue is necrotic 
- The tissue has suffered severe burns or frostbite
- An adult of sound mind has given their full informed consent knowing the risks and outcomes of the procedure (which is, statistically, a very small number of men)

2020-08-14 04:12:35,"In the same way that toxic general roles push women into being Sex Objects, they also push men into being Sex Subjects, and that can be just as harmful but in different ways.","I don't think that I need to explain to the people here why objectifying people (without their consent) is bad. Treating a real Person with their own thoughts, desires, and dreams as a tool to be used only for your own amusement is a toxic and harmful behavior that shouldn't have any place in a healthy society.

However, because of the traditional gender roles assigned to people, men are compelled to be Sex Subjects, those who *perform* sex, whether that's what they want or not.

If you look on /r/sex, there is a stead stream of posts from women who wish their male partners would be more vocal and enthusiastic. They're tired of sleeping with silent, stoic, unenthusiastic people and wish that they would express themselves more. Ironically, there is simultaneously a number of posts from (typically young) men who are timidly asking whether women would even consider men moaning and vocalizing sexy at all!

Why is there such a disconnect? Why are these young men fundamentally not aware of what might make them seem so much sexier to their (female) partners?

Because society tells men that they aren't supposed to be ""sexy"", at least not in the same way that women are. Sex is supposed to be something that men pursue, something they try to earn, something they have to *convince* women to put up with on their behalf. Even the language we use to describe men's sexuality is charged with this; you are trying to *perform*, you want to *get some*, its all about *the chase*. Society sees sex as fundamentally transactional, where women are auctioning the right to have sex off to the highest bidder.

What actually are conventional notions of male attractiveness? No, seriously, what makes a man physically desirable? Our ideas of what the ideal male suitor (another transactional title) are so charged with ideas of proving your worth: wealthy, powerful, confident, charismatic, famous. Heck, the sexiest thing a man is traditionally allowed to do is to *turn down* a woman's advances, because he's so able to *get sex whenever he wants* that he doesn't need to chase every opportunity. 

I experienced this disconnect when I was first starting my relationship with my now wife. I realized that I didn't actually know what I was supposed to do to be a desirable partner to her. Not that I wasn't good at it, or not confident enough, but that I literally didn't even know what I was supposed to aim for. I had never considered what women consider attractive in men, and I didn't even have a concept in mind for what to do, outside of some absurd bodybuilder shtick, which was clearly not what women actually valued. 

The thing is, when I actually *asked* her about it, *she* couldn't come up with a general idea either! At least not one that she had the vocabulary to express out loud. Ultimately we resorted to getting naked and pointing and describing things that she liked and basically reverse-engineering what exactly it was that she was seeking.

Fundamentally, men's and women's sexuality isn't as vastly different as pop culture would lead you to believe. In both cases, individual tastes and preferences are going to vary a lot more than gender-wide averages, if such a thing can even be defined. Confidence and knowing what you want is attractive, a well-taken-care-of body goes a long way. For men in specific, (straight) women seem to focus on male-specific shapes and outlines the same way that (straight) men focus on waists and hips and breasts. Toned forearms, more muscular and less curvaceous legs, a flatter lower stomach instead of the more rounded version women of the same body type have. Stronger chest and shoulders. Some women appreciate body hair and beards, especially since its trendy these days. 

But most of all, *enthusiasm* is sexy, and I think this is the part that many men (including myself) struggle with. Make noise during sex! Unashamedly admit what you want. Let yourself get lost in the moment and stop trying so hard to ""perform"". Complement your partner on what feels good, and when you get complemented accept it, don't just shrug it off or deny it. Its ok to involuntarily start going faster because its overwhelmingly good. Its also ok to turn down sex when you're not in the mood! Men aren't mindless sex machines, and your consent is equally important in any relationship.

Men are constantly being ashamed of if you have a small dick and consequently, it perpetuates some men's insecurity.

2020-08-12 20:35:47,"Girl randomly groped my ass at a party, but I kind of liked it because I found her attractive. But at the same time, a bit offended because she just assumed I'd like it. Is this normal?","Using a throwaway. Around a year ago I was at a college party. I was slightly bent over on a couch when this girl walks by behind me and gropes my ass for a solid second. I jerked back, initially felt a bit violated and then I turned back to see that it was a female acquaintance that I had barely spoken to. I found her pretty and I instinctively had a ""oh, it's *her*, so it's okay"" moment and then stopped feeling violated at all, and actually felt quite flattered. She didn't mention anything about the ass-grabbing and just said hey to start a conversation with me. We had a pleasant conversation but I was a bit interested in someone else at the time so i didn't try pursue anything with her (and later told her about this so she wouldn't pursue anything either).

But later that night I felt a bit... offended? If that makes sense. I was thinking, she was honestly quite lucky that I turned out to be okay with it. What if I didn't want her to touch me? Would she still think it's okay to do? But again, she's quite attractive and I'm sure she knows this, so I think in her experience guys have been okay with her making these very forward advances on them. So this line of thinking made me feel a bit less offended.

Had I not found her attractive, I probably would have been uncomfortable or even lashed out.

Anyway, I just want to ask if you have had similar experiences and if it makes sense to have felt low-key ""offended"". I'd really like to have a discussion about this.",True,2344,0.97,365,,/r/MensLib/comments/i8cy3e/girl_randomly_groped_my_ass_at_a_party_but_i_kind/,SmallUnderstand

As part of that, I had to take a fertility test, which revealed my samples had about 1/10th the normal sperm count. My urologist also informed me my right testicle is quite undersized. He told me that there's a small chance the surgery could improve the count, but I haven't had a follow up test, mostly because its expensive and the only lab that my insurance takes is over an hour and a half away with super inconvenient hours. 

In late March of this year I started having swelling in my left testicle, which was diagnosed as a hydrocele, likely a result of scarring from my previous surgery. I just had to see a new urologist for COVID reasons, and he explained that this could be a reoccurring issue for me, repeat hyrdoceles. He went on to encourage me to bank my sperm because between the already low count, and now two surgeries on my left testicle and a basically non-functioning right one, it will be nearly impossible for me to have kids naturally. 

I'm fine with having kids through IV or adoption or a sperm donor or whatever, how I get kids isn't important. But I am still struggling emotionally with being told that basically before I've even hit 30, I'll be incapable of having kids without medical intervention feels really immasculating.

2020-08-13 02:36:00,How do you set up healthy sensual boundaries for yourself without being too free or too restrictive?,"**TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM**

I hope I can phrase this topic in a way that is suitable for the subreddit. My thought train was triggered by [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/i8cy3e/girl_randomly_groped_my_ass_at_a_party_but_i_kind/) about the dude who got groped at a party and didn't quite know how to feel about it.

Positive touch is something that's not uncommon to talk about on this sub. It's healthy when done in a proper, consensual manner. I think we can all agree on this. But I feel like, for myself, finding that line is difficult. Not with other's boundaries - I'm personally pretty keen on that. It's more like knowing where and how to set them for myself. For the entirety of this post, I'd like to quickly emphasize that I'm exclusively talking about *sensual* touch (hugs, cuddles, etc.) as opposed to *sexual* touch. Also, this is mostly to do with touch from people one's attracted to (My personal example would be with women) but the following discussion could easily reach beyond that limitation if desired.

Like the previous post talked about, men can be touch deprived. This makes it so that when those men do get some touch (positive or otherwise), they can have some trouble interpreting how to feel about it. I'm touch deprived myself these days, and as a result, I'm hyper-sensitive towards it now. Touch, when it's positive, feels *really really good*.

Because it feels so good, I have a tendency to be pretty open to it. I've been single all my adult life, which helps. Historically, my boundaries around casual touch have been fairly loose as a result. Pretty indiscriminate, all said and done. Whatever I could get, and whatever was appropriate, that's what I would take. But there's been some stuff that I've realized about myself recently, and it has to do with my reaction towards being touched.

I find that a lot of the time, if I'm trouched, it triggers this pressing desire to get more of it, because it feels so good. In the rare times that the urge gets satisfied, I mellow out, and I can take more casual touch more often without harm. If that urge to be touched isn't satisfied, which is more often the case with being both casual and appropriate, it drains my mental health very quickly. I'm left feeling worse than I was if I had just not let the person hug me at all. This has consequently lead me to start being much more reserved about my boundaries. It's because I want to be touched so badly that I actually withhold it from myself, just because I know at this point that casual encounters with touch are rarely enough to satisfy me.

While this has led to a somewhat improved mental state, there's a pang within me that still wishes to be as free as I was before. And if I had a reliable source of touch in my life to satisfy the greater urges, I think I could be. Avoiding touch hasn't done anything to satiate my touch hunger. At the end of the day, I do still want to be touched.

These boundaries that I'm setting for myself are confusing. I'm not sure where I should really be placing them. If I'm free about it, it leads to pain from unresolved natural desires. If I'm restrained, there's some relief, but I still don't get touched while putting up a high sort of benchmark for how much touch would be required from someone before they can actually do it (e.g. cuddle with me or forget it). Each one seems problematic.

Maybe I'm thinking about boundaries in the wrong way? I seem to focus on the act being done as opposed to who's doing it. Both are factors in boundary setting for sure, and the emphasis may even be reversed depending on who you talk to.

Maybe I should just go Buddhist and don't get overwhelmed by my desires? That's really difficult in this case (I've tried - this is definitely one of my weaknesses). I'm trying to find ways around that before submitting myself to such difficult, lifelong work.

I can't help but think that it's also a somewhat systematic issue that has helped put me into this double-bind. If men weren't seen as inherently dangerous or didn't have a reputation for misconduct, and if women weren't seen as helpless or without agency, maybe we as a society would be more open to having solutions for issues like this. Obviously this isn't purely systematic, but I'm sure it plays a role. If I wasn't seen as such a threat, maybe it'd be easier to find reliable sources of consensual, sensual touch. Maybe not. I wouldn't mind some discussion around that aspect, though I don't think of it as being the crux of my particular issue by any means. I certainly don't see resolution coming from such broad lines of thinking either.

Anyway, I'd appreciate some help and some discussion about how one goes about setting boundaries for one's self. Because currently, with whatever it is I'm setting for myself, I find myself losing one way or the other.

**TL;DR:** Knowing how to set boundaries for myself in terms of sensual (not sexual) touch is confusing me. I used to be care-free about it, but because it leads to pain from unfulfilled desires, I've restrained it. This has only helped a little, leading to a different set of problems, and hasn't really lead to the solution I'm looking for. Some discussion around how one goes about setting boundaries successfully as well as what determines these sorts of things would be appreciated.",True,33,0.97,13,,/r/MensLib/comments/i8jblv/how_do_you_set_up_healthy_sensual_boundaries_for/,Vinylismist

2020-08-13 01:55:27,Apologising for toxic-masculinity related behaviour,"Hey guys,

There is a question I’m having a hard time balancing my head around : does it ultimately do any good to spontaneously present apologies (especially to women) for toxic masculinity related behaviour ?

This may sound absurd at first glance but please, bear with me. On one hand, I feel like presenting apologies is a healthy social practice that leads to accountability, may lead to coping or possibly forgiveness and gives somewhat of a sense of justice as it acknowledges pain. Spontaneously presenting apologies, especially to a non-woke individual, might also give the opportunity to have a conversation about toxic masculinity, patriarchy, double standard and other gendered issues.

On the other, spontaneously presenting apologies might (appear to) be a way of shifting the narrative to avoid/diminish/control accountability. It may also be a power tool to assess one’s might through common recognition of damage dealt. Denial can also be a two-edged but beneficial coping tool, that spontaneous apologies might deny. Moreover, and on a different subject, dehumanising your wrong doer can also help with coping. Presenting apologies tend to indicate a certain sense of empathy, interests in other’s condition and vulnerability through guilt. All of those fleshes out a gray-scale painted character that, while undoubtedly a wrong-doer, might also be redeemable and deserving of empathy, which may or may not help with coping or holding accountable, considering the sheer difficulty of doing so in a patriarchal society.

So, what’s your take on it ? As woke males born and raised with/through patriarchal standards, how do you deal with your toxicity and accountability in a pragmatic, meaningful manner ?

Edit : burner account because I’m definetly not the best with accountability. Working toward it tho.

Edit 2 : As stated in the comments below, I don’t imply that masculinity is essentially toxic, that anyone should apologies for being/feeling/identifying as male or that penitence is a mandatory component of masculinity.

However, imho, I think most of us males born and raised in a patriarchal society have to a variable degree exposed someone to toxic masculinity related behaviours, other males and oneself included, and that it is part of the road to acknowledge it. I might just be doing so at this very moment without realising it because of sheer naivety. I also think, again imho, that accountability is an important component of sociability, and that in an ideal world, everyone would be appropriately held accountable for their misdeeds. This is definetly not an ideal world, and holding someone accountable, oneself included, can be difficult. That is why I want to have this conversation.

Also, when I talk about apologies, I mean genuine ones. That includes thorough reflecting on self and actions, and a commitment to improvement. I think the question still holds in this situation.

To elaborate on my case, I actually did apologise to people in the past, usually after reflecting on myself for a couple of days or weeks. And as I reflect more on myself and walk the walk of healthier personality, I figured things aren’t that simple. I didn’t rape or physical assault anyone, but I’m definetly guilty of holding and validating models and practices toxic to both females and males.",True,21,0.78,28,,/r/MensLib/comments/i8ijy0/apologising_for_toxicmasculinity_related_behaviour/,chofferblower

2020-08-11 14:42:15,Men's experience(s) as victims of sexual harrasment,"Slight TW (?)

Recently I have seen instances of women sexually harassing men for ""pranks"" on social media, one of whom even played the victim when called out. Examples include airdropping pictures of sex toys to a stranger in a cafe, putting her hand on the thigh of the guy sitting next to her on the metro, and women looking up Scottish guys' kilts.

The response was comprised mostly of disgust and outrage, but some still found it funny. These are isolated incidents, and most people don't even see the problem until you give them an analogy: ""what if their genders were reversed?"" A lot of people defend the woman's actions regardless of any arguments presented to them.

As a woman, I am surrounded by stories of other women being harassed or assaulted, but not those of  men. Even if assault is sometimes addressed, I have almost never seen a guy talking about being sexually harassed.

So I want to know a few things. How common is sexual harassment for men? If it happened to you, did you do something about it? Regardless of whether you did something about it or not, what was the aftermath (people defending the perpetrator, telling you to ""loosen up"" and take a joke, etc.)? How does this affect GNC people?

2020-08-10 16:24:00,How do I tactfully integrate trans men with feminism without making them feel dysphoric?,"Hi r/menslib! 

Let me explain my position. Basically I believe that feminism is for everyone and everyone regardless of gender is welcome in the feminist community. I still believe however that a majority of feminist resources should be used to aid women (just like a majority of menslib resources should be used to help men). That being said, trans men do face some issues that are also considered feminist issues. 

First let me say that I am a trans ally. I have been one for many years now, and I consider trans men = men and trans women = women. That being said trans men will have certain experiences that cis men don't and that are also considered feminist issues.

For example, especially if you are a trans man and you probably got treated 'like a girl' before you came out. Many trans men grew up being viewed as little girls before coming up as trans. That means that they faced the challenges of being a young girl without being a girl i.e having a stricter dress code at school, being  bullied in a sexist way, gender roles pushed on them, doing unequal housework etc. And even when trans men grow up, depending on where you are at during your transition, trans men might still need to use certain hygiene products or reproductive rights. So issues like the pink tax and access to abortion will still effect them, which is a big part of feminist issues.

Now, here is my problem. I want to know how to bring this up in feminist and trans circles without making trans men feel dysphoric and I certainly don't want them to think that I feel like they aren't 'real men' so if anyone (especially trans men) on this sub have any input than please let me know how you feel about this.

Quick background: I was kinda shy and reserved for most of my life with few friends all the way through till where I am now, university. Along the way I've managed to pick up a few friends and keep them. Now I'm I'm university and I'm still in tight friends with a lot of my  high school friends today. We play games online, go out to clubs, play sport (pre covid) etc. I've been at university for 2 years now and during my time here, I've been doing sociology and anthropology, all relevant degrees and they've enlightened me about so many issues plaguing our world today and eventually, that's how I landed on this sub. 

Leading on to my question. How do I speak to them about these important topics? My friends aren't the most ""woke"" people. They often make derogatory comments about serious issues and women. They still have competitions to see who can hookup with the most girls, some of them refuse to view trans women as real women, while others are still homophobic. Any time I try even call them out or question their views they tell me I've ""changed"" and that I should ""stop being a feminist"". My friends aren't used to seeing me advocate for social issues but they aren't in support of it either. 

Before anyone thinks I may be in a toxic situation, I just want to say my friends and I have fun. We even get deep sometimes, helping each other through break ups, I've helped a few of them through other difficult times as well, and they've helped me too. And it's not often they act like this, but lately it's been getting to me that I can't seem to educate them. I am really a people pleaser, so it's already hard for me to stand up to people or be assertive, let alone my friends. I literally have no other friends besides these people so I can't just branch out and find new ones.

2020-08-10 10:52:16,A statistic from 1 in 6 (sexual abuse trigger warning),"In a recent discussion on the sexual assault of males, someone posted a link to the 1in6 website 

https://1in6.org/get-information/the-1-in-6-statistic/

One of the more fascinating statistics I found on the webpage is as follows...

>Only 16% of men with documented histories of sexual abuse (by social service agencies, which means it was very serious) considered themselves to have been sexually abused, compared to 64% of women with documented histories in the same study.


I know that in starting discussions we're asked to provide or own thoughts on the discussions we start,  but I'm somewhat at a loss here.   I definitely don't wish this to turn into a discussion about relative prevalence of female/male sexual abuse rates,  but I'm absolutely astounded at the idea that even in clearly abusive situations,  men are extremely unlikely to consider themselves as victims of abuse. 

Does anyone have any ideas what goes into unpacking that statistic?  I know that in discussing incidents from my own past,  I've heard a plethora of comments from both men and women suggesting that it doesn't quite count as abuse (she must have really liked you/ like any guy would turn down sex/  you'd be a fool to complain about that/  that's not sexual harassment, it's fucking awesome/ but she's hot,  e.t.c)

But I'm really sort of astonished that you can put a guy into a situation that's abusive enough that social services is involved,  and they'll still not recognize it as abuse. 

What are the stories guys tell themselves in such situations?  Is there a compelling need (internal or external) for them to deny that they've been abused?  Does it help men to view themselves as victims (this is a question that's been put to me directly before)?  Does it help them to (be able to) recognize abuse when it happens?  Do the people who prey on males count on this ignorance to cover their actions?  Do they facilitate it (gaslighting) to cover their own abusive behaviors?  Is this mentality limited solely to sexually abusive behaviors?

I'm having quite a time working through my feelings and thoughts on this.

I realized how most popular, famous men exude toxic masculinity and that's what their fanbases are made around. Don't get me wrong there are many positive male rolemodels, I watch WWE and people like Mustafa Ali, Roman Reigns and Daniel Bryan really show Positive Masculinity and they are amazing people. But there are a few bad eggs everywhere, but the problem is these few bad eggs gain popularityand they get that for nothing other than being bad eggs. Let's talk about Mainstream so everyone could understand better.

Not only that but he compared flirting to rape. He literally said I don't flirt since this metoo stuff in case I won't be called a rapist. Which is such a false narrative he's spreading among his fanbase. How can you compare rape and sexual harrasment to flirting, how could anyone look up to such a toxic person. But the thing I want to talk about is why do such people get so popular. I remember everyone hated the Man of Steel and no one thought he was a good actor or anything but then he said this sexist stuff and magically got a new fanbase who defended everything he says or does.

And what I think is a major reason is that they each in a different way tell a certain subset of men who are frustrated with dating that what they already believe is true.  So like a lot of guys who struggle with dating feel like there is some kind of code they haven't cracked, and conventional advice like ""just be yourself"" etc seems like someone is hiding the code book from them.  So what do pua sites do? they say ""here is the code book have at it"".  Now it might all be total bs or manipulative but it is going to seem super appealing if you feel like someone is finally giving you the real deal.  Similarly some men feel like if they aren't finding a relationship it must be because they are fundamentally unattractive, and if they express this most people will push back, but the incel community says ""absolutely.""  So I think what can be tricky about addressing these things in a more ethical way is that 1) sometimes the ethical thing to say is ""we don't have all the answers"" which is unsatisfying and 2) addressing these things ethically means you can't just affirm whatever it is someone believes if it isn't actually true.   And like the specific question of ""why am I struggling with dating"" doesn't have a one size fits all answer because there could be a lot of reasons for particular individuals.",True,236,0.94,86,,/r/MensLib/comments/i6exdb/why_toxic_resources_for_men_thrive_they_tell/,Jon_S111

2020-08-07 20:50:30,On feeling beautiful,"As a man, I feel like I want to be seen as (physically) beautiful. I don’t know if other men feel the same way. But it seems silly to me that anybody would see me in that way. This may be because being beautiful is associated with femininity and thus being a “beautiful man” is an oxymoron. Or perhaps, it’s because I’ve never had anybody mention my body in a positive way (unless being told that you’re skinny is a positive thing). 

I’m a fairly skinny person and so I don’t fit into the stereotypical wide shoulders, big arms, etc shape. I workout and am in good shape so I’m healthy but not “good looking”

I feel like it’s harder to see men as beautiful because most people say that wearing a suit makes one look good. A suit is something that covers the body to a great extent where only the face and hands are visible. I take this as a man’s body doesn’t look good unless they conform to certain standards so it’s covered up with layers of clothing that mostly hides a body shape. A suit is seen as good because it projects wealth and status so it’s not even about the body. 

Hell, if you are a man and you want to show off (such as wearing a tank top), you can be seen as a tool or douche unless you are at the gym. Or with shorts, they typically end just at the knee because people don’t want to see a man’s legs. I occasionally think how nice it would be to have a body that people would perceive as good to look at. I think how nice it must be to have people appreciate your beauty because feeling invisible sucks for the most part. I guess, feeling desirable is something I’d like to feel for once.

2020-08-08 00:32:27,Random Thought on Improving Clothing Sections/Stores,"This is just a small thought experiment that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but I am genuinely curious to see if other people have thought as much.

Do you see potential positive benefits of the inclusion of unisex section in clothing stores? Because for me, I can only see positives, and, if I had any kind of pull in that industry, I would push for it.  
This was prompted by a few self-centered concerns, naturally, but I can see a lot of other people getting a lot out of it too. I don't know how common it is in all clothing stores around the world, but, most of the time when in a menswear section, I often find myself disappointed by the serious drab display I find. I like bright and bold colours, perhaps set against a distinctive pattern, but the powers that be seem to think that all men prefer things that are irritatingly monochrome, where the only dashes of colour are so pale they look like they'd been diluted beyond recognition. Womens' sections tend to be more colourful, though in a lot of cases I doubt the things I like the look of there (which isn't most things, it has to be said) would even fit me. I think it would therefore be considerably better to introduce unisex sections of such shops, so the things you shop for are all about aesthetic and aren't skewed with the consideration of gender stereotypes. Many online places offer unisex T-shirts, for example, so I can't imagine working on the proportions should necessarily be that difficult (people of all genders have various body types anyway!). If anyone knows if such kinds of shops already exist, then let me know, because I haven't seen any.

2020-08-07 19:59:29,Ashamed of doing “feminine” things,"I still catch myself embarrassed when I start reading labels at the grocery store. Because “dieting” is apparently feminine and femininity is bad. I then get pissed at myself and openly read these labels but I’m self conscious the entire time. 

Like there is this clear societal misogyny but it affects men as well. As a kid, I was embarrassed to watch certain cartoons so I did that in secret.  I was ashamed to admit I liked chick flicks. I still catch myself making excuses in my head in case someone asks me why I’m doing cardio and not manly manly weightlifting. It’s insane. Nobody ever asked me anything yet I make up excuses in my mind all the time. 

I feel like this moron Rush V with his manly “baking science”. And all these terms men created because they are afraid to seem womanly. Like “bulking and cutting” instead of dieting, skinmaxxing instead of “skincare”. Or one time I had white cast from a mineral sunscreen on my face that made my eyebrows blue, and a friend pointed it out. He never asked why I’m wearing sunscreen but for some reason I had to justify why I am wearing it saying that skin cancer is no joke. What the hell! First - he never even asked me, and second - I wear it to keep my skin young, not because of skin cancer. Why is caring about your appearance seen as feminine bad and shallow? And also funny how redpilled gym bros care about their appearances as much as women caked in skincare products, but one is called shallow and another isn’t. 

Because let’s be fucking real. The absolute majority of you goes to the gym to be hot. So it isn’t any less shallow than a woman putting in makeup. 

This is actually ridiculous and is in fact the opposite of masculine as they see it. Because being afraid of a word, being so fragile and scared to be caught doing something associated with femininity is honestly such a pussy behaviour. 

There is nothing more masculine than being comfortable in your own skin, embracing things you enjoy and giving up misogynistic ideas “woman bad”.

2020-08-07 10:24:41,"The notion of being ""attractive"" - can it mess with your head","So the notion that there is a single definition of attractiveness and that everyone will consider the same set of men or women more or less attractive is a pretty common one, and I was thinking about how this can often mess with guys' heads.  Obviously this notion is definitely sometimes applied to women as well but hey this is men's lib and I was specifically thinking of it in connection with what it's like dating as a guy, and in my case one who is interested in dating women.  

So, I think the idea of there being a single universal idea of what makes a man attractive or appealing to date is pretty obviously untrue, but it seems to be kind of pervasive.  I think the reason it can be so hard to shake off is that while there isn't a universal definition of attractiveness, but there are some things that generally are a positive for many or most or almost all women who might be interested in dating men. Like yeah being well groomed is probably usually a good idea.  Being in shape is almost always better than not.  Etc.  But I think people tend to make the mistake that these are the only factors that are actually going to play a role in finding a partner.  So that of course encourages us to compare ourselves to virtually all other guys and if we are not like perfect physical specimens to feel insecure about ourselves.

But I think what this ignores is that sometimes what matters are the things that might not be most universally attractive qualities but things that are particular to each person.  Like tastes in music or personality compatibility or a million other things that might be massively appealing to one potential partner but irrelevant or a turn off to others.  But like for whatever reason this seems to not get factored in to people's sense of self worth.  

What about everyone else? Do you think that there's a single set of factors that determines whether any potential partner is interested?  Do you focus on those things that you know most people find attractive? How much do you think those qualities matter? Does the notion that there is a lot of variety in what a potential partner might value or prioritize seem plausible?",True,71,0.92,47,,/r/MensLib/comments/i55iqm/the_notion_of_being_attractive_can_it_mess_with/,Jon_S111
2020-08-07 07:02:03,Dating apps and men's self confidence,"So I noticed on a couple of recent discussions about dating that a lot of men have mentioned not only that they find dating apps to be a not very good way of actually finding a date but that the entire experience ended up being really demoralizing and in some cases shattering for their self confidence.  I don't know quite what the solution to that is since dating apps won't go away and like I dunno myself how to design a better one, but I do think I broadly get a sense that it is having a negative effect on some guys who are already maybe feeling somewhat insecure about dating and I wonder if it could be helpful to sort of talk about how they can be this negative experience particularly if you can't sort of emotionally detach yourself from the results. 

I think the problem is particularly bad because dating apps are skewed in their gender ratios compared to real life.  Most dating apps are heavily skewed male ( [this is](http://www.netimperative.com/2019/04/05/online-dating-trends-men-outnumber-women-on-tinder-by-9-to-1-while-grinder-wins-for-age-diversity/) the only study I found from the last couple of years but if anyone else has something else worth adding let me know). 

One other issue that strikes me as a potential problem  - a lot of men might join dating apps precisely because they don't feel like they have a lot of other options or dating experience, but since online dating requires crafting a persona to an extent (not that it is inherently dishonest but like you do have to deliberately pick photos and what you will write in your profile) they might not have a good sense of how to highlight the features that will be most likely to help them in a dating profile.  But that is not something that might not be immediately obvious so it can be easy to take a lack of results as a personal rejection. 

Relatedly I had the observation that a lot of men who have talked about their negative experiences sort of view dating apps as a competition with essentially all other guys, rather than a sort of attempt to find compatibility. I was a bit surprised by that but I would appreciate hearing others' thoughts

Do a lot of people find that dating apps can have this negative effect? Are there ways to use dating apps that can help shield people's self confidence from a potential lack of results?",True,85,0.97,93,,/r/MensLib/comments/i52cfx/dating_apps_and_mens_self_confidence/,Jon_S111

2020-08-07 07:53:42,"New idea popping up across the internet: giving consent is considered ""sexy."" How does this fit into men's lib?","There are some communities on Reddit and other corners of the internet where I've noticed people posting comic strips or short videos (whether it's something softcore porn related or general romance/intimacy) at least somewhat alluding to *consent.*

For example:

In a comic strip depicting a young gay couple, one is wanting to get frisky and asks to do something sexual with the other, but his partner politely declines. This causes the initiating person to kindly back off and respect the boundary that was just set, rather than pushing and insisting upon his own desires. I've noticed in posts like these, many comments will mention how ""consent is so sexy,"" etc., and I've seen similar reactions from people all over the place pointing to consent as something very erotic.

This got me thinking...*why is consent so sexy to people?* The solution I came up with leaves me a bit sad yet...hopeful. Sad because I think the reason it's sexy is that we become attracted to things that feel like ""taboo"" and in many societies, consent is still a topic that's untouched among people of all ages. At least, there's a huge hole in the US's sex education where the topic of ""consent"" should undoubtedly be. The reason this whole concept gives me a tiny bit of hope though, is because I think this attitude may actually get people to think about consent more and recognize it as an integral part of the physical human experience, not just a paper you sign at the doctor's office.

To put this in the context of Men's Lib:

2020-08-05 04:20:35,How to talk about male victims of sexual violence?,"This post is partly based on conversations I've seen here on /r/menslib and partly in the wider world. In short, I've seen some very concerning things, even here in what should be a safe space. Consider everything past this point to have a trigger warning.

So, as the title suggests, I was sexually assaulted on a date two years ago. I don't usually call it rape, but as time goes on, the word seems to fit more. I could share all the details, but that would serve little purpose other than re-traumatizing others. Instead, I'll share the effects it had on me. I get flashbacks that make my body tense and freeze up all the time. Sometimes it happens when something reminds me of her or that night, sometimes it happens when I see discussion about sexual assault in general, or sometimes it just happens with no explanation. I don't say any of this to make you feel sorry for me; I just thought you should know where I'm coming from here.

This all happened right around the time of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court, so there was a lot of discussion of rape and sexual assault in the news and social media at the time. Of course, because of the specific incident and the epidemic-level rate at which women experience sexual violence, almost all of this discussion was focused on male perpetrators and female victims, often even using ""men"" and ""women"" as shorthand for ""perpetrators"" and ""victims.""

This was awful for me. The constant discussion of rape and sexual assault resurfaced memories of what happened all around me, but in a way that didn't acknowledge me as a victim in the situation. I understand that I'm a bit of a statistical outlier, but human beings are more than just statistics. Maybe it's not worth it to include male victims in the conversation given the gender disparity that does exist, but I have to imagine that we can do better than we currently are.

Of course, anti-feminist spaces also deal with sexual assault in even more horrible ways. Male sexual assault is often used as a response to try to shut down women talking about their experiences. This is disgusting to me; I don't want my trauma to be used as a club to invalidate the all-too-common trauma of women, especially by people who aren't otherwise doing anything about it. Other anti-feminists will bring up false accusations as a response to women talking about rape, but the fact of the matter is that men are more likely to be raped than falsely accused of rape, and casting doubt on survivors' stories helps nobody.

That said, what really made me want to post this now was some concerning conversations I've seen right here in /r/menslib. There have been a few posts about dating advice for men in the last few days, and every single one of them has devolved into conversations about men's insecurities coupled with explanations about how women are afraid of rape and sexual assault. These are important and necessary conversations, especially for men who might not know the extent to which fear of rape governs women's actions, but both sides of these discussions seem to take it for granted that men don't have to worry about it from their end. This is understandable; for a long time, I didn't think it would happen to me. But then it did, and ever since then I've realized that consent going both ways isn't just a platitude: it's the only way to live a moral life and recognize when you've been harmed. A lot of men don't think it will ever happen to them, but it's truly impossible to know, and everybody needs to have a knowledge of consent. Immediately after my traumatic experience, I told some friends about this horrible night I had with sexual contact I didn't want, but I didn't even process the fact that it was sexual assault and arguably rape until they pointed it out to me. I was feeling confusion, self-loathing, and guilt for ""leading her on"" until I realized that I had been violated in that way and that it wasn't my fault. I'm not saying this should be the main focus of /r/menslib or these conversations, but I hope everyone can keep this in mind when having these discussions.

tl;dr a lot of the conversation around sexual assault and rape frames it exclusively as an issue perpetrated by men on victims who are women. While I understand that that's the most common scenario that needs to be addressed, I hope to see a world where male victims are acknowledged more than they currently are. I know there are other men out there like me who are suffering and unsure of how they fit into the conversation, so I want to make sure they have a place. Also, if I've said anything wrong or offensive in this post, please let me know; I'm always trying to do better.",True,351,0.98,54,,/r/MensLib/comments/i3qyv3/how_to_talk_about_male_victims_of_sexual_violence/,Aflimacon
2020-08-05 01:59:45,We need to find a way to help men access real help,"One thing about MRA’s, incels and pick up artists that really gets on my nerves is how they’ve made it difficult for men in need to find good help. For instance, a man who struggles romantically and seeks a little support could all too easily stumble on an incel forum. One who tries to change their situation could be directed to a pick up artist boot camp. Someone who seeks support after losing custody over his kids due to bias against fathers could wind up on an MRA forum. The problems and vulnerabilities of these men makes them more susceptible to these things while not actually helping them. 

I think it’s important that we find a way to first, identify actual helpful places and resources men can find ranging from good support networks to those struggling to guides to improving your love life that don’t reduce women to prizes.

2020-08-02 11:22:14,"Talking through our dating insecurities, starting with mine","So obviously modern dating is kinda a mind field and I have started a couple of threads about them here in the last couple of days. I also have seen a couple of people bring up their own particular insecurities and saw that a lot of the follow up conversation was valuable.

By way of background I am a straight cis guy, but of course this thread is meant for anyone and everyone who wants to discuss this topic.

But as for my biggest insecurity - i notice i tend to very often feel a lot of anxiety on dates if my date and I have not yet kissed for the first time.

But in cases where I am on a date, I am interested in the woman I am on a date with, I often find myself getting nervous about whether she is interested in me, whether I am saying something to ""screw it up"", when is to soon for a first kiss, and also find myself having to resist the urge to read into every minor word and gesture.  This description may be making it sound worse than it is because this is often just a sort of internal dialogue that I mostly push into the background but on average i definitely feel more anxious and unsure of myself during that sort of time period.  Usually before a first date in terms of asking someone out I can take an ""if it works out it works out"" attitude and for whatever reason after a first kiss I tend to also just have an attitude of ""well if we are actually compatible it will work itself out"" again.  I think what might be because I am pretty self confident in the idea that I'm an interesting and fun person to be around on a basic social level, but much less secure in the idea that someone might actually be romantically or sexually attracted to me. So even if a woman seems very engaged on a date I often can rationalize it as ""well she might just find me an interesting person in a platonic way."" And then for whatever reason a first kiss just kind of satisfies that anxiety.

edit: thinking a little more about this, this feeling particularly happens mostly in situations where the date is going well and my date seems interested and engaged in our conversation, but where I don't particularly pick up on a flirty vibe.

So do other people have their own particular anxieties about dating that stand out? Anyone experience something similar? If anyone got over something similar please chime in of course.",True,89,0.93,189,,/r/MensLib/comments/i25cxp/talking_through_our_dating_insecurities_starting/,Jon_S111
2020-08-02 04:23:49,Society's perception of male kindness,"So I stumbled upon [this picture](https://i.redd.it/z6ljn504oce51.jpg) that had been posted somewhere else on reddit and then visited the comments section. Pretty much every single comment on it was how the boy in the picture was a 'simp' or how he did it 'for the pussy'. I was appalled, not only because of the comments, but because I realized how I had thought the same for a moment.

I realized men are always viewed as sexhungry animals first and humans capable of kindness, platonic relationships and empathy second. The indoctrination is so strong that even myself, a person that considers himself to be both a feminist and a mens liberation advocate, thought the same at first.

2020-08-02 09:06:20,"Standardized, widespread consent workshops, how valuable would they be?","So thinking on a few threads in this sub that touched on consent, one topic that came up a few time is the concept of consent workshops.  These are more prevelant in specific communities like the poly and bdsm communities, but I wonder if they might have a lot of value if they were a widespread and normalized phenomenon.  Perhaps if they became big enough completing a workshop would alloow you to attach a completion badge to an online dating profile.   To be more specific, the type of workshop i am referring to will have specific discussions on what consent is an isn't, provide rules for requesting consent and ways to eitehr accept or refuse consent, and involve practical exercises where people practice both asking for consent, giving or refusing consent, and corresponding appropriately to refusal.  These workshops are often mixed gender and the concept of consent is presented in a gender neutral way, not because there isn't a gender imbalance in sexual assault but because the rules do apply to everyone.  These workshops have maximum value when both potential romantic partners have taken the same course.

The potential benefits seem to be 

1. makes it harder to claim ""miscommunication"" - people who commit sexual assault often use miscommunication as an excuse.  While this shouldn't ever be acceptable, having a specific set of rules sepcified in advance makes it much harder to get away with this excuse.
2. creates less awkwardness around asking for consent - people who do care about consent nonetheless often find asking for explicit verbal consent to be awkward.  If certain methods are covered in the course and specified as normal, and you know your partner has covered the same course, it becomes less awkward
3. creates less awkwardness around refusing consent - people sometimes feel awkward saying no.  knowing that both you and your partner have attended the same workshop on refusing consent can reduce that awkwardness
4. makes further conversations about consent easier - obviously the workshop can't cover everything but because it creates a common baseline and a standard set of experiences, it makes further conversations easier.  Bringing up consent out of the blue can be awkward sometimes but it is much more natural to say ""hey you know how at that workshop they said xyz?""

Potential drawbacks

1. Creating a false sense of security - obviously no workshop can cure bad intentions, so predatory people can take this class in order to obtain the credential and lull others into a false sense of security.
2. Teaching predators how to talk the talk - people intent on doing wrong might be able to use the language taught at the consent workshops to present themselves as concerned about consent and cast doubt on allegations against them.
3. Using the workshops rules as a checklist - bad actors might not break the rules, but rather follow the letter of the law while doing everything possible within those rules to create a high pressure environment and get to a yes
4. the workshop's discussions on refusing consent could be used against victims - While obviously workshops should never suggest that there is only one right way to refuse consent, it will have to cover specific examples, and someone refusing consent in a way not covered could be used in bad faith as an excuse to ignore the refusal.

Anyway,, what do people think of this concept? have people been to workshops like this? would you go to one if it became a thing? what are the realistic chances they could become a widespread phenomenon? are there other benefits/problems I have not listed?",True,44,0.81,46,,/r/MensLib/comments/i23irr/standardized_widespread_consent_workshops_how/,Jon_S111

2020-08-01 06:40:54,"""Firm"" handshakes","So, I understand a lot of people don't like handshakes, and I don't mind doing them as long as I don't feel like anyone would be endangered by the handshake, or I just genuinely do not want to shake someone's hand. Obviously this would mean no handshaking during the pandemic, and the reason not involving danger would probably be that I think that person I'm not going to shake hands with is a complete monster. I'm not a fan of handshakes, but I kind of ""get"" them, I think.

What I don't get at all is the culture behind ""firm"" handshakes. I get not wanting to be the one moving the other person's hand, or not wanting their hand to slide around your grip, that could feel weird. This is why my standard is, hold each other's hand, and you both move your arms in unison.

I don't see any real reason it should feel like anyone's hand is being squeezed at all, nevermind the people deliberately squeezing down hard. The reasons I get for this always come off as superstitious, or sounding very much toxicly masculine (even though it isn't just a ""guy"" thing, but in my experience it's always been reinforced by significantly older men, and they're the only people who have commented on my handshake).

Seriously, the reasons I've seen have been:

1. Testing to see if someone's trustworthy, interested in, or wanting the interaction. I feel like eye contact, a smile, and actually having touched your hand at all are better indicators for interest or wanting the interaction, and judging someone's trustworthiness based on body language isn't good: people are either deliberately communicating to you with it, or are doing it poorly, or you're reading it poorly.

2. Testing ""grip strength,"" as though anything less than them trying to destroy your hand in their grip would be remotely indicative of any kind of strength, or being able to maintain a grip without it feeling like anything's being squeezed wouldn't be more meaningful as a demonstration of self-control.

3. Asserting dominance, which has basically no other reading than machismo, and seems to lean towards squeezing overly hard, not just squeezing.

4. Some other judgement of character (""this person is weak,"" ""this person thinks I'm weak"" or some such). Absolutely baffling.

 I know this is a very minor, non-issue type of thing, it's petty and silly, but it's something that's just been in my mind again lately, and this feels like an appropriate place to post about it. I rarely handshake anyone, and can see why someone might think handshakes in general should be done away with (not that anyone's doing them right now), but does concept of ""firmness"" have any basis in anything outside of an overly aggressive or superstitious culture? Why should it be important to anyone that it feels like their hand is being squeezed, or that someone feels them squeezing their hand? Why would anyone want this?",True,41,0.92,24,,/r/MensLib/comments/i1h7um/firm_handshakes/,oscillating391

2020-07-31 17:36:32,Let's Talk about Mental Health issues and Sports,"I'm not gonna write a dissertation here just gonna throw this out there that if we want to talk about men's issues we're going to have to talk more about men's activities.

Hi, I'm a 'retired' collegiate athlete who used to love the sport of basketball.  Played at a middle-of-the-road (average) NCAA Division 3 college.  I myself only played marginal minutes in the short 2 years I spent playing college and I can firmly say I regret almost all of it.  

See back in high school I suffered from abusive coaching.

That's about all I want to say about it.  It wasn't physical, but you don't need it to be physical.  When you can hold so much power over an athlete's head that you can, with just a few words, send their life into turmoil over losing their dream...  You don't need to hit them because what you're doing is stripping that kid's base desires down.

Train your kids up, sports are good for them, make them into little soldiers who are disciplined and athletic and powerful.  Instill those dreams into them, that one day they can be the superstar.  

And then turn that dream, that very idea of being one of the best there ever was...  Into a weapon you can exploit against them.

It becomes like a twist of the knife.  Once a knife is inside someone its easy to turn it to make the pain worse.  In the same way, once you've got a kid set on dreams of greatness they're already set upon the path towards pain.  All you've gotta do at that point is threaten play-time and a starting position to break them down.  

Strip an athlete of all that they are besides the sport they play.  ""All I know is -ball"".  And then the only thing you've gotta do to make them hurt?  Try to take it away from them.

-----------------

Now enough with the melodrama.  I'm gonna be serious for a moment.  **If there's a single part of this post that you read let it be this one**

Fact of the matter is that [abusive coaching is common](https://education.msu.edu/sport-coaching-leadership/how-to/under-acknowledged-yet-common-preventing-emotional-abuse-in-sport/#:~:text=Under%2DAcknowledged%2C%20Yet%20Common%3A%20Preventing%20Emotional%20Abuse%20in%20Sport,-January%2031%2C%202019&text=One%20such%20negative%20experience%2C%20emotional,%2Dterm%20and%20long%2Dterm.)

A lot more so than you probably realize at first glance.  See on the TV's everyone basically speaks the same game.  All the pro-athletes are trained very well to play the role of someone who's got it all together.  [Even when they don't](http://www.athletesforhope.org/2019/05/mental-health-and-athletes/#:~:text=Among%20professional%20athletes%2C%20data%20shows,burnout%2C%20or%20depression%20and%20anxiety.)

And the fact of the matter is that every kid in sports is trained to be the next big damn hero in the long line of heroes in sports.  They're placed into a [deadly cycle](https://drjacksinger.com/the-long-term-effects-of-abusive-coaching-practices/) that only leads to future self-loathing.

Y'all know the stereotype of the ""peaked in highschool"" guy who can't stop reliving his glory days of when he was on the football team with his best buds?  So he tries to relive that [dream through his kids?](https://athletesinaction.org/underreview/how-to-destroy-your-child-through-sports)  You know that guy probably suffered the same way when he was younger.  Suffered from an abusive system that he himself will just turn around and put his kids through?  Its about as clear-cut as it gets.  

And when the [pro's speak out?](https://www.jhunewsletter.com/article/2019/11/kyrie-irving-shows-nba-needs-work-on-mental-health) Half the time they're blasted by the media.  See they don't want you to fuck with their paycheck and if even the pros are struggling then the whole damn system gets called into question.

That would be a whole lot worse for them...  But don't worry they're already a [step ahead](https://www.businessinsider.com/nfl-concussions-cover-up-new-york-times-2016-3#:~:text=A%20report%20from%20The%20New,head%20trauma%20in%20professional%20football.)  See any time the issue comes up, they can just downplay the issue.  

Sports will bring you [great benefits.](https://www.electricireland.com/news/article/10-great-benefits-of-playing-sport)  But, you know, maybe we could just go out and get some exercise in other areas that aren't so damaging.  Go hit the gym, lift some weights, practice a bit of yoga, and go for runs.  You don't have to make it a hostile competition.  Maybe just a friendly rivalry.  

A friendly rivalry.

I forget what that feels like these days.  Every time I pick up a basketball a cold chill rolls down my back thinking of all the shit I experienced.  Its like a wave of trauma.  

All the rivalries I knew were cutthroat.  I knew this guy who hated me in high school that went to a different school than me.  Shit, I hated him too.  And in a lot of ways we all hated each other when we went to different schools.  Just...  Hell I don't know all I saw was a name and a label.  The worst thing those guys ever did to me was win a game against my team.  And yet we're programmed to hate each other.  The student sections would always be yelling profanity at the players.  They'd single them out and call them horrible things.  All these kids who never really worked at anything, shouting down players who worked every day at something for not being good enough.  The best you could do is ignore them. 

----------------

My nephew's gonna be going into high school soon and he's a promising young soccer player.  I can't help him much with that, but I do some conditioning stuff with him.  Problem is I'm already hearing rumors of the soccer coach being just as big of a dick as the high school coach I dealt with back in the day.  And I don't know what to do, because if I try to call that out then I'm effecting a ton of people.  I'm potentially effecting my nephew's future playing time because politics plays a *huge* role in high school sports.  So the incentive is to shutup.  And worse than that, I'd have to deal with the beating drums of parents of other players who love the coach.  

The problem is, of course, that I'm already starting to see it take a toll on my nephew.  I don't want him to go down the same path I did, but try getting through to his mother and try telling him its in his best interest to quit a sport that could land him scholarships.  The option to go to college makes it all justified.  

Let me remind you this issue is systemic and while people are speaking up about it, you're far more likely to be shut down as soon as you open your mouth.

2020-08-01 02:26:48,"Hey r/Menslib, what’s your experience with not wanting children?","A female friend of mine recently got the Ol’ Snip, and it has got me thinking over the past few days. Prior to her surgery, she had shared that she made this whole damn binder in order to try and convince doctors to sign off and let her get her tubes tided or however they’re doing it. 

Obviously, that’s insane. Nobody should have to write an essay on why they want a certain procedure done.

And there’s been varying reactions to her decision from her social circles. Most of our friends tend to be pretty progressive so her personal decisions don’t really matter to most, but there’s been the occasional person asking “Do you think you’ll regret it?”, etc, etc.

And so it got me thinking: what’re your experiences with not having children? Either socially or medically? How do you think men are seen in the context of fatherhood today, do you think there’s some coded “manliness” to being a father? 

I myself am an early twenties dude with no expectations or desires for children anytime soon, and I’ve noticed that a helluva lot of people don’t pay that a second thought.

2020-07-31 07:45:53,I think I finally figured out my problem with height...,"Hey everyone! This is my first post on r/MensLib, and just from reading some posts you guys seem like a very open minded and constructive group. I’m glad that these issues are being brought up and discussed in a civil manner.

Anyways, I’m a guy and I’m 5’6. I’ve always had a problem with my height and didn’t know why, but recently I was thinking at work and figured it out. It’s not about relationships, it’s about perceived status. I don’t care about being short at all on paper, it doesn’t make me feel small or weak or not masculine, it just doesn’t. One of my friends who’s about 6 feet tall has a telescope and he was looking into it and I asked if I could take a look and he casually said “Here let me lower it” and lowered it so I didn’t have to get on the tip of my toes, and guess what? It made me feel great. It made me really appreciate his kindness and that he didn’t say it in a jeering or cocky manner. It didn’t make me feel bad or short or weak, it made me feel good.

My problem with height is that it has some type of perceived “badness” to it. If you were to go up to a guy and say “Wow you’re really tall!” they’d smile and say thank you and feel good about themselves, but if you went up to a guy and said “Wow, you’re really short!” he would probably feel self conscious and be upset. I wish that height were seen as more of something like skin tone or hair color or eye color. If I went up to anyone and said “Wow your eyes are really blue/green/brown” they wouldn’t feel better or worse depending on the color. I don’t mind one bit that women typically don’t find height attractive, they can have preferences for height just like how I have preferences for thin women with light skin. When I say I like thin women with light skin I’m not making fun of their weight or skin color, I’m just giving a preference. There are definitely women that want a guy to only be a couple inches taller than them so they don’t feel like they’re constantly being dominated, like my girlfriend. I’ve never had trouble getting girls so I should have no reason to dislike my height.

I hope that in the future people start to understand that height is not good or bad, it just makes us different. I hope that parents won’t make their kids feel bad when they aren’t growing as fast as their peers, or point out that every kid is taller than them. Being short is only as bad as society makes, it shouldn’t be a disability as much as something that makes us unique.",True,58,0.95,36,,/r/MensLib/comments/i0wz8j/i_think_i_finally_figured_out_my_problem_with/,ach345

2020-07-30 21:52:32,Teaching men not to r*pe,"I got in a heated discussion with some of my bros about this topic. I know it’s a bit outdated discussion but I fail to see why this is such a controversial statement. 

1) “majority of men know not to rape” so if it’s a graded test it’s an easy class. I mean what’s the wrong with getting an easy A? And the worst thing is that maybe you’re bored for a couple of hours. 

2) “discussions around consent are hard.” A majority of parents are having a hard time discussing sex with their children even though they do it (https://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/newsroom/press-releases/half-all-teens-feel-uncomfortable-talking-their-parents-about-sex-while-only-19-percent-parents). Why not let boys be open with each other? I mean crack open a cold one and let boys hash it out.

3) “guys sharing feelings is a result of feminist doctrine making men into pussies”. Okay? How is it more feminine to ask for consent than for a person to ask for a glass of water? Politeness is not a feminine trait, it’s a sign of being well-raised. 

4) “some women likes men who take charge, why are we ignoring them?” yes, and some women like to peg their partner. Doesn’t mean you shouldn’t talk about it first. 

5) “making sure she has said yes isn’t sexy/kills the mood”. (This is a vent) you know what’s really not sexy? Being a registered sex offender. Or just the fact that some girl out there may think you’ve fucking raped her??? I mean my fucking God. Why is it so damn important to feel like you’re in a 50 shades of gray-movie that you’re willing to take that chance? AND how does it kill the mood? You’re so attractive that when she has 5 seconds to think about it she’d still fuck you? How is that a bad thing?

2020-07-30 08:13:16,Actual legit challenges for dating as a guy interested in women,"So following up on  [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/hzsywy/we_need_to_draw_a_bright_line_between/) I got to thinking about there is value in talking about and thinking through the legitimate challenges and difficulties that guys who want to date women face, without conflating those challenges with issues about consent or using those challenges to excuse bad or criminal behavior by guys.  Because while people often do conflate them, I do think that they can be distinguished.  Now, many if not most of these challenges are really side effects of sexism and patriarchy and as a result 1) men should not presume that they have it worse off than women and 2) ultimately the structual answer to these questions is to dismantle patriarchy. BUT I don't think ""don't date until patriarchy is dismantled"" is a realistic solution.  On the other hand learning to navigate these challenges in an ethical way can make a small contribution to making the dating world  less shity place for men and the women they date. 

Before I get into specifics, just by way of background I am a mid 30s straight cis guy living in a big US city.  I would say I have a pretty positive dating life and while I do find a lot of the below frustrating, on net I feel like I can navigate these issues. BUT, prior to my mid 20s I was completely clueless about how to take initiative in dating, which means I barely ever did.  And I found the process of figuring it out to be frequently baffling and frustrating. This mostly took the form of realizing way after the fact that I missed signals that someone was interested, going on dates that I thought went fine but not getting a second, and having a lot of anxiety about ""making a move""

&#x200B;

* Men are expected to be the initiators and for most people being the initiator throughout a social interaction is uncomfortable

For a variety of reasons that are mostly related to sexism women are socialized not to be the initiators of sexual or romantic relationships with men.  That means men are the ones expected to do it. But ""initiating"" is not a one time thing. A sexual or romantic relationship of whatever kind typically invoves several junctures where the expectation is that the man will do the initiating.  This is not how other social interactions work.  If we think about platonic friendships going from stranger to friend involves several junctures where one person or the other has to take initiative to move the relationship forward, but usually both people each take some of those steps.  But in a heterosexual romantic or sexual relationship, at least at the outset, the man is usually expected to ask for the phone number, propose going on date, suggest the first kiss,  suggest going somewhere private at some point, etc etc.  Being the one to do that at each juncture is not naturally comfortable for most people, and can present an emotional road block that guys have to get over.  

* There aren't set norms about the pacing of dating, everyone has different expectations yet it is taboo to talk about

As mentioned above, initiating in a way that ensures consent is a baseline. But initiating in any fashion, including through seeking verbal consent to do something, is not always socially appropriate. Some of this is not much of an issue because it is obvious. If a woman shows up on a coffee date with me I should not suggest, 15 minutes in that we go to the bathroom and have sex.  BUT not all situations are so clear cut, and people have vastly different expectations about the pacing of dating and various physical and sexual ""firsts.""  Some people think sex on the first date is fine, some people don't kiss until the 3rd date.  However, it also is not considered a normal topic of discussion on a first date.   And while it is fine to request consent to something and be turned down, generally you want to be in the ball park of ""this is something I might reasonably  expect you might want.""  

* Not only are women socialized to not initiate, they are often socialized to not express too much interest which makes it more difficult to know when and how to initiate on a date

As a result of the above, guys who ARE concerned about consent will use social cues not as a substitute for consent, but as a cue for when asking for consent is liekly to get a yes or at least not to seem out of place.  But not everyone is equally good at social cues and in some cases women feel reluctant to make their social cues too obvious, because showing too much interest is sometimes stigmatized, and because predatory or abusive men might use that show of interest against them down the line as an excuse for their behavior. To be 100% clear, straight men, including straight men who want to date ethically, are not the primary people hurt by this dynamic. But it does lead to a side effect that men often feel clueless about their date's level of interest and therefore feel very uncertain about where to take things.

* women are also socialized not to provide negative feedback, leading to men being baffled about where a date went wrong

Again I want to preface this with: this phenomenon is caused by sexism and men should realize that even if it leads to frustrations in dating, men are not the primary victims here.  It is often the case that women are reluctant to show their displeasure at behavior on a date or express why they might reject a guy.  This is in part because men often react badly to this, and the best thing to do is seem friendly and agreeable, end the date politely, and then decline another date.  This is all sensible and reasonable behavior but it does have the side effect of sometimes leaving men clueless as to why a date went wrong, which can often be due to an easily correctable bad habit like talking too much, being overly blunt, etc.  

&#x200B;

Anyway, I just thought that getting the ball rolling on this could help people sort out their own dating issues.  If you find  dating frustrating, does this help? anything to add? If you feel like you have navigated these issues well, any wise words? And of course anyone who isn't a straight man who wants to chime in please do so.",True,656,0.96,525,,/r/MensLib/comments/i0bxso/actual_legit_challenges_for_dating_as_a_guy/,Jon_S111

I have been thinking about the current domestic abuse trial between Amber Heard and Johnny Depp.
It is awful, hearing what allegedly happened between them, it is so toxic.

However, I have been wondering, I personally think this could be a large step in the right direction for male victims of domestic abuse. There is still a huge stigma attached to men who suffer from domestic violence, so as a result, so many stay silent. Its horrible that these poor men can speak out of fear of not being believed.

I have been thinking that perhaps seeing a man who is seen as so strong and the 'ideal man' can suffer from such atrocities, maybe more men will come forward about their abuse? 'If it can happen to Johnny Depp, it could happen to me.'

What do you think? I'd love to hear people's views.
I also am very aware that the trial is still on-going, and that no final decisions have been made yet.",True,1247,0.96,175,,/r/MensLib/comments/i00ozy/the_trial_of_johnny_depp_and_amber_heard/,motail1990

And there seemed to be a special disdain for cats as they tended to symbolize the cat lady, the woman dying alone, no man, no kids.  But now, I'm seeing so many videos of men proudly displaying their love and affection for their pets.  One of my favorites is (this man and his cats.)[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nKi_01sGuR8].  

There are a lot of things men have been robbed of enjoying due to pressure to display the ""masculine"" persona that didn't allow for anything remotely resembling the feminine. And it makes me happy to see men be able to enjoy things they once felt cut off from.

I'd like to hear what aspects of manhood that's being challenged/changed that you enjoy seeing.

2020-07-30 09:44:05,Consent and Unwanted Sexual Attention,"There's been two recent posts on this sub ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/hxu2f5/can_we_kill_this_myth_of_the_suave_guy_that_just/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/hzsywy/we_need_to_draw_a_bright_line_between/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)) discussing the importance of consent.  They generated some good conversation, and most people seem to agree that if a person iniates sex, they are responsible for ensuring they receive verbal consent beforehand.

But I think this discussion fails to recognize an big area of worry and confusion for men outside iniating sex.

**What ought our norms to be for iniating physical contact?**  I'm talking about a kiss when you feel like it's the right moment, a hand on a back or thigh when you're trying to turn the heat up, etc.  Should we always expect some form of unambiguous consent before taking these actions, or is this an inherently grey area that will always be context dependent, and which is too complex and varied for any universal rules to apply?

We have recently become more aware the magnitude of unwanted sexual attention women too often receive, and men too often perpetrate.  By definition, any form of sexual touch without consent has potential to be sexual assault or harassment.  Of course, a kiss or a hand on the back are not the things that most people are talking about when they call attention to these issues...but still, most men do not want to risk their actions ever being the type that a reasonable person might call sexual assault or harassement.

Just to make myself abundantly clear, I am *not* referring to sex, nor any more extreme forms of sexual touch.  Rather, I'm interested in the more minor forms of touch that men are often expected to initiate, but around which there is very little expectation - perhaps even an ""anti-expectation"" if you will - to ask ""can I do this?""

**Edit:**

Not a ton of comments, but still some good discussion.

Because, obviously, I'm right about everything, I want to say - I have not been convinced by any arguments for a concrete set of rules for initiating physical contact.  However, it does seem that we could decrease the amount of unwanted attention women receive, and alleviate some of the confusion men feel, by 1) getting rid of the norm that men initiate everything, and 2) promoting greater awareness of others' comfort when it comes to physical contact.",True,31,0.89,34,,/r/MensLib/comments/i0db7y/consent_and_unwanted_sexual_attention/,
2020-07-30 00:04:27,How to talk to an old friend about his attitude towards women,"I'm going to have a conversation with an old friend of mine because he's recently been coming across as creepy to my female friends. I'm not 100% sure how to have this conversation and any advice would be really helpful.

The dude is a bit weird and generally socially awkward to begin with but he has been exhibiting some behaviours (which have led to my girlfriend refusing to be around him until I talk to him) including but not limited to:

* Making inappropriate sexual comments.
* Bothering a girl for a date for a whole year after she made out with him one time.
* Implying he was going to make a pass at a female freelancer he had hired and then when called out on it just did not understand why that would be inappropriate.
* Generally talking about women like they are an opportunity/potential girlfriend/potential sexual partner.
* Being dismissive of/making fun of women he does not see as attractive.
* Having a full blown angry rant about women posting selfies online(?)

I've also been told by female friends that he generally comes off as desperate in a way that makes his  seem predatory and intimidating.

I think he is genuinely a good guy and my girlfriend agrees but he really needs an attitude change if we are going to continue to be friends.  He has been struggling with his mental health the last few years so I am trying to be conscious of not making this conversation sound like an attack. He is very lonely, and I am certain that his lack of female attention is 100% down to his attitude (he is a very talented, tall and good looking guy). I really want him to come away from this and really examine his behaviour. How can I help him without just lecturing him and tearing him down?

1. A person initiating a sexual act has the absolute burden of obtaining clear affirmative consent before doing so.  Any supposed poor communication skills on the part of the non-initiating partner is not in fact a justification for not recieving affirmative consent.  If as a result of a partner's poor communication skills you genuinely cannot tell if they are consenting the solution is to seek further clarification or to just drop the matter and not attempt to initiate.  
2. Consent is the baseline of positive sexual encounters, but it is not sufficient on its own to lead to positive and fulfilling sexual encounters.  There is plenty of perfectly consensual bad sex that is often the result of lack of communication. In this context ""communication is a two way street and the responsibility of both people"" makes more sense to discuss, BUT it needs to be clear when we talk about this that we are specifically talking about consensual encounters.",True,752,0.98,321,,/r/MensLib/comments/hzsywy/we_need_to_draw_a_bright_line_between/,Jon_S111

Please join us on Tuesday, August 4th at 4PM Eastern (1PM Pacific) as we host Dr. Kirk Honda for an Ask Me Anything to answer your questions about mental health, masculinity, and therapy. 

>Dr. Kirk Honda has been a practicing therapist since 1996, a professor of couple and family therapy since 1998, and a podcaster/YouTuber since 2008. His podcast, Psychology In Seattle, has produced over 1000 episodes on various psychological topics. More recently, his YouTube channel has become popular due to his reaction videos to reality TV shows.

I first found out about Dr. Honda through his long running [podcast](https://psychologyinseattle.squarespace.com/) & [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/PsychologyInSeattle) show called Psychology in Seattle where he has discussed many issues related to men and masculinity, specifically where masculinity intersects with mental health and the unique challenges that men face when seeking treatment. 

One of his most important episodes, in my opinion, is his [10 Tips on Counseling Men](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL_iy1ou7co) and the article he's written on the same topic [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OOwpU23DmZ3U5-yzj_PoMjpPvhj1SvRX/view?usp=sharing). In this podcast & article, Kirk talks about the common pitfalls therapists run into with some male clients and how to break through cultural stereotypes that hold men back from emotions and vulnerability. 

I'd also recommend checking out some other episodes that he has done on the topics of [Male Oppression](https://youtu.be/iOJ5LfuuoOM), [Men's Issues](https://youtu.be/GbKBeYdPKIs), [Men's Shame](https://youtu.be/oCQ7iEbCFEc), as well as getting into the psychology of how men are lead into the [incel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFbUoS48NYg) and [MGTOW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnIWhvlc5YU) movements.",True,330,0.98,8,moderator,/r/MensLib/comments/hzqeh6/ama_announcement_dr_kirk_honda_therapist/,anhedonious_rex

2020-07-28 15:36:29,"It is accepted as fact that generally, men commit more crime than women. Perhaps we should start asking why?","As the title says, it is pretty much common knowledge that men generally commit more crime than women.

Now I'm curious of **why**. Why is it that men do generally commit more crime than women?

There isn't gonna be a lot of sources in this, it's more of me giving my theories as to why men do commit more crimes and inviting discussion of a topic that isn't talked about too much.

My theory is, that it's a mix of toxic gender expectations for men (men are supposed to bend over backwards to provide for their family), poverty (intertwined with the provider role, lower income households might struggle with paying their monthly bills, so men, generally viewed as providers, turn to crime, specifically burglary or robberies, so they can make some extra money), cultural expectations of men settling disputes with aggression, and lack of support for mental health issues that men may face.

It could also be that maybe, the ""crime/prison gap"" between men and women isn't as big as we think it is. Specifically when talking about why there's more men in prison, [it's because men and women tend to commit different types of crimes](https://law.jrank.org/pages/1250/Gender-Crime-Differences-between-male-female-offending-patterns.html). Women are more likely to commit 'white collar' crimes (writing bad cheques, fraud, shoplifting/small scale theft). Those crimes often get probation or other punishments that don't involve jail time. In a lot of cases, they don't even get reported to the police at all; the woman simply gets banned from the store fired from the job, etc. Also when the same crime is committed in both cases, [women do generally get less prison time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentencing_disparity#History)

Another part could be the lack of a male role model in the perpetrator's lives. Teenagers from fatherless homes [are more likely to turn to crime](https://www.mnpsych.org/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_dailyplanetblog%26view%3Dentry%26category%3Dindustry%2520news%26id%3D54) than teens from two-parent households. Add that with the fact that [most primary school teachers are women](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7672738/3-04102016-BP-EN.pdf/9f0d2d04-211a-487d-87c3-0a5f7d6b22ce), which doesn't help the lack of male role models. 

The ""crime gap"" may also exist because crimes that women commit are less likely to be discovered. Women are less likely to be targeted for a random pat down, and are therefore less likely to be found carrying contraband. Women stopped for a traffic violation are less likely to be pressured for a full car search than men (especially men of colour!)

[Men are also more likely to be repeat offenders than women](https://law.jrank.org/pages/1250/Gender-Crime-Differences-between-male-female-offending-patterns.html). Prison culture surely does not help that fact.

Add in a severely overwhelmed child protection system, and in the cases that do go to trial, a judge often gives a shorter sentence (or a sentence to be served in the community) in order to keep the children from going into foster care.

Obviously there also can be other reasons (the rush of adrenaline or things like that).

Now I'm passing the question off to you: What do you think? Why do you think men tend to commit more crimes than women?",True,972,0.96,282,,/r/MensLib/comments/hzacvk/it_is_accepted_as_fact_that_generally_men_commit/,CuriousOfThings

2020-07-27 12:31:30,Nat from *Nat’s what I reckon* as evidence being masculine is not the problem,"Nat (no surname) is an Australian comedian and heavy-metal drummer. And he absolutely [looks like](https://theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/29/nats-what-i-reckon-the-sweary-ranty-youtuber-whos-become-an-isolation-cooking-sensation) the stereotype that likely came to mind when you read ‘heavy-metal drummer’.

He’s also got an ocker-as-hell accent (linguists would say he has a Broad Australian accent) and is utterly [bogan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogan) in his demeanour; complete with the ‘uses the word *fuck* like a comma’ approach to swearing that fits the stereotype non-Australians have about Australians.

And, during the recent Covid-19 lockdowns, he repurposed his [long-standing YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/channel/UCEFW1E8QzP-hKxjO2Rj68wg) and took to making some of the most entertaining cooking videos you’ll ever see. (At least, I think so.)

The recipes are all about not using packet or jar sauces, and all about using fresh incredients. And his approach is both unapologetically masculine and just as unapologetically encouraging.

As he says at the end of [Quarantine Spirit Risotto](https://youtube.com/watch?v=MSI4ZHVSatw)

> Don’t be a grub and cook shit out of a packet. Fucking make it
> yourself. You’re more talented than you think you are.

(I also like that, after the end-card, this video shows Nat vacuuming up the kitchen. He’s as blokey as they come, and he also does the housework.)

At the beginning of [Eggs-istential Crisis](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ULtWi4ert94), in which he teaches how to poach an egg, he says

> Today we broach the very delicate breakfast subject of the egg. Eggs
> have this special way of making you feel like a real piece of shit
> when you fuck them up. They’re a bit of a metaphor for our mental
> health at times. Their delicate, a pain in the arse, but if you work
> on it, you get a little bit better at managing it.

And, to finish up this video, he closes with:

> Give it a crack, I reckon you’ll nail it. Beautiful egg for some
> beautiful champions.

At the end of [Rice Rice Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tWm99DWYag) he finishes with two key points:

> Remember, you’re a bloody champion. And cold rice. See you next week
> champions.

*Champion* is, in fact, his default way of addressing the audience. Watch his videos and you’ll get called a champion multiple times per episode.

Nat gets called no-nonsense, and that’s not incorrect. But no-nonsense can and is used to denote some pretty nasty stuff. And he’s anything but nasty.

The episode that really brought home the worth of his approach to me is his collaboration over Zoom with Machine Gun Kelly: [Burning breakfast with Machine Gun Kelly](https://youtube.com/watch?v=C_uo-ZAIeZM).

Kelly has enjoyed enormous success in many arenas. But it appears he’s not especially confident in the kitchen. And Nat encourages Kelly in his particularly ocker way, and Kelly delights multiple times as he succeeds at doing something new (to Kelly).

We code way too many things as masculine or feminine. And, as a consequence, we tend not to see the generally universal nature of these things. Nat is empathetic as fuck. But, if you code empathy as feminine, you won’t see Nat’s approach as the empathy it is.

And if you code Nat’s masculine-as-hell demeanor as wholly about strength or dominance or the exercise of power, you won’t see how encouraging and open and even gentle he is.

Toxic masculinity is absolutely a thing. And it’s an enormous problem, perhaps even the core problem from which pretty much all the others flow.

Don’t, however, let your efforts to understand and deal with the poison mislead you in to thinking masculinity is the problem.",True,1515,0.98,103,,/r/MensLib/comments/hyll2v/nat_from_nats_what_i_reckon_as_evidence_being/,ruchenn

I'm saying this as someone who benefits from some, but not all, of those above examples. No, I'm not going to tell you which ones I benefit from, and that's the point. If someone challenges your sexuality, or questions you about a mental health condition, you don't have to answer them. Instead, you can just simply inform them that's it's not polite to ask such questions publicly.

A lot of people who don't have these privileges might not feel comfortable, or even safe, admitting as much in public forums such as social media. Aside from outright lying, their only viable response to such questions is silence. If the people who do have those privileges aren't also being silent in solidarity, then that silence is just as telling as openly acknowledging that lack of privilege.

I know this isn't explicitly a case of men's issues, so maybe /r/MensLib isn't the greatest place to post this, but I do feel there's enough intersectionality with men's issues for this to be relevant here.

Learning to accept myself for who I am and focussing on living a healthy life instead of trying to be 'thinner' by unhealthy means or wishing I had a different nose has been an enormous boost to my confidence and self-appreciation. A big part of how I achieved this is by following women online who promote self acceptance and body positivity - Jameela Jamil, Lizzo, Amy Schumer etc. surrounding myself with positive people who remind me of what is important when I feel like shit.

At this point, I'm reflecting on my partner and his own body issues. I can imagine how difficult it is to feel worthy when every tv show or movie features someone looking like Henry Cavill or Chris Pratt - who achieve their 'money shots' by extremely unhealthy measures such as dehydration - and our society still seems to have no issue with shaming men for their bodies. My partner is constantly feeling like he needs to make a change, isn't muscular enough, and has even mentioned wanting surgery to change his face.

How often do we need to see women coming out with some form of abuse allegations against a man, that we all thought were so socially competent, charming and handsome and a real 'ladies man'? Some of these people are abusers, in the sense that they consciously and actively used abuse tactics to get their way, but a lot of these cases seem to come down to misinterpreted signals.

EDIT: So, I'm going to copy a reply here.

 

**PLEASE know that when a man is accused of physical or sexual abuse and there's no doubt that he did have contact with the woman accusing him (and therefore he can't just say 'it never happened'), the most common tactic for dispersing blame is pretending that the abuse was a 'miscommunication'. That, in and of itself, is a tactic of abuse. I'm not saying that miscommunication doesn't happen - I know several men personally that it's happened to - but be very,**

**very**

**suspicious of anyone who seems knowledgeable about women and then claims miscommunication in the face of abuse allegations.**

I need to apologize.

The use of ""miscommunication"", as an excuse for clear boundary violations, happens a lot. We need to make sure to not make it easy for people to use it as a cover for their abuse. 

I don't have anything more to say about it than that. Once again, I'm sorry.

/EDIT  

What annoys me the most is how everybody, then, tries to diagnose how he did the ""lady whispering"" bad and the 'obvious' things he should've done instead. We conveniently forget the times that we were either OK with his behavior, or the times we even used him as a role model. The truth is that there isn't a way to do it right. Ambiguity is bad communication and bad communication will always lead to casualties-especially when we're talking about sex and intimacy.

What i'm about to say is rated E, for Everybody, that means you to ladies and enbies. If it's a turnoff for you to ask or to be asked for a clarification on some things during the ""courting process""(I hate that term, is there one that's not so slimy?), then you have to be comfortable with potentially being the person that can ruin someones life.

There's no such thing as mind reading. There's less than a 0,001% chance that you're some kind of ""empath"" and those odds worsens the more strongly you believe that you are one(unless you actually done legit tests for it. But even if you are one, minimize the risk of harm by being clear with your communication).",True,940,0.9,296,,/r/MensLib/comments/hxu2f5/can_we_kill_this_myth_of_the_suave_guy_that_just/,No-Border680
2020-07-26 01:51:50,In search of positive male bonding rituals.,"For one reason or another, over the past few months I seem to have developed a craving to take up pipe smoking. Not day to day,  but to occasionally sit there, on a midsummer evening, and just rest in the garden chewing away at the lip of a gently smouldering pipe. I initially wrote this off as just a part of me wishing to live out a Bilbo/ Gandalf fantasy, but the more I felt it pressing in, the more I recognised that part of me was in a way, quite desperate for that kind of bonding scenario. Just those quiet evening spent with others, where not much is said or happens, yet connections deeper that we realise are forged. 

Now as someone who smoked from their early teens to their early twenties, but has been smoke free for the past five to six years, I’m not particularly keen to jump straight back into that kind of habit, but it did start to get me interested about what it means to create that kind of ‘space’ which can enable the kind of bonding experiences that our souls deeply crave.  Now, I feel that these primarily come from experiences that are always accessible, sure hiking some trail amongst the Himalayas would no doubt be an incredible bonding experience, but I still think its every bit as possible to hold that kind of ‘space’ over a pot of stew (even if my Le Creuset isn’t quite as impressive as Mount Everest!) 

So I just wanted to ask what peoples thoughts were, whether they have any experiences to share of these kind of experiences, or any thoughts?",True,706,0.98,153,,/r/MensLib/comments/hxqxvs/in_search_of_positive_male_bonding_rituals/,Watchful_Peregrine
2020-07-26 06:21:23,Gender and Friendships,"I didn’t want to derail the discussion in the original post, but [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/hxqxvs/in_search_of_positive_male_bonding_rituals/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) on here about male bonding got me thinking about gender and friend groups. It’s very clear my experiences aren’t the norm, even just from looking around me or from reading the comments on that post. 

The vast majority of my friends are queer, and those who aren’t are mostly women, and that definitely influences my experiences. I don’t think I’ve ever actively sought to be part of an only male or majority male group when it comes to social bonding and friendships, and those which I have been invited into have almost all been very forced and uncomfortable - both in terms of my own discomfort and others’ discomfort with the presence as an unmasculine/gender nonconforming queer guy (I’m not and never have been the ‘acceptable’ kind of queer guy who is able to pass as straight; I’m bisexual and even when I was dating women, I was either inescapably and obviously queer or too guarded and closed off to form any type of friendships at all). 

So I wanted to put some questions forward for the guys in this sub, to try and understand others’ perspectives and experiences better. 

1) What does the term “male bonding” mean to you?
2) Do you bond differently with your male friends and your female friends? What sort of things do you do together that you would consider part of that bonding?
3) What’s the gender makeup of the groups you feel most comfortable/most yourself in?
4) Do gender roles and expectations affect how you experience friendships or who you’re friends with, and if so, how?",True,46,0.94,21,,/r/MensLib/comments/hxvgb9/gender_and_friendships/,dxmxmlxx

2020-07-25 01:34:22,Discussion: Is it important to raise awareness of men’s issues?,"This post is inspired by some encouraging conversations I had recently with friends who were not aware of the gender disparities in [homelessness](https://endhomelessness.org/demographic-data-project-gender-and-individual-homelessness/), [criminal sentencing](https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx), and basically anything outside of identity issues, ie the “man box”. I am passionate about these more materialist discrepancies, both because of personal connections with men who suffer as well as the immense reach they have, affecting many millions of people drastically.

Anyway, I brought the subject up among my group of progressive friends; two women, and two men, including me. Homelessness in our city is widespread, and I commented on the gendered nature of homelessness, especial those who live unsheltered. I was surprised to hear that none of them have heard the issue approached in a gendered way, and there was a bit of awkwardness initially, as we compared it to the wage gap we have heard much more about in the media and our friend groups. 

However by the end of the convo, everyone expressed gratefulness to me for bringing it up, and said that they were just not aware that there were gender gaps in institutions like criminal sentencing which historically and consistently discriminate against men. We discussed the nature of social justice movements and how men’s issues could be brought to light without infringing on feminist discourse, or BLM, or others. Our conclusion was that men’s issues were somewhat sidelined because society can only focus on so many things at once, and there is too much complexity in considering men as privileged in some contexts while also being victims of institutional discrimination. 

This is a hard pill for me to swallow. We shouldn’t avoid serious issues because the narrative around men is too simplistic. I also believe that it is not women’s job to advocate for men, so we must have the courage to do so regardless of what judgement we may receive.  I think many men are afraid to bring these issues up for fear of being labelled an MRA, fear that the discussion alone will be a net harm to feminism, or having internalized the expectation of male hyperagency to the point where issues which mostly affect men are viewed as inherently less important.

The conversation left me somewhat discouraged that educated, social justice aware people could have no prior knowledge of pretty fundamental issues, but also feeling somewhat hopeful that they were so receptive. Obviously anybody who wants equality is an ally in this fight, so I believe society could quickly progress if more people were educated by seeing the stats (or just paying attention to who is visibly homeless on the street). I also think this could be a huge inroad for the less progressive men in society to start engaging with feminist discourse, because they will feel like issues that affect them are treated with equal importance.

**tldr: I wanted to bring this discussion to menslib to hear your thoughts. What can we do to productively bring attention to men’s issues (especially those outside of just social expectations*)? Should it be a priority to spread awareness in the first place? And finally, what have been your experiences when discussing these issues?**
 
*I am aware that social expectations of men have causal relationships with some materialist discrepancies, but we need to directly address things like homelessness, and not just hope that deconstructing male hyperagency will bring society to an indirect fix.

2020-07-24 07:40:01,"""Man Up and Take It"": Study finds people more likely to perceive men as causing harm, women as receiving harm","A paper titled [""Man Up and Take It""](https://scottbarrykaufman.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Reynolds-et-al.-2020-1.pdf) just came out in the social science journal [Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/organizational-behavior-and-human-decision-processes). It examines six experiments where participants judged scenarios involving men and women as perpetrators or victims of harm in the workplace. It found that:

1. **People associate men with causing harm, and women with receiving harm, when all other factors are held equal.**
2. **People tend to perceive the pain of a woman victim as greater than the pain of a male victim, all else held equal.**
3. **People tend to consider harm done to women to be more intentional, morally bad, and/or worthy of punishment, than harm done to men, all else held equal.**

The experiments examined by the paper took place in a variety of countries (the US, China, Norway, and Canada). This does not mean the biases it found are not socially constructed, but it does suggest they are not limited to a specific culture.

The paper's authors think these finding are significant, saying:

>The biased application of moral typecasting may be used to justify unequal attributions of blame, generating disparities in punishment and aid. Crucially, the current findings suggest that identical transgressions will be differentially adjudicated based solely on the gender of the parties involved. Moreover, our results suggest that the moral domain is especially likely to evoke disparate gendered assumptions, indicating that some of the most egregious forms of gender discrimination may manifest in contexts involving harm.

But, crucially, they *do not* see this as contradicting the common view that gender roles are bad for women:

>It is worth noting that our studies examined only one side of the biased application of moral typecasting. We demonstrated that in situations involving harm, women are more easily typecast as victims than men, which may lead women to receive disproportionate levels of concern or support in response to their suffering. **If women are more easily categorized as patients than agents, this biased typecasting may simultaneously disadvantage women in their pursuit of leadership roles**, where agency is required for reaching decisions, delegating tasks, and garnering respect \[...\]. Indeed, a wide body of research has examined how benevolent sexism—an ideological belief that women require care and protection from men \[...\]—harms women’s access to challenging workplace opportunities that promote growth \[...\] and impairs perceptions of women’s competence and suitability for managerial roles \[...\].

They also state that one of the reasons men are perceived as perpetrators of harm may be because they so often *do* harm others:

>this bias \[to see men as perpetrators and women as victims\] is not independent from true base rates of harm or gender stereotypes. Rather, we contend that harm base rates, such as the greater male perpetration of physical aggression and workplace bullying \[...\], contribute to this application of moral typecasting, such that men more closely fit the cognitive prototype of perpetrator.

**So, thoughts?**

**Do these results resonate; do they describe something people feel to be real? Or not?**

**If these results are describing something real, what should we do with them? How do these findings fit into the feminist movement and our effort to create a more just society?**

2020-07-23 14:16:59,"Some ruminations on ‘Enlightened paternity leave scheme one pathway to gender equality’, written by Josh Bornstein and published in The Sydney Morning Herald","The article ‘[Enlightened paternity leave scheme one pathway to gender equality](https://smh.com.au/lifestyle/gender/enlightened-paternity-leave-scheme-one-pathway-to-gender-equality-20200722-p55ed1.html)’ makes the argument that

> The most direct route to achieve [gender equality] progress is to
> more equally distribute the responsibility for childcare between men
> and women.

And the *tl;dr* version of Bornstein’s argument is that the single most effective policy change we could introduce on this front is to provide paid parental leave and simultaneously require men to take a substantial portion of said leave.

I have experiences and thoughts to bring to bear on this front.

My partner and I aren’t a heternormative pair, so our experience isn’t as directly applicable, but we both spent years as the primary care-giver to the children we raised. Sometimes it was me as the mostly-at-home parent. Sometimes it was them.

Also, we raised them in what you might call a semi-communal environment. We have a family home, but our shared community areas are accessible without us having to leave ‘our’ space. And this community space is essential to the business of living. The laundry is communal, for example. As is the clothes-line. So is the workshop, which we use to make and repair things. And so is the play/leisure area.

Further, our communal space is accessible to every house in our community without anyone having to leave our shared space. No road-crossing or even yard-leaving required. Which results in having people — especially children — in your house who don’t officially live in your house being so common we’ve developed shorthand text messaging habits to communicate things like who’s been fed where, and who’s clothes are in who’s current laundry load. (Back in the days before text messaging we had similarly quick phone calls or even shouted four word sentences; eg ‘Sarah’s eating here Rachel!’)

The logistics of our child-raising mirrored the logistics of most of our community’s child-raising. No one parent in any household was always the primary care-giver.

And the impact of all this on said parents is absolutely important. Fathers who’ve spent months and years as primary care-givers to babies and small children and months and years as (in effect) primary household managers are absolutely more well-rounded and complete human beings. And mothers who’ve partnered up with fathers who’ve spent months and years as primary care-givers are similarly enhanced.

Much of the discussion about men and parenting focuses on how deep, day-to-day-to-day-to-day, in the trenches, parenting changes men’s perspectives and presumptions. And this is absolutely to be expected. Going against norms in a way that will likely lower your status or social standing makes people pay a lot of attention to the particular going-against-the-norm behaviour.

But it’s worth paying attention to other consequences as well. Because, at least in the experiences I’ve had and the experiences I’ve seen happen around me, unpacking heteronormative patriarchal narratives through lived experience like this makes women who are romantically and sexually attracted to men re-examine and change their ideas about what makes for attractive masculinity. A lot. Even for women who’d long wearied of ‘traditionally masculine’ men.

Put another way: if men weary of the traditional masculinity straight-jacket who are also romantically and sexually attracted to women want to be understood as more attractive, do the hard work that shows women how much more attractive your non-traditional masculinity really is (and believe me, it really is more attractive). Because the proof of every pudding is absolutely in the eating.

The impact of this on our kids is also worth noting. They have, for example, a reflexive tendency to bounce really hard off various still-parts-of-the-cultural-zeitgeist sexisms. The idea that women are ‘naturally more caring’ or that fathers ‘must be providers’, for example, strikes all our kids as such obvious bullshit that they find it hard to argue the point. Because, to them, the ideas are so patently stupid it seems dumb to even argue them.

I don’t want to pretend our approach made for (or makes for) instant and permanent paradise. Because it absolutely doesn’t.

We still argue and fight. And we still worry about everything. And we are all still scarily subject to the vagaries of unethical Capitalism. And our kids — and now our grandkids — still play up and occasionally make stupid decisions and do stupid things.

But men spending months and years doing the hard, practical, daily work of raising children and cooking meals, and cleaning toilets, and keeping the peace, and managing and tracking and planning for all the comings and goings, and generally keeping households ticking over, absolutely makes a huge difference when it comes to what I think of as boots-on-the-muddy-fucking-ground feminism and gender equality.",True,114,0.97,9,,/r/MensLib/comments/hwam7g/some_ruminations_on_enlightened_paternity_leave/,ruchenn

Growing up I kept feeling incredibly out of place around groups of straight boys who obsessed over girls all the time (and I still kind of do). I had a lot of girls who were friends in elementary school but i don't recall ever having crushes on them. I remember in 7th grade, when a boy had spread a rumour around my school that I liked one of the prettiest girls in the grade, I felt incredibly offended to the point of wanting to cry instead of feeling flattered.

I remembered in the 9th and 10th grades respectively feeling uncharacteristically giddy and excited from being around two boys who had qualities I lacked (tall, handsome, confident, athletic). I mostly just admired them from afar and I didn't really do anything to act upon these feelings because I didn't understand if what I actually had was considered a romantic crush or if I was simply just admiring them as people.

I was raised very religious (Charismatic Christian). I've always been taught that the Bible is the clear Word of God and it is specified pretty clearly in there that being gay is an abomination and that gays are going to hell, and that had led me to feel like I was broken for years. My family are also pretty staunchly homophobic. It's made worse with the fact that I have a distant relationship with my father and my family/people around me could use that against me as the cause of why I became this way. One of my uncles and aunts died in 2016 and 2017 respectively and I see that as God's punishment for me being gay. I still want to hold on to my religion but reconciling my faith and sexuality is proving to be difficult. As I've grown up and exposed myself to more of the world, I don't see gay people as evil like I've been raised to but a lot of that negativity is still internalized within me due to my upbringing.

I hated myself (and still kind of do). I remember just a few months ago slapping myself in the face at least 5 times on numerous occasions whenever I masturbated to fantasies of being with another boy. I used to pray to God to turn me straight and force myself to look at pictures of naked women/women in bikinis for hours in the hopes that I can get an erection, but nothing happened. I have also done things that are deliberately harmful to my health to suppress my sexuality (not sleeping enough, eating junk food, not exercising). I did them so that my body would not produce much testosterone at all, to completely eradicate my sex drive towards other men. However, this has in turn affected my ability to function in daily life. 

A lot of gay people drown out their feelings through alcohol, drugs and sex but I did it through the internet. I'm addicted to it. I use the internet to escape real life, I browse the internet mindlessly whenever I have the time, and I do possess separate private YouTube and reddit accounts to access NSFW gay stuff, and I am addicted to an online pop culture forum where most of the members are stereotypical gay men. I thought I had to act like them to fit in but it didn't feel natural to me at all. They obsess over female pop stars and celebrity culture in general and the atmosphere is very toxic because the members are very catty and dramatic, they pit female pop stars against each other and there are a lot of misogynistic views being held, but for some reason I can't stay away from the mess. Checking up on pop culture news obsessively has made me feel alienated from real life. 

I know I have a lot of issues and I don't even know where to start dealing with them. I'm sorry I'm such a mess. If anyone has any advice please feel free to tell me what to do",True,205,0.97,37,,/r/MensLib/comments/hvufnl/my_inability_to_accept_my_sexuality_is_negatively/,AmeliorationPerso

2020-07-22 02:34:23,Reflecting and Grieving the Loss of Some Men in My Life,"I couldn't sleep last night after learning about the sudden death of leftist activist and broadcaster Michael Brooks. I'm a fan, but not super obsessed, so I started writing in attempt to figure out why I was feeling so inordinately torn up about it. This came out and I thought some folks here might appreciate or find some value in it:

&#x200B;

I’m thinking a lot lately about the unexpected, unanticipated loss of good, young men before their time. The one year anniversary of one of my best friends deaths was a few weeks ago, I’ve been rewatching a lot of Anthony Bourdain reflecting on how much his worldview impacted my own, and now the sudden unexpected death of Michael Brooks who had become a staple of providing a bit of \\catharsis and wisdom for me week to week on his show and the Majority Report which made me feel less alone. (Yes, two out of three of these relationships were para-social, but there has to still be something of value to say for public figures who qualify as healthy role models? Maybe?) What I knew or saw of all three of these men were traits I greatly admired; that I defined as a very humanist and progressive manliness. A manliness rooted in kindness and compassion for all people over the competitive hierarchies of dominance our culture more commonly defines as masculine.

I spend a lot of time thinking about how manhood and masculinity are fractured if not outright broken in our culture. I’m half way through a very slow read of *A Little Life*, which has influenced these thoughts, but this was on my mind long before starting that. Anyway... It’s hard for men to bond. It’s hard for men to be vulnerable. It’s hard for men to be tender; especially amongst other men. I often feel lonely and alienated for wanting those things out of platonic male relationships. It’s especially hard if you don’t ascribe to the modern American cultural definition of “manly”. And as such, it’s hard for me to form and maintain such relationships. This makes me feel even more lonely. I turn on the TV and see the ugliness and evil of the men who have all the power and influence in our world. It makes me feel more alienated. I see regular posts on Twitter making jokes where a lazy punchline boils down to “men are trash” in hopes of scooping up some favs and RTs. I can’t blame them. Their examples of powerful and influential men on TV are the same as mine. The people in power who subjugate, marginalize, belittle, and abuse them also happen to be men. Those men are awful and I like to think or hope our born identity is the only commonality we share. So sometimes I even give the desired fav or RT. But it doesn’t stop me, a man, from internalizing the message: “men are trash”. I feel more alone.

Of the men I mentioned, only Bourdain took his own life, but for some reason I can’t help but identify some relevance to them all dying suddenly, and young. And then I can’t help but reflect that back on the tragically high and rising suicide rates among American men. I remember calling my sister more angry than sad the day my friend died and saying “capitalism killed my friend.” Anyone who knows me well will roll their eyes and say “of course he says that”. My friend’s struggles are complicated and don’t need to be aired out publicly, nor do I have all the details, but I could set forth a pretty good argument for my thesis. But that’s not really the point.

I’m not saying this applies directly to these particular losses I’m reflecting on right now, it’s more of a thought compounding on top of grief, but patriarchy is a disease in our culture. I know it’s not a popular take on this discussion, but patriarchy is killing men too. For more on this check out Kristen Ghodsee’s excellent book *Why Women Have Better Sex Under Socialism*. A society that insists on men as “provider” in lieu of providing a social safety net for all people regardless of gender, damages everyone. The cutthroat ruthlessness of what we know as “toxic masculinity” only works to boost the power of men who are spoiled or poisoned enough to wield it as a weapon of our privilege. And because they are the ones who wield the power of influence, they become people’s definition of what a “man” is. This leaves the rest of us feeling disconnected from our culture’s definition of what “a man” is. If you don’t like it, if you think it’s ugly, or oppressive then you must not be “a man”. It’s a fact that most men are unlikely to have more than a few close friends once they reach their 30s (especially male friends). While the toxic male might surround himself with peers he does not allow the vulnerability that makes a deep and meaningful relationship. The rest of us have very little cultural definition of what healthy male relationship can look like and so we often end up alone, drowning in those images of what our culture wants manhood to look like. Some of us partner off and then often times end up making the partner bare the weight of our emotional labor. Some of us just stew in the loneliness and alienation unsure how to expel the anxious energy it forces into us, and then we are likely act on it in unhealthy ways that can sometimes be harmful to others. And saddest of all there are others who simply can’t bare the weight anymore and end things. We are lonely, and we are alienated from our work, our communities, and each other.

2020-07-22 00:58:49,Male (a)sexuality and masculinity,"With the recent interesting discussions on queerness and queer spaces in this subreddit, I thought it a good opportunity to ask for your collective wisdom about something that has been bothering me for a while: how does your sexuality relate to your sense of masculinity, and vice versa?

The background here is an essay on asexuality and masculinity that I found a short while ago: [https://goodmenproject.com/gender-sexuality/male-asexuality-and-its-challenge-to-masculinity-jvinc/](https://goodmenproject.com/gender-sexuality/male-asexuality-and-its-challenge-to-masculinity-jvinc/). In this article, the author first explicitly couples the sense of masculinity to (straight) male sexuality. She then continues to link (straight) male sexuality to: 

&#x200B;

>No matter what else has changed about how we view men and women,  masculinity and femininity, no matter how men have changed since the  1960s, one thing remains utterly the same: *successful masculinity depends heavily upon the male’s active sexuality.*  
>  
>The role of sex in masculinity performance is connected to other  important markers of successful masculinity: power, money, dominance,  and the approval of other men. 

In her defense, the author quite clearly disagrees with this view of male masculinity and challenges this by presenting male asexuals. Still, I cannot help but think she's challenging a strawman she created here: an overly simplistic and one-dimensional view of masculinity, which I found myself strongly disagreeing with.

However, I realize I have a sizable blind spot in this discussion: I am a male asexual. I don't particularly desire or want or even enjoy sex. I have tried learning all of that, and have failed enough to know that sexuality is simply not an integral part of me. To me, the idea of linking my sense of *masculinity* to my *sexuality* seems pointlessly limiting. Likewise, I dislike the notion of perceiving other men's status or success through their sexual activities. I dislike conflating *sex* with *success* at all. 

But perhaps, my personal experience only reinforces the point that the author raised in the article? I cannot speak for how straight or gay or bi men experience their sexuality, or how they relate sex to their sense of masculinity. I *think* that I do not see anything close to what the author describes among my friends, but I have been blindsided before on sexual topics.

So I am very curious: what do you think of this article? Do you agree with or recognize the view of masculinity that the author presents here? And how does your sexuality affect the way you see yourself as a man?",True,138,0.97,22,,/r/MensLib/comments/hvb4kp/male_asexuality_and_masculinity/,
2020-07-21 18:45:28,Why is masculinity so logically inconsistent?,"In my experience, modern rock music (Bands like Volbeat, I Prevail, Bring Me The Horizon, etc) seems to be viewed by society as feminine music ""real men"" can't listen to. But stuff from the 80s like AC/DC and Metallica are ""manly man music"" that ""real men"" should listen to.

Men go to comically ridiculous lengths to try hard not to ""look gay"", but you see athletes slapping each other on the ass and that's masculine for some reason.


* What's the logic to what's considered masculine?

* What's the reason for new rock bands being seen by society as feminine and old rock being seen by society as masculine?

* Why do athletes slap each other on the behind, when many of them don't do things like recycling at the same time because it's ""feminine"" and ""gay""?",True,65,0.92,37,,/r/MensLib/comments/hv57q3/why_is_masculinity_so_logically_inconsistent/,AlertCardiologist7
2020-07-20 22:52:40,Masculinity and Queerness,"I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/hu1tdx/when_gay_men_arent_queer_enough/) in r/ainbow but I am interested in this from a male liberation point of view, as well as an LGBT one. This is also part of a larger conversation I've been having IRL/FB with real people in my life, primarily trans people and cis gay people.

&#x200B;

There are several issues at play, but a big question is ""Why is masculinity treated as heterosexual/heteronormative?""

&#x200B;

The question arises in several places, both online and IRL, so I will give some examples - they are primarily spaces that are treated as, named, and constructed to be ""queer spaces"" while deliberately and intentionally making sure cis men do not have access to the space (or access is incredibly restricted) while including trans men, if we toe the party line.  

&#x200B;

1. In this above post I linked a sub on here that is doing that (Tw: slurs are apparently A THING on that sub (r/queerbdsm )
2. The Therapy Center of Philadelphia was probably not the first time I saw it, but it was the first time it came onto my radar. Reading back over it, that was in 2012, so this concern has played out over time. Originally it was the Women's Therapy Center of Philadelphia, but eight years ago they changed their name and model to be the Therapy Center of Philadelphia to be more ""inclusive"" and allow treatment and provide services to ""services to women, transgender, and gender non-conforming communities."" Basically, no cis men allowed (because cooties).
3. I have seen a number of events local-to-me that are constructed as ""queer events"" for ""women and trans people"" - thus excluding cis gay/bi/pan/ace men and also effectively coding queer as femme. I have privately spoken to several queer trans men in my social circles and this usually creates a retreat either from being out as trans (stealth) and/or a retreat into the cis queer male community (as I have mostly done).

&#x200B;

While these examples highlight trans issues primarily, I imagine that is because I am a trans man so those stand out to me. However this coding of queer as femme and masculine as heteronormative concerns me. If queer means ""women and trans people"" and by trans people they want ""femme"" (the coding of trans men as 'boys,"" ""smol,"" ""cute,"" ""protect the uwu bois"" etc is an effective way of demasculinizing trans men, coding us as female, and recreating a structure where the trans masculine needs protection from the predatory cis masculine), then that is recoding masculine as patriarchy/oppressive/heterosexual/normative and the feminine as oppressed/defiant/queer/revolutionary.

&#x200B;

It concerns me to isolate out queer cis men, in particular, and cis-performed-masculinity as unrevolutionary, unqueer, and inherently normative and/or predatory. It dually undermines the masculinity of trans men when grouping us under an umbrella of woman-adjacent and redefines queer by coding it as exclusionary to cis men. 

&#x200B;

To declare yourself a queer space - as The Therapy Center of Philadelphia does - and to deliberately make sure that cis men cannot access it is a declaration, too, that cis men are not queer and should not have access to queer spaces. When I have spoken to organizers of such spaces (and my temper grows shorter with such exclusions), they usually frame it in a ""protective"" model. The Therapy Center's protective model is clearly derived from a similar model use when they were the Women's Therapy of Center of Philadelphia in 1972 - women (and now women and trans people) need a space away from men, that is their own space, where (imply dangerous/predatory/unsafe) (cis) men cannot interfere with their care. If it is a bar night or kink event, labelled queer yet with these restrictions, it is often adjusted to something along the lines of ""women and trans people need a space to express their sexuality without (danger/predatory/unsafe) (cis) men.""

&#x200B;

Why does queer in these spaces not include gay men (who presumably are not interested in women) or asexual/aromantic men (who would be unlikely to be interested in anyone); why would it not include pansexual or bisexual men, who are also under the queer umbrella and might also need services or be interested in a date or hook up?

&#x200B;

Let me be clear: I have no issue with, say, a lesbian night at a gay bar. But to take the umbrella term ""queer"" and demand that (cis) men not use it, this is the concern. Or to create a space that you declare to be ""accountable to the queer community"" while also deliberately and purposefully excluding (cis) men, even though they, too, fall under the LGBT umbrella, this is is the concern. I suppose a related question is: why are they de-masculinizing trans men and making us woman-adjacent in this new definition of queer?

&#x200B;

(This is not an applicable concern in all spaces. Planned Parenthood, for example, uses this definition: ""Queer is a word that describes sexual and gender identities other than straight and [cisgender](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/all-about-sex-gender-and-gender-identity/what-do-transgender-and-cisgender-mean). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and [transgender](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/teens/all-about-sex-gender-and-gender-identity/what-do-transgender-and-cisgender-mean) people may all identify with the word queer. Queer is sometimes used to express that sexuality and gender can be complicated, change over time, and might not fit neatly into either/or identities, like male or female, gay or straight. "" I am not interested in examples of cis men being included in queer spaces, but the growing number of spaces that are deliberately excluding them WHILE including trans people.)

Edit: if you are a cis woman coming into this post to explain that you know better than I do (or any other trans male commenter) about why trans men need to be included in women’s spaces, a) this is not the post for you and b) maybe think about why you think you have both the need and the right to tell trans men what they need and speak over us in our own spaces.",True,820,0.97,259,,/r/MensLib/comments/hummd4/masculinity_and_queerness/,grayperegrine

2020-07-20 22:37:22,Audioslave’s Doesn't Remind Me music video is a story of toxic masculinity.,"The video: https://youtu.be/lBFdX37Qpnk

I don’t know what Audioslave and the video's director intended. They may have meant for the boxing match to be liberating, or may have meant to make it disturbing. But ignoring the artists' intentions it's a disturbing story of a cycle of toxic masculinity. The family has lost their husband and father to war, and the very-young son finds solace in… playing with toys that look like weapons of war, running away and breaking things, and getting involved in a violent competition*. The son is too young to know any better but it seems society (including his mother, but also everyone training him and cheering him on) is more than happy to repeat the toxic cycle of violence that got his father killed. The son seems to feel better after winning the fight, his mother feels proud, and his trainers are glad he's learning and enjoying the sport, but it's a great microcosm of ""everyone in this situation is just doing the best they can but this is how we end up unintentionally normalizing violence.""

I think it works well with the lyrics too. One possible reading of the song’s lyrics is the singer is trying very hard to remain in denial about something that is troubling him. Similarly, instead of dealing with the trauma of losing his father, the son in the video is seeking out distractions - and this case those distractions are mostly violent.

Plenty of people will complain when a woman is needlessly sexualized, but there isn't much talk of the same happening to men. Plenty of movies and tv shows have men randomly shirtless like Riverdale, Pretty Little Liars, and even marvel movies do it. In the context of Marvel movies, the men being shirtless rarely has anything to do with the plot. That's why I don't buy Thor randomly shirtless is a ""Male Power Fantasy"".The thing that annoys me the most is that the same women that complain about oversexualized women will eat up the oversexualized men. Shouldn't we raise the standard of female characters, not lower the men?

I think media that caters to women aren't any better at portraying the opposite gender than media for men. Take Pretty Little Liars. The male characters don't have any agency and if they aren't conventionally attractive and walking around shirtless, they are usually villains.

2020-07-20 03:37:53,Am I correct in assuming that male rape victims are misunderstood due to ignorance and not misandry?,"Hi everyone, feminist and mens liberationist here. I feel that a big reason people dont understand male rape victims is because of misinformation.

See, the thing is firstly, some male rape victims get an erection or even ejaculation during the crime. While it's possible to get an erection due to pleasure it's not always the case (hence why some guys wake up with 'morning wood') so because of that it becomes difficult for some people to acknowledge he was raped because they think he 'enjoyed it.' Ironically I've also heard the same excuse given to female rape victims because some of them might climax

Another thing, some people don't understand how exactly a man can be raped. Many people have a wrong view of sex, that it is just a 'penis into vagina' thing, and they don't consider lesbian sex to be 'real sex' and they also believe that when it comes to sex men are the 'active' ones and women are the 'passive' ones. I didn't think men could get raped when I was younger, but I gave myself an education and even explained this to other people (like my mother and my friends)

Another thing, alot of people believe that male criminals 'deserve' to be raped. In some countries e.g USA they have a culture where alot of people have an active disregard for the treatment of incarcerated people, that if you did something wrong you deserve  a punishment far worse then what you did. That's why a lot of people don't take police brutality seriously, because they put the blame on the other person. So male rape victims of the prison are disregarded

I propose a solution:

We start trying to educate people on rape, even more then we did before. I haven't seen many videos or presentations where they explicitly state that someone might climax during rape. They should make it clear it's still rape, regardless of gender, regardless of clothing.

So I figured it might be an idea to share in our collective wisdom, some of the realisations we’ve had about ourselves, our past behaviours, the way we’ve improved them, and just share them together as a community; just in case someone happens to be a few steps behind us on the path we’ve been walking and could do with a helping hand!

I felt the world around me, felt all the anger, the shouting, the demands of all those crying out for attention, and I came to peace with the fact that none of these problems will find their ends neatly tied up any time soon, and that’s ok. I think so often we demand a huge overarching solution to the problem, that we miss the thousand small things that can be done every day.

I don't have anything against positive male role models, it's just that women have to cross so many obstacles and so much ridicule to be recognized for their work and I think that boys can learn really important lessons from their lives. There's also the fact that so many male role models are letdowns once you learn how they have treated women and/or other oppressed people.

I'm glad some of you have had better experiences than us with actual feminists and that so many of you have supportive people or are supportive people! I may not respond but I read every response I get!

EDIT 2; Okay just to clarify

\-Yes, I am referring to TERFs and people with similar man-hating ideologies when I say ""so called feminists"" with heavy quotes. I am a feminist myself and would not bash on actual, real feminists doing actual, real, good work for people of all genders. I'm sorry I didn't make that clear enough, I just really hate those people that give actual, real feminists a bad name.

\-Yes I am NB. Yes my honey is straight. He is still straight despite that I am NB. I am NB despite that he is straight. :P 

Hello! I (23AFAB NB) wanted to share on this subreddit because I'm proud of my honey's (22M) achievement and because he gave me permission to post this. He's a feminist and as well as caring about women's suffering, he also cares deeply about the suffering of men (as do I) and thought this subreddit was awesome when I told him about it.

To paint a picture, my honey looks like he'd be a very privileged citizen. Looks white, (actually mixed but not the point here) natural blond hair, good looks, committed relationship, cis man, and straighter than a pole. Other so-called feminists laugh at the thought that someone like him could possibly be hurt by a system like our's. Well, guess what?

He was a victim of rape when he was a child. I learned this a long time ago when we were just friends nearly 10 years ago (Yeah, we were high school sweethearts :D) and I always believed him and was supportive of him being open to me about what happened. The people who did this are all now dead or in jail, so justice has been served, if anyone is wondering. Still, it plagues him to this day (naturally) and I've long encouraged him to see a therapist because even if *I* believe him, I'm not a trained psychologist so there's only so much I can do

On top of this, my honey has terrible self-image issues. He's long had lots of girls and even guys throwing themselves at him, but due to being bullied for being overweight as a child (he's actually quite  muscular, but due to surgeries he's had as a child because of a near-fatal car accident, you almost can't tell until you see him lifting heavy boxes and other shows of strength) he always says he looks like the Stay Puff Marshmallow Man, which hurts me because I hate to see him self-loathing so much. We are also cosplayers  and he's been ridiculed before for wanting to cosplay Batman (He's heard ""lol more like ""fatman"" hur hur hur"" so many times and it makes me wanna kick a bitch) and talks about wanting to be ripped like Jason Momoa or any other superhero actor, despite knowing (probably in part of my nagging for so many years) that they have to literally dehydrate and starve themselves to look like that and still need Hollywood effects.

That is... until now.

My honey opened up to me yesterday and told me for the last 5 months, he's been hiding that he was Bulimic, but he decided a 2 weeks ago to take the plunge and go see a therapist. Said therapist has been really helpful to him and has been giving him some healthier coping mechanisms and solid advice. He told me one of the things his therapist said was that he needed to open up to me, so he did.

Men are silenced far too often and it makes me so angry when so-called ""feminists"" want to exclude men from their ideals of feminism. Patriarchy hurts everyone, and I tell everyone this! Male rape victims need to be heard, and yes, women are sexualized to hell in the media--but men are *idealized* the same way, and it's just as harmful in the same ways, but the only difference is if a man mentions this, he gets laughed at or ""feminists"" jumping down his throat telling him he's a got a penis, the fuck does he have to worry about?!

Rants aside, I wanted to share this because I'm proud of my fiance. I'm proud of him for coming out about dealing with an eating disorder and for his decision to seek help. I was upset he didn't do it before, but I understand why, and I'm glad he did before something so much worse could've come out of it. I've read so many stories about men seeming so happy, only to suddenly up and kill themselves because they didn't open up about the pain they're suffering. He's one of the most important people in my life and we're planning to get married when COVID is over. If something were to happen, I don't even want to begin to imagine what I'd do without him.

2020-07-17 21:58:00,What’s your experience of “mens work?”,"We talk a lot about “women’s work” as a society and I know that in my house we’ve largely tried to eliminate it.  I play a big role in child care, I cook most days, I clean etc etc.  I remember all the birthdays and do all the financial stuff.  I don’t mind this kind kind of work, because it’s typically the kind of thing which is repetitive but usually sociable and you can chat while you do it.  My wife and I are typically a good team when doing this kind of thing and we’re often both busy in the kitchen etc, listening to music etc, it’s nice.

However, over the last 20 years I’ve come to really hate and resent work which has been traditionally regarded as “men’s work”.  Just in the last year I’ve had to:

Clear gutters. 
Paint our old wooden windows. 
I had to knock a hole through our concrete patio to clear a blocked drain, literally covering myself in shit.  (The drain turned out to be blocked with sanitary towels). 
Point a wall.
Climb on to our roof to clear an old loose arial.
Fix cracks in our walls and decorate.
Haul junk to the dump.

Now..  it’s not like I enjoy this stuff.  It’s actually quite stressful and these jobs tend to pile on me psychologically making me feel like our house is getting dilapidated.  Usually you end up having to watch a YouTube vid teaching you how etc and invariably they’re done entirely alone in the pissing rain or whatever.

My wife gives very strong hints that she also wants these things done but she basically makes it clear that she wants no involvement apart from the most basic kind.  Her usual thing is that she says “Can’t we get a man in?” Which often I look into, realise we can’t afford it (the prices these guys charge!) and so end up being forced to do it myself.  It provides deniability though of course because I *chose* not to pay someone.  The other idea she provides is that my Dad somehow thought me to do all this stuff and she never learned.  The problem is that isn’t true!  The very first DIY I was ever involved in was when we bought our first house and it was clear that stuff had to be done.  I rapidly learned to dislike it, although I’m aware some men seem to enjoy it.

So what gives with “men’s work?”.  It’s something I’d love to abolish but it doesn’t sound like it’s happening any time soon.  Is my experience the norm or are you all doing better with this than I am?

2020-07-17 07:27:08,Is anyone else a bit frustrated by all the...reaction to the Henry Cavill PC build video?,"Men, I need to vent about this a bit and need to bounce this idea off y'all. 

So if you're not aware, the actor Henry Cavill has a video out where he builds a PC. Normally, this is great! Mainstreaming things that used to be shamed hobbies is fantastic and wonderful for positive masculinity.

However, I'm sorta disappointed in our women allies today. Women I respect have been reacting to it in a very unhelpful way that reinforces a lot of negative messaging to men.

Mainly, thirsty and horny reaction. 

I'm struck by the message being sent by this: ""This activity that you've participated for years, all of the sudden is *amazing* when a hot guy with an unrealistically ripped body does it"".

It sends the message to men that, you know, attractiveness is everything. Reinforces stereotypes about body image and expectations of such in men. That our hobbies are boring unless we're hot, then it's *so cool.*

Am I wrong in thinking this reaction is problematic? I understand that power structures and such change how we're sorta allowed to communicate, but I can't help feeling like if the gender was changed here this would be a completely different conversation. I know the ""if genders were flipped"" thing is a trope used by toxic men often, but I can't help but see it in this situation. Edit: (it's not just even mild-type comments, one person said something like ""doesn't he know clothes can cause static buildup?"" yikes!!!)

What's kinda sad is I've seen this reaction put forth by women I'd consider to be feminist voices. And it's more than a few voices. While I can't expect them to be perfect, I'm a bit disappointed.

Also, I'm afraid to reply to any of these people because I'm not sure if I'm right here. I feel like calling this out is the right thing to do but I don't know if that is actually the right thing to do.

2020-07-16 19:07:01,Discussion: should we be using the term 'Toxic Masculinity'?,"I was listening to a very interesting podcast called [Let's talk bruh](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/lets-talk-bruh/e/64627913?autoplay=true) in which the host interviews Tony Porter, the founder of the organisation [A Call to Men](https://www.acalltomen.org) and the famous, identically named [Ted-talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=td1PbsV6B80&t=1s). 

Porter and the host discuss the term Toxic-Masculinity \[from 17:50 onwards\] and why Porter prefers not to use it in his work. He says that although he praises and appreciates the term for the conversation it has sparked about masculinity, he also notices that:

>\[20:32\] when we use terms like ""toxic masculinity"", there's a couple of thing that come up for me. One is, we are now putting masculinity on a scale. So there's toxic masculinity, sort of toxic masculinity \[...\], there's average masculinity, sort of exceptional masculinity and exceptional masculinity– I don't want to create that \[...\]. The other thing that comes up for me that's even more important is that, for example, men who are ""toxic"" right? They don't get to be that way on their own. Now, we know that's the minority of men in comparison to the majority– I think we would all agree with that. But the questions then is ""if we have this minority of men that is toxic, how did that group of men, that minority of men, get to be who they are in the presence of all of us men who are not toxic?"" How does that happen? What roles do we play in it? What responsibility do we have as men, if we far outnumber them? And if we don't believe that violence against women and girls –'cause that's what we usually talk about when we talk about toxic masculinity– and we believe that violence against women and girls is bad. And that we as men who are not toxic would never do that: than how does it happen in our presence? How does it happen on our watch? Why is there no collective outrage amongst us?  
>  
>\[23:10\] we as men, who don't perpetrate violence against women and girls; the culture of manhood that we're responsible for, has created the fertile ground for these \[toxic\] men to exist in our presence. So I'm real cautious about putting them over here and putting us over here. 'Cause when we put ourselves over here, we're saying ""that's about them, it ain't about us"". And then it lends towards operating like we don't even have work to do, 'cause we're solid! That's them!

This is slightly edited for clarity, so I really encourage you to listen to the entire podcast episode or at least the discussion of this question in its entirety.

I was curious to hear what you think about these observations. I think I agree with Porter, that using the term toxic masculinity runs the risk of qualifying things as toxic or non-toxic, which ignores how ""non-toxic"" behaviour can still allow toxic behaviour to manifest itself freely. It also digresses from the conversation about masculinity itself, where we must question and criticize ideas and notions about masculinity which cause harm to women as well as to ourselves. Signifying behaviour and things as toxic is not questioning such things, but labelling them as bad and undesirable. It can lead to cognitive dissonance towards other behaviour that is not inherently bad also isn't helpful either, and encourages a cancel-culture that circumvents a heartfelt and necessary discussion on how to be a man in the 21st century.

2020-07-15 22:10:34,Anyone else disturbed by the reactions to that kid who was attacked by a dog?,"There's a news story on r/all about this 6 year-old boy who was disfigured by a dog to save his sister. A bittersweet story, because the injury is nasty but the attack could have ended much horribly. And with regards to the attack, the boy said that he was willing to die to save his sister - a heroic saying, but hardly clear whether a 6 year-old fully understands what he's saying.

What's bothering me is the comments on that story. Calling the boy a hero, and a ""man"". There's a highly upvoted post that literally says ""that's not a boy, that's a man"". 

Isn't this reinforcing the idea that what it takes to be a man is to be ready to give your life to someone else? Am I wrong to think that there's something really wrong in seeing a ""man"" in a child, due to the fact that he was willing to give his life for his sister?

He's not a man. He's a kid. A little boy. His heroic behaviour doesn't change that. His would-be sacrifice does not ""mature"" him. He needs therapy and a return to normalcy, not a pat in the back and praise for thinking his life is expendable.

Just to be clear, my problem is not with the boy or what he did, but with how people seem to be reacting to it.

Social norms and the fear of standing out cause plenty of boys growing up to supress their interests in the goal of simply fitting in. So everyone kind of abides to these rules that are inscribed in our mind by everything we see and hear either on tv/in movies like the classic trope where eating vege/vegan is “gay” or “feminin”for example amongst others. On top of that school reinforces this mentality and supresses you even more. Just like beauty standards are a big issue with girls of all ages behavioral standards seem to be imposed onto boys. 

Tldr. Social norms are there to control us in and out of the media. They basically are reinforced by echo-chambers in schools and the drive to fit in, regardless of gender.

And there are many substantial obstacles to good mental health these days. But another thing we don’t do is celebrate when men have something good happen in their life and we especially turn a blind eye when men express their pain and look for support. A man turning to others for help instead of silently suffering alone is a cause for celebration. We’re a brotherhood and a family and we need to better reward each other for nurturing their self esteem and coming here to celebrate success and we need to celebrate when they successfully come to us for support.

Edit: 
There’s apparently disagreement and confusion.
This post isn’t about my life. This post isn’t about society in general, though we could apply it there too. This post is about this community, on this platform, and others like it. This community stands for the recognization of men as people with the full range of the human experience, and as such, we should not forget that pain hits harder than joy but is no more or less important to recognize. The ideal that r/menslib aspires to help create is one where all people no matter what gender are empowered as happy, healthy, and generous people who recognize their role to their neighbors in maintaining that mental and societal health. 

Therefore, to those who have held back because we’ve focused more on offering support (which is desperately needed in its own right), post more comment more.

2020-07-13 00:41:44,I wish leftists considered it unacceptable to body-shame men.,"Edit 2: Thanks for the Gold and Silver. I'm not exactly sure what they are... but I'm grateful nonetheless!

Edit: *Clarification for why I'm identifying 'leftists' here at the bottom.*

I don't know if this is the correct place to post this. But the issue I am posting about pertains specifically to leftism and men, and I'm not sure where else a post like this would go. I hope posting this here is okay.

Recently, Blake Neff, a writer for Fox News host Tucker Carlson was outed as an online troll posting racist and misogynistic content under a pseudonym. You can read about the story [here](https://edition.cnn.com/2020/07/10/media/tucker-carlson-writer-blake-neff/index.html) if you wish.

If you are familiar with this story and exist in left spaces online, you are probably already aware of how leftists have chosen to talk about this story. If you aren't, then [this](https://twitter.com/morninggloria/status/1282042270493970432) tweet and the replies/quote retweets are pretty representative.

By and large, body-shaming is now how leftists respond to bigots who happen to be physically unattractive. I understand why these tactics have been adopted. People are tired of 'debating' racists, sexists, fascists etc. But when the bigot in question is a woman, everyone understands why it is wrong to body-shame even a bigot (the argument being that, on the whole, it hurts good people far more that it hurts the bigot). This conviction is completely abandoned however when the bigot in question is male.

Over and over again I will see leftists describe bigoted men as genetic failures, incels, disgusting creatures who no woman would ever want to touch, **not** on the basis of their bigotry, but on the basis of their recessed chin, or their premature baldness, or whatever else might make the man unattractive. I unfortunately share the physical appearance of these men. It has taken a toll on my mental health to constantly read these comments, *specifically because they come from the 'good' people.*

For a while now, I have been trying to argue that it is still wrong to body-shame a bigot even when they are male, and I am quite dismayed by sheer ferocity of the opposition I have faced. Even the most empathetic and compassionate members of society simply do not want to let go of their ability to mock men on the basis of their physical appearance. I can only assume that humans have a deeply ingrained desire to be cruel, and unattractive men are like the last *acceptable* target for that cruelty.

I'd like to know what people here think of this. Do you agree that this is actually an issue or no?

Edit: I'm identifying body-shaming *leftists* because it is the left that understands that body-shaming is wrong. So it's a double standard when they turn around and body-shame one specific type of person.

For my final project, I am interested in writing about what trauma-informed spaces for men/folks that identify with masculinity can look like. From your experience, how can people in helping professions (mental health, sexual health, substance use/harm reduction services, education fields) be more mindful of and responsive to experiences of trauma? Do ways of supporting femme trauma survivors translate to men’s spaces? What do you think is most important when providing services to men that are working through experiences of trauma?

2020-07-12 07:27:51,Do men get enough compliments?,"I am skeptical that this is an actual problem, but it has been taking the internet by storm lately (read: it's a meme among teenagers on twitter and tiktok), so I thought it would be worth bringing up here.  The meme usually involves a [guy acting unusually grateful](https://vm.tiktok.com/JLSv98W/) for a mundane compliment, or wistfully recalling a minor compliment he got years ago.  It is usually hyperbolic and meant to be funny, but also reflects what the guy posting it sees as a truth: that men are starved for minor forms of positive validation.  I did some digging, and found that people had been talking about this for a while, such as in [this old reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1evwm1/do_most_men_really_not_get_complimented_very_often/) and in [this Atlantic article](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/why-men-cant-take-compliments/282164/).

Do we think there's something to this?  I'm not sure.  I agree with the normal feminist claim that men are more likely to be recognized than women for various skill related accomplishments - but maybe that's different from more minor forms of positive affirmation.  Or, maybe a ""compliment deficit"" only exists in the realm of physical appearance, and is less a bad thing for men than it is a reflection of the weight gender norms place on women's appearances.  Or, maybe men are less likely to give compliments than women, and since same gender friendships are more common than cross gender ones, women get more compliments as a result.  Or, maybe there really is a deficit, fueled by gender roles suggesting men don't need positive affirmation.  Or, maybe there isn't a deficit, and some men just have too high expectations because toxic masculinity makes them overconfident in themselves.  I do feel like I often crave minor positive affirmation, and find it difficult to remember the last time I got a compliment - but maybe that's just a me thing. Or a human thing, detached from gender.

I honestly have no clue what the answer is but I'm interested to hear people's thoughts.

\----------------------------------------------------

**Follow-up:**

There seems to be a near-universal consensus in these comments that men get fewer casual compliments about their appearance. I was especially struck by the number of trans responders who noticed the difference after transitioning.  Possible explanations (that are specific to compliments about appearance) include:

* Women are understood to place more value on, and experience more social consequences on account of, their appearance
* Men's bodies aren't understood as ""beautiful"" the way women's bodies are
* Women don't want to compliment men about appearance for fear of being perceived as flirting
* Men don't want to compliment men about appearance for fear of being perceived as feminine or gay

There were a lot of responders who felt men receive fewer personal compliments in general too, particularly for positive personality traits.  Possible explanations include:

* Male gender roles emphasize the ""utilitarian"" or ""instrumental"" value of men, to such a degree they crowd out appreciation of men's larger humanity (this seemed to really resonate with a lot of people)
* Men are understood to be less desiring of affection, or less in need of emotional support
* Men display less individuality on average, attracting less positive attention
* Male subcultures tend to value ""ribbing"" and shun compliments

Most responders seem to think men receive more recognition for skills and accomplishments than women, though whether that translates into more compliments seems unclear.",True,737,0.93,277,,/r/MensLib/comments/hpk4nv/do_men_get_enough_compliments/,
2020-07-12 13:54:04,"Do you think everyone would be better off if we stopped categorizing things as ""feminine"" and ""mascline""?","I believe any person of any gender can enjoy just about anything. The concepts of ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" just feel so superficial, prescriptive, and counterproductive. There's no good reason to be this way, in my opinion. 

Sure, I sometimes see people trying to combat toxic masculinity by saying things like ""masculinity isn't about drinking beer or driving trucks; it's about standing up for who you are."" But that doesn't seem right either. It's pointless to gender qualities that *anyone* could have.

It's obvious that *toxic* masculinity is bad, but what about concepts of masculinity and femininity as a whole? Are they necessary to keep around, or do they only exist to put people in boxes and perpetuate stereotypes? 

Some people may argue that femininity and masculinity are good defaults so you already know how to raise your kid depending on their sex, but I disagree. I was raised with Barbies, Hot Wheels, Transformers, Care Bears, ZhuZhu Pets, Soul Calibur II, Mario Cart, Plants VS. Zombies, Razor Scooters, Pikmin, My Little Pony, and Littlest Pet Shops. And I think that's good for balance! You get introduced to a variety of forms of play, and I loved all of them! And Littlest Pet Shops were my favorite! (Okay, I still collect them... I take after my dad; I have a really hard time letting go of my favorite things from my childhood)

I don't think strict gender roles are healthy to impose on your kids. Besides, concepts of masculinity and femininity don't tell you much about how to raise your kids anyway. At least, not the most important aspects of raising them. 

I feel like people should be able to do whatever they want *without* worrying about whether it's ""feminine"" or ""masculine."" Gender-conforming or not, everyone should be able to freely express themselves without the stress of wondering if they act ""like a man"" or ""like a woman."" I think the most important thing is that we act like a respectful and respectable individual. I think we should spread this message to the people around us, and we should especially spread this message to our children.

Of course, these gender stereotypes won't disappear overnight, and maybe they never will, but I guess this is just something I wanted to talk about. I guess it's not so much the stereotypes that I dislike, but the expectations that tend to come with them. If we were to treat ""men are masculine"" and ""women are feminine"" and even ""nonbinary people are androgynous"" with the same weight as ""poodles are pink,"" I think I'd be okay with that. After all, poodles *can* be pink, but we don't expect them to be.

2020-07-11 14:32:44,Reducing sexual desire,"Hello, 
I have a (in my opinion) problematic relationship with pornography and masturbation, wherein I engage in those activities too often, to the detriment of my relationship with women and my own sexual pleasure. I'd like to reduce my libido, or at least get to a place where I am less consumed by problematic sexual fantasies. My hope is that by stopping masturbating and watching pornography entirely, I can ultimately decrease my desire to engage in sexual activities, because right now my sexuality is mostly a source of sorrow in my life. But I'm not actually sure if it works like that (because of course not masturbating will also presumably increase my desire to have sex).

So I was thinking, there must be academic literature on this subject matter. Does anyone know where I can find information about how masturbation and pornography change ones sexual behaviour, and how the cessation of those activities affect libido? And more broadly, any information in dealing with sexual perversion and intrusive sexual fantasies would be appreciated.

I know it sounds like I'm not very sex positive, and that is correct, I'm not, but right now I'm mostly interested in trying to deal with this issue by reducing my sexual desires. If you think my problem is more about not being sex positive, I'm open to literature on the subject, but that's not really my current approach.
Thanks

EDIT: It seems like the consensus here is pretty clear that the problems I have described above are the symptom of other, underlying issues that are not related directly to masturbation or pornography, and could best be addressed by mental health treatment. Seems kind of obvious in hindsight, I guess I've just been trying to avoid dealing with all this.

2020-07-12 03:49:25,How to identify patriarchial habits and behaviours in my communications which are not actually JUST my autism?,"**Pre Script**: This might not be what the title implies. I was unsure the proper way to make the title. I may change the title after writing the summary  


**Context**: I volunteer with a group of people who are all women. I am a non-binary transgender AMAB ( I don't typically mention AMAB in my identity as it is mostly just a thing that's on the outside but my brain/soul is not at all male). I am also autistic. I was recently told that I have some patriarchial behaviours I need to ""unpack"" and unlearn. I was told this by one of the volunteers  who has made anti-autistic and (possibly?) transphobic comments to me...or at least comments about their misgendering me reflecting their behaviour toward me. So it's a little uncomfortable hearing their critique becaue of that but I sitll want to take it seriously and assume they are just right ont he patriarchy part. I am seeking help in addressing any patriarchial behaviours. They listed some of the behaviours but they all were things I was aware of and had attributed to autistm (with the help of some friends who are also autistic and also non-male).  I understand that my trust levels with this person are low because of their past anti-autistic and abelist comments. I also understand that patriarchial everything is somethign the global down to the family level that they try to condition and program into us our whole lives so just about anyone regardless of gender an exhibit patriarchial behaviours.  I also understand that something that is patriarchial can be more obvious because of my autism (like interrupting people more based on their gender) or something which is my autism can be confused for patriarchy (like talking in long stretches and not being good or comfortable with conversational back and forth)

**Question**: How can I reserach the subtle ways patriarchy shows up in peoples behaviour primarly conversation and ways of speeking and also ways of texting and typing? What are subtle patriarchial communication things which aren't explicitly sexist comments that I can unlearn or be on the look out for in myself?

2020-07-10 13:56:18,(TW) Toxic masculinity killed my boyfriend,"my 21M long time boyfriend recently took his own life. this was the kind of suicide that no one ever would’ve seen coming. this kid was the life of the party, a ball of energy when doing something he loves, always talked about his goals/passions, made me feel like a fucking queen. everything was perfect until June 20, 2020. he took his own life in the early morning hours of that day and wrote a note on his phone to me right before he did it. he described a situation he experienced at some point in his life where a friend touched him. he gave no time or age of when this happened. he didn’t name any names either. it was a very vague description but he said things like “i feel so fucked up” “i’m so ashamed” i had no fucking clue. i thought we had told each other all of our secrets but this is something i never had heard of. i feel so much pain for him. i cant imagine the pain he was feeling and god how i wish he would’ve opened up to me or anyone. 

he was scared to open up to his parents bc his dad is a homophobic toxic overly masculine guy. my bf knows i never would’ve judge him or thought of him differently. i don’t think he is weak. i don’t blame this on him. although i was incredibly hurt, i couldn’t be angry with him. we considered each other soulmates. he apparently wanted to propose to me after fall semester. i hope he is safe now and no longer in pain. i just hope he knows that i am not holding anything against him. that i still love him just as much as the last night we had together, when i kissed him goodnight for the last time. 

i am not personally a SA survivor but this stigma against male SA survivors is horrible. i was already a criminology major focusing on sex crimes but this whole tragedy has just increased my passion for just that. specifically with adolescent SA. i think so many men think that because their body reacted a certain way, they automatically are gay or “weak.” it’s a biological reaction it is not your fault.

i just hope that if any male SA survivors read this that they take it as a sign to open up to someone you unconditionally love and trust. there is help out there i promise.",True,2033,0.98,107,,/r/MensLib/comments/hojkrq/tw_toxic_masculinity_killed_my_boyfriend/,gnomegrl

I decided that I wanted to change myself, so I started working out 3 years ago. I follow a strict diet, lift 3 times a week, and sleep enough. And after 3 years' progress and hard work, I have finally reached the thin side of ""normal"". When other lifters see my progress they're surprised at how bad it is. I am doing everything right, but my body is just not made for it. I am having problems accepting that.

My testosterone is very low (5th percentile). My bones are very thin. My tendons tend to injure easily. I have small love handles and a little bit of fat on my stomach. I just look so unmasculine. My wife doesn't care, but I do.

I feel mad that I can do everything ""right"" and I'll never look how I want to. I'll never be a ""strong"" man. I can do twice the effort for half the progress. I look at other men with normal bodies who eat poorly, never workout, and I resent the fact that they could decide to put in some effort and see a transformation like I could never dream of.

I binged a lot of Queer Eye with my wife recently and in a lot of ways it's a perfect show for straight men to check out.

The show centers around a different person each week and a team of 5 gay guys apply their individual expertise to improve that person's life.

It plays out a lot like one of those HGTV remodeling shows, but also goes into their wardrobe, hairstyle, cooking, business advice, and self care.

I grew up in a very Conservative household, but had LGBTQ friends growing up and considered myself kind of woke... I don't think I'm alone in holding no ill-will for people that are different but still having some unconscious latent phobia for them that was programmed in at some point. 

That's the first reason I'd recommend the show. Being a straight guy working mainly blue collar jobs has narrowed my experiences and having some of the latent homophobia I didn't even know was there undone by exposure to the show and cast was like a weight lifted. It feels good to ""know"" and appreciate people that are different from you.

The second and biggest reason I'd recommend the show to straight men is that it delves into topics that straight guys may want to talk about but don't. Hearing successful grown men be supportive, talk about their feelings, talk about self care... these are all kind of foreign to my experience interacting with other men. But it's also totally healthy and cool! It's no secret that male mental health is suffering in part from our idea of what it means to be stoically masculine. The show is a really fun escape into a world where it's not a bad thing to cry if you're sad or openly express your feelings.

Also the tips on display in the show are generally really good. Teaching self sufficiency through cooking, expressing yourself with fashion but staying true to your identity, and doing small things to care for yourself. It's only a television show and probably won't change your life, but it is a chance to have a perspective shift as a straight man.

If you're like me and probably wouldn't have watched the show without someone else putting it on, do yourself a favor and check it out. Just be prepared to cry occasionally. Or a lot if you're like me.

TLDR: Straight guys don't sleep on Queer eye. Emotionally healthy male role models, good advice for straight men that is tailored for straight men, seeing the world from a different perspective is enlightening and makes you feel happy.",True,67,0.82,24,,/r/MensLib/comments/hocs1w/queer_eye_is_kind_of_mandatory_watching_for/,hs_ciba
2020-07-10 07:18:17,Domestic Violence and Toxic Masculinity,"I am currently on a Zoom call around domestic violence in the age of BLM and calls to defund the police.

Tw: domestic and sexual violence

&#x200B;

\*

\*

\*

\*

One thing that keeps occurring to me as an undercurrent is that we need to address the core roots of domestic violence in our culture. (The focus of the call is, understandably, about justice and supporting  survivors of domestic violence and I am not going to derail the call so I will post here.)  I will also lead that I am a trans man survivor of domestic violence, my mother and grandmother survived domestic violence. So did my late husband, his father, and his grandmother. I'm coming from both a professional and personal place in this post. (I was also talking about toxic masculinity with my therapist earlier this week.)

&#x200B;

Domestic and sexual violence are parts of the larger cycle of violence in our culture. No one's first experience of violence is when they hit their wife, rape the drunk girl at the college party, or whip their child with a belt. It starts a long, long time before that. 

&#x200B;

Recognizing that not all people who abuse or perpetuate violence are men, I think a fair amount about how much of our cultural cycle of violence - the cycle creating domestic and sexual violence - comes out of toxic masculinity. Speaking in the US, we have a masculinity that glorifies violence, being physical, fighting, anger, and aggressive competition and denigrates anything nurturing, emotional, cerebral (like using your words), or related to healthy self care as unmasculine at best and feminine at worst. We glorify the idea of men solving their problems with their fists or guns rather than their words.

&#x200B;

If boys grow up in the cultural cycle of violence and imbibe a masculinity that teaches them that the only emotion they are allowed is anger, that denigrates women, that tells them that relying on friends and family makes them weak and unmanly, that medical care and mental health care is only for women, that real men don't apologize, that only real men are completely independent, totally unfeeling, and ready to commit violence with a hair trigger - well, it's not surprising we have a problem with domestic and sexual violence. It's like we're doing it on purpose.

&#x200B;

This doesn't mean the cycle of violence cannot be broken or that everyone in our culture is predestined to commit domestic violence. We're priming people, but it's not a destiny. However, I feel like there would be fewer survivors of rape, domestic violence, sexual assault, and childhood abuse if we developed a culture where is was manly to have a master of rhetoric, it was manly to cherish your friends and family, it was manly to take care of your mind and body, it was manly to own up to what you did even if you knew it was wrong when you did it, it was manly to not need to resort to violence, it was manly to ask for help.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts?

Platonic or not, it doesn't seem to matter, I quickly realized that when women talk about wanting men to be more vulnerable, they generally mean as an aesthetic or a fetish; it's for them to enjoy or consume and it doesn't actually have shit to do with them actually wanting to get to get closer to me. 

As of now, I have specific boundaries that women have to prove to me that they're trustworthy, before they want to get closer to me. Let me clear here, I don't do the same with my male friends, because the problem there is awkwardness, more than anything else. 

My main issue is that I've been called the bad guy for having these boundaries and so many women seem to become absolutely livid at the very suggestion that they have toxic tendencies or that I don't feel comfortable around them specifically.

I feel a weird mix of euphoria, regret, self-doubt, pride for leaving, horror at the REAL injustices of the world and a massive sense of lost time spent hating when I could have been learning.

I've been apologising a lot to friends who had no idea I was such a bigot. It's been especially hard confessing to my female feminists friends as I'm always nervous how they'll react (not that I have many, which played a big part in me slipping down the rabbit hole - I lacked and lack regular contact with friends, especially women.) 

So far I've been comforted and forgiven by everyone I may have indirectly hurt but I wouldn't blame anyone if they turned on me because of my past.

I'm overall happier. I'm sometimes way too excited to learn and have to tone it down a bit (e.g. stopping myself from gushing to black friends about what I've been learning about BLM and Black History - they know, they've grown up with it and live it.)

2020-07-08 07:44:40,"Is it possible for an app like Tinder, Hinge, or even Bumble to be 'Mens Lib'?","Before I begin, hear me out, I promise this is about the way the apps are structured specifically, not about online dating in general.

My main point is that - at the moment - male intimacy (a vital part of an emotionally healthy life, I would argue) is really only acceptable in romantic relationships. Maybe one day this will change, but for now, if a man wants to form a deep emotional and/or physically intimate relationship, he needs to usually find it in a romantic relationship. Dating apps take advantage of this with their algorithms.

Nearly every single modern dating app is running a constant [A/B test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing) on their users. Every time you like/right swipe or dislike/left swipe, you not only change the rating of your profile and the profile you swiped on, but you tell the app what you like in your potential matches by looking at keywords and profile flags (like age, race, education, occupation, etc).

Tinder is a fairly obvious one to call out for its algorithm, as they have admitted to giving their users an [ELO score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) \- though [they vague deny/imply they no longer do so](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18267772/tinder-elo-score-desirability-algorithm-how-works). But make no mistake, they all do this, partly because [Match Group owns nearly all of them, with Bumble being the notable exception](https://s22.q4cdn.com/279430125/files/doc_downloads/2020/05/Match-Group-Business-Overview-May-2020.pdf). All this - the ratings, the monopoly by Match, and (critically) the monetization - leads me to personally conclude that these apps are not really designed to match compatible people up with one another. I would even be so bold to claim that any long-term relationships that come out of these apps are purely accidental - especially for non-paying users. They would rather you keep swiping and matching people who are 'close, but not quite' on some level.

Instead, as for-profit companies, their goal is to keep their users for a long as possible, to maximize their revenue. By knowing who you swipe on, and who swipes on you, apps like Tinder and Hinge can limit the rate of mutually compatible matches any one person receives. They can even potentially limit it across all of Match's services that you may have a profile with- but there is no evidence of this, and is just a possibility. Even Bumble is somewhat guilty of this, but they at least make up for this by flipping the battle of the sexes problem in game theory on its head (tl;dr - by preventing men from messaging first, it intrinsically raises the perceived 'value' of their messages, while also giving women more security in the knowledge that they won't be harassed endlessly).

All this, while it is almost certainly equally applied to all users and genders, I would argue that this impacts men more due to their lack of alternative outlets for male intimacy.

So, what would a feminist/men's lib dating app even look like? The best I have been able to come up with as your old school digital personal ads, and those leave a lot to be desired (or apps like OKC and Tinder never would have caught on).

2020-07-07 15:00:33,How should people react/behave around someone who might have been Red Pilled or joined Alt-right?,"I'm not sure if this is the right community to ask; but I feel like you guys are very wise people and may have some tips for the rest of us. But if it is not, please feel free to delete the post.

How do you respond or behave or react to someone you might think be Red Pilled or have joined Alt-right? Especially when its in real life and offline.

I'm female and also from an ethnic background. Thinking back, I think there were a few people that I knew from real life that might have gone down some really dark path. They would often hide this from me, but they would say certain things or like things slip that would indicate that they might be in those groups.

My first instinct is to leave the situation and end friendships. I think this might be very damaging to Red Pilled people; when I ghosted them.

Whats the best way for people to interact or maintain a safe relationship with them?

&#x200B;

EDIT: thanks guys. I'm sorry I'm not able to reply to all of you, tho I did read your replies. Thats for the validation that I haven't damaged these people further (because that what it feels like when I ghost). I don't mean too. But there are times I've been genuinely scared for my safety.

There are a few things I think are legit concerns I think I should address. I'm also on the neuro-diverse spectrum and I identify as non-binary, so I have a naturally direct way of communication; and I have a fear that I may say something wrong and trigger someone already on a dark path. (ironically, because of this trait, i usually find it easier to make friends with guys more than girls)

This might be confusing, I am Asian, and my ethnic group is both looked as disgusting and ""excellent wifey material"" by the alt-right and by Red Pillers; and depending on the specific ideology. I learned that I have to be extra careful about who I can be friends with now; as I really can't tell who believes in what.

When I say I think someone is showing ""signs""; I can give an example. It happened when someone I met and initially we got on really well. But then eventually there are some very PUA like tactics being used in the interaction like Negging (backhanded compliment), and started making judgements about another ethnic group. I got confused and thought they wanted a friendship, but may have wanted more but I wasn't going to, as I wasn't attracted to him in that way. And it was until the person said they use to go on 4chan and ""participated a little"" that my fear was confirmed...at that point I was kind of scared for my life; I might be doxxed because this is someone who knows my real name and have access to me in real life. And I'm about to reject him. I had to end the friendship and block the person in real life (including disappearing from the larger friendship circle). I'm not sure if people understand the real fear I had for my life at that point.",True,482,0.96,136,,/r/MensLib/comments/hmpnjs/how_should_people_reactbehave_around_someone_who/,TeePeeDucks
2020-07-07 17:03:54,I wish I would stop being asked if I think my female friends are attractive,"It's something that's started to boil over for me recently. Basically I'm a guy, I speak to women or am friends with women, and then I get asked by other guys if I think that they are ""hot"" or if I'm ""into"" them, and I'm really tired of being asked that question.

It's really degrading both to me and them. It reinforces the idea that women are objects that are either attractive or not. It breaks down the progress feminism has made to get women to be seen as people and not as sexual objects. It also reinforces the idea that as a guy, I have a simplistic mind and can only think of a woman as attractive or not, and not as simply a person.

It actually deeply affects me. I've spent years trying to come out of a shell and improve my social skills, make new friends, as well as overcome the mindset that men can't be friends with women. I've had a good amount of success, until someone asks me if I think ""she's attractive"" after speaking to someone

It makes me extremely uncomfortable because for a moment, it feels like a threat to that progress, like I should withdraw back away so that I don't give off the ""wrong idea."" I shouldn't have to clarify to every single dude, every single time that no, I'm not trying to sleep with every woman I speak to. I feel like I have to fight this way of thinking every time I'm asked. Not every conversation between men and women has to be sexual.

Even a close friend constantly asks me this with every interaction I have, and it's really annoying. I almost don't even want to be seen talking to friends by him because I know he's going to ask me this afterwards. I wish I knew how to confront him about this.

But as for the main point, I'm curious why American Masculinity is seemingly more different than many other countries. In ways that aren't good.

In certain places, masculinity doesn't seem to be so rigid. Men can be who they want to be, and they don't have to fit such a narrow mold to be accepted.

But in the United States, it seems like Men have to fit into a narrow mold to be accepted, to an extent greater than many other places. Taken to extremes, it's the mentality of how the only music that ""Real Men"" can listen to is classic rock or country. The only vehicle that ""Real Men"" can drive is a pickup truck. The only thing ""Real Men"" can drink is beer. How ""Real Men"" have to own a gun. Or how ""Real Men"" can't like soccer. Many men in my area of the U.S wear overly manly things like [Beards and Sunglasses](https://i.imgur.com/QyJByK4.jpg), and it seems like it's because they're stuck in a narrow mental mold and afraid to escape it.

It’s not even a real requirement in religions so taking away the right to fuck with your babies privates wouldn’t even infringe on religious rights and they could get it as an adult instead if they wanted to have the procedure so bad.

The only reason they do circumcisions when you’re a baby is because fucking nobody would ever want to do it as an adult. They make the decision for you without your approval, and they do it intentionally that way in some fucked up system of social expectations.

2020-07-02 21:22:23,The Default is No,"I have to give a little preamble so that you know who this is coming from. I don’t call myself a feminist. I love my anarcha-feminists who are some of the coolest people I’ve ever met and make me wish I became a socialist sooner. That said, I roll my eyes at the Slumflowers and Clementine Fords of the world and hate Lena Dunham. I believe social justice spaces often engage in behavior that pushes young men away, I think false accusations should be talked about, I think male issues should be addressed for the sake of addressing male issues.


If any of that turned you off, cool. If any of that resonated with you, then I think I’m the one who can communicate a very important idea.


Recently, a streamer who goes by FedMyster was kicked out of OfflineTV. For those who don’t know what that is, it’s a streamer house, a home where a group of streamers all live together. While there, he engaged in a lot of disgusting behavior, including the sexual harassment of a fellow streamer. [I’ll link her story here](https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sr9tik), but the gist of it is that he would slip into her bedroom, lay on her bed, then touch and kiss her under the pretense that he was too drunk to know what he was doing. Later he would pretend to wake up with no memory of what he did. This is predatory behavior. This is planned. This was probably a precursor to worse, more invasive abuse.


People are describing this as “making a move”.


Not only are his actions being treated as flirting, but the victim is being blamed for not immediately kicking him out, screaming, or saying no. To anyone thinking that way (maybe due to inflammatory internet personalities) I want to share a concept: the default is no. It’s a no until you get an indication that there is a yes. 


Think of it this way:


You’re a 5’3” guy eating a burger at Wendys. The Rock comes along, takes the burger out of your hand and starts eating it on his way out. Did you give him the burger? You didn’t punch him. You didn’t snatch it back. You didn’t even say to the 6’5”, 260 lb former wrestler, “no, don’t do that.” Did you consent, or did you just get robbed for a burger? If the latter, why didn’t you do something, even if it was just asking for help? There’s actually an answer for that.


Along with fight and flight there is a third response to stress: freeze. Like the two others, it comes with it’s own set of physiological responses and is very common. You can’t take someone not saying no as a green light. That’s something you should know when you’re on an actual date or “date” with someone you asked out or were asked out by. Slipping into someone’s room and feeling them up is crossing a line that will trigger a stress response. If you’re someone they trust, someone they didn’t expect this from, they might not know what to do or how to react or how your actions will affect the relationship, or the relationship with others in the house and now their brain is thinking about a hundred things while their body is not reacting.


That is not a yes. That’s a human being reacting to a frightening situation. That’s not making a move, it’s taking advantage of someone.


It’s actually offensive to me how this is being spun as someone just not knowing how to approach women. The line is: “I mean, aren’t you an awkward guy? You know how it is. There’s so much mixed messages out there, am I right?”


This is what led me to write this. I’m an awkward guy with bad people skills. You know how many bedrooms I’ve sneaked into? None. How many women I’ve groped? None. Between my awkwardness and my race, I’ve had to avoid situations where I can even being accused of acting scummy. That shouldn’t be my responsibility. That hasn’t always worked, but it has provided me with the lived experience of awkward men being some of the most considerate people, the least aggressive people, in the world because we have to be. Despite all the talk of incels (which seems to include a lot of married with children men) I’ll die on that hill, on God. 


FedMyster is an outgoing internet personality who knew how to befriend women and then test their boundaries. He’s not introverted, he’s a groomer. I don’t want young men hearing the justification for his actions and making the stereotype about awkward men into a self-fulfilling prophecy just so a predator can get a pass.


If you are a quiet, awkward guy, then people have probably taken advantage of you in the past. You probably think back and wonder why you allowed them to do that. Maybe you shouldn’t have been so nice, maybe you should stop being nice in general. While you should definitely stand up for yourself, don’t beat yourself up. The shame is with the other person, the one who took note of your disposition and took advantage of it. Men who put people in a stressful situation and pretend silence is compliance are the same species. They’re not misunderstood like you, they would take advantage of you in one way or another if they had the chance. They probably have. While sexual harassment should be called out for the sake of calling out sexual harassment, calling out the predators and takers in this world helps you as much as anyone.


Don’t become what you had to fight against so many times. Don’t let anyone confuse silence with a yes. It’s a “no” until you get an indication otherwise. I think you know that, but I know the world can make you question your morals. I know it seems that those without morals are the one getting ahead.

2020-07-03 19:13:16,"The positives of ""traditional"" masculine modes of communication.","Let me start with saying that I don't believe that these things are tied to our biological sex. In my opinion, they're skills and frames of mind that we're socialized into. 

I agree that toxic masculinity stifles us men. We often lack certain emotional skills and that can sometimes hurt us or the people around us. 

The problem is with how we discuss this topic. It's implied that guys don't have any sort of ""homegrown"" skills in this area and whatever skills that we might have are shallow and less important compared to our counterpart. 

This seems to be based on toxic ideas of women having domain of the emotional, therefore they're the natural standard of what should be considered healthy. The obvious problem here is that when you're the standard, you will always assume that the problems will lie in others, by either stifling you or not being like you. We can  see this in how we talk about toxic femininity. Because we almost always frame it in what beliefs that stifle or hinder women to express themselves, as in what hinders them to reach the already good neutral. There's very little talk about what and if they've been taught things that are explicitly damaging because a woman might naturally lack something or been conditioned to be directly harmful. I feel like we talk about toxic masculinity in a much more healthy way, because of this.

To actually express these positive traits is hard. Finding words for them and decoupling them from the traditionalist language they're baked into is very difficult. It might take some time, but I firmly believe that we can create certain concepts and ideas that can benefit everybody. One big issue is that there are a lot of guys and  girls that probably do have a lot of needs, that is hard to be met without learning these more ""masculine"" skills. There's probably a lot of guys that are frustrated with the people in their life that are lacking and feel like he needs to do a lot of emotional labor without getting anything in return. While, at the same time, they don't have the vocabulary to properly explain this. He might also have a hard time setting standards or know what to look for when socializing. Neither can he express what he feels about the more toxic aspects coming from women. 

It's hard for me to actually concisely explain WHAT these masculine skills are. The best thing that I could think of is that they're more cooperative in nature. Meaning that they're based upon the ability to create a shared emotional space, with it's own agreed upon emotional dialect that guides how all parties express themselves. I think the biggest thing with this space is that very little is assumed but actively and collectively built and agreed upon.

I [18F] lurk on this sub and really appreciate the conversations that are had here. I am a feminist but I sometimes struggle to approach the appreciation of my opposite gender. 

On social media, I often see artwork and pages that represent the beauty and power of a woman in an archetypical (etc) sense. I don't really know how to link images but a good example is those paintings you see of a pregnant woman, surrounded by stars and galaxies, and a long post about the magic of birth and all that.

I don't even know where to begin to find styles of art like this that appreciate manhood, and I wouldn't want to be out of touch if I did.

2020-07-01 01:13:10,"Men should not be shamed for liking feminine activities and going through ""feminine"" methods to look attractive.","I like to monologue to myself all the time about random things, and I recently started a conversation about how silly I think it is that men are shamed by other men for partaking in feminine activities or furnishing their appearances with methods associated with femininity.

I would consider myself very metrosexual, and I feel best this way because I, as a trans man, have seen life from both sides. Activities that I used to fear as a woman are now simply part of my life as a man, and overall, I feel like I can embrace my feminine side more. For me, a part of that is dressing well and grooming myself. Every day, I wear nice clothes, like to do my hair, and take care of my skin, and I do my best to take care of my body by exercising regularly. I also decided to treat myself throughout the week and get all my three months of COVID length professionally cut, get a manicure and pedicure, a massage, and now I am scheduled for a Brazilian wax in a couple weeks. The big question is, did I feel like less of a man after doing all this? The answer? Of course not! I feel like *more* of a man because I'm in tune with my needs and what makes me happy. I choose not to go into the fancy, colourful stuff because that's not my game, but no man should be afraid to get colour on his nails or put makeup on his face. I just like to look clean and functional.

I really like it when women take in my looks, I also get complimented all the time on how clean I look. It feels much better to me when I've earned a woman's gaze and that she's chosen me. I'm not super social, but it does help me socially in both ways, I have a few male friends and a few female friends, and they all think that my balance of masculinity and femininity is something inspiring.

It's a conversation that not a lot of people have independent of the LGBT community or when making parallels to gender stereotypes faced by women (this is my wordy way of saying ""it's never just 'brought up'""), and while there's certainly nothing wrong with being part of it (I should know), I just feel like it should be a conversation straight men should comfortably be a part of too. 

As a society, we demonize femininity and see it as a death sentence to a person's manhood; this manifests in more than just beauty as this community is well aware. The demonization of femininity is the reason why men feel they cannot share their emotions, cannot admit to being hurt, cannot strive to feel beautiful, and praise aggressive behaviour. It's also where homophobia stems from; lesbians are seen as okay because they're stereotyped as masculine women (and because the conventionally attractive ones are objectified), but gays are seen as gross because they're stereotyped as feminine. It's also a thing in the trans community; us trans men are not taken seriously because most of us look like young Justin Biebers (feminine men) when we first start transitioning, and trans women are treated like the plague partly because they're seen as feminine men instead of the women that they are, although there are many more reasons why they're treated so poorly. There are also people out there who would accuse me of having regrets because I've adopted some feminine habits, but ironically, that's the complete opposite of regret, it's a form of acceptance for who I am. 

I'd really like to see what you all would say and if you have any experiences or thoughts on male beauty you'd like to share.",True,2178,0.97,248,,/r/MensLib/comments/hirjpe/men_should_not_be_shamed_for_liking_feminine/,I-Am-the-Cold
2020-07-01 03:08:51,Sexual harassment of adult men by teenage girls,"A thing that happens and I think we don't talk , guide, and educate about enough.

This is coming from a very personal place for me. I used to work in the non-formal education field, specifically summer camps, and I used to be the subject of many ""counselor-crushes"" which eventually led to me leaving the field (along with a general sense of having grows out of it). You all know what I'm talking about: a group of girl-campers would decide that they have a crush on the counselor, and would go on to make suggestive comments, trap him alone in the room with them, even touch him inappropriately. Most times this isn't a single girl, but a group of them who make their counselor crush the thing that bonds them (a common interest they share) throughout the summer camp. The place I worked used to handle cases of boy-campers touching female-counselors inappropriately very well: they'd take him aside, and explain the idea of personal space to them, keeping in mind that our country has an extremely lacking sex-ed program and that there's a good chance they simply don't know what they are doing.

However, when I'd request a conversation like this be done with my female campers I would often get dismissed. ""It's harmless fun""; ""They aren't a threat to you""; and my favorite: ""You should be happy, they are bonding over you!"". This is a very risky situation for a man to be in, since if you aren't familiar with this dynamic, it's very easy to look at teenage girls harassing a male adult and interpret it as him harnessing them. I was 18 at the time, and my place of work had a lot of ""how to prevent sexual harassment"" sessions during orientation, but it was always in the vein of ""how not to rape""/""how to stop the campers from raping each other"". And yeah, sure, there are things that you as the adult in the situation can do to protect yourself, never be with a camper alone, never close the door when there are no other adults around, (don't actually exploit them obviously) - and while those are good tips to share, I don't understand why we are so averse to having the same type of ""disturbing personal spaces of people isn't OK"" conversation we won't hesitate having with a boy, with girls. Sometimes the person who seems like they have all the power, is actually extremely powerless, and even if they are the ones who have the potential to cause a lot of damage and harm (being an adult in a position of power and all), I think that they also have the right to feel comfortable.",True,382,0.96,57,,/r/MensLib/comments/hitxdr/sexual_harassment_of_adult_men_by_teenage_girls/,mizel103

A study from the University of Cambridge suggests that children's emotional self-control is improved by early positive interactions with their fathers. It suggests that dads engage in more physical play with children than mothers and children with this type of fathering seem to develop better emotional control. Children who had 'high quality playtime' with dads were less likely to express behavioural problems. The article notes there are limitations to this research but Dr Ciara Laverty of the LEGO Foundations notes that we need a shift in policy to structure time and space to engage with children for both parents.",True,640,0.99,23,,/r/MensLib/comments/hikl69/study_suggests_that_playtime_with_dad_may_improve/,NightOwlsFire
2020-06-30 16:49:52,Pop culture men not conforming to stereotypes,"I was researching some old Prince songs for a project, and came across [I Wanna Be Your Lover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp8WL621uGM) which was his first hit, over 40 years ago.

I was struck by how incredibly androgynous, even feminised he is. I've watched Prince for years and obviously knew this (although he changed his look a lot at various points so I'd forgotten how extreme it could be), but I've never thought about how odd this is given the supposed pressures on men to conform to certain macho stereotypes.

It's not just Prince - David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, I'm sure there are tonnes of others. These were incredibly popular, successful artists with (as far as I know) just as much following among men as women. They were as validated as people as it's possible to be (can't imagine there's a much bigger kick than having literally 10s of 1000s of people screaming for you in a stadium). And this was 40-50 years ago.

Now I know Mercury struggled with homophobia, but this isn't really about sexuality as much as men feeling entirely free and even encouraged to deviate, hugely, from traditional masculine stereotypes.

I totally accept the pressures on men, and agree with many of the threads on here. But I wonder what explains this anomaly. Of course these are not regular guys, and anyone dressing like this in the majority of day to day scenarios in the 70s would doubtless have been mocked mercilessly, or worse.

What are your thoughts when an ally badly fails?

Edit:  

[Harris O'Malley, or Dr Nerdlove, has been outed as guilty of sexual harassment and assault.](https://www.resetera.com/threads/progressive-and-nerd-dating-advice-columnist-dr-nerdlove-harris-omalley-admits-to-sexual-harassment.237589/)

He issued a statement about it shortly before taking a week off for July 4th.

[And  the first column the week after is by a woman apologist who writes  about forgiveness but never directly comments of O'Malley or his issues](https://www.doctornerdlove.com/guest-post-flirting-and-forgiveness/).

So,  a supposed feminist and ally of women actually has a history of sexual  harassment and sexual assault. This should surprise no one.

And  a woman steps forward to tacitly defend him. This is disappointing,  even if it is also not surprising. Because there is always someone  willing to defend most anyone and anything on the internet, no matter  how vile the subject.

O'Malley is a  fraud, but then so are almost all advice columns. He is also,  apparently, a sexual predator, as are too many men who call themselves  feminists. O'Malley has enough strategic sense to try and time these  things about, but the rest of us should see through that can call him on  his bullshit. This is a case calling for cancel culture. That should  not simply be saved for the proverbial big fish, but for the smaller  offenders as well.

I'm not a man, but I belong to a BIPOC queer group in Europe. Until less than a year ago around 90% of the group were gay man refugees from middle eastern countries and slowly people with other realities arrived to the group (including me). With the new composition we are having some issues because gender has never been discussed until now and is creating distance between us. As you can imagine a lot of things come to play (racism, homophobia, islamophobia, transphobia, assimilation, sexism and so on). 

Honestly, I don't share any of these realities (except for being BIPOC queer and that is way too broad), but this group is a solace to all of us and the division is being very harmful. We are kind of in a lost on how to handle it and in order to have a successful discussion and awareness of gender issues, is important to all of us to understand how they experience their gender as gay man refugees from middle eastern countries. Our goal is to keep the group as a safe space for everyone but that cannot happen without addressing this issue.

Background: I am young, white, female teacher at a small private middle school. I am teaching a summer course about Social Justice to a group of 10 students grades 6th - 9th. One student, who is an incoming 9th grader, has shared his interest in talking about Men's Rights issues. From conversations with his previous teachers, his interest in the topic definitely sounds more like the toxic side of Men's Rights (he had an issue where he was harassing a female classmate and has written papers bashing feminism for school). I'm not sure if he has specific sub interests in the topic like mental health.

I am hoping the Social Justice course can be an inroad to help him start to reframe some of his thinking about men's issues and see feminists as allies rather than antagonists.

2020-06-29 06:18:44,Openly discussed the fact that I’m balding,"So this is the first time posting onthis subreddit after some months of lurking. I didn’t quite understand how or what this page meant, despite looking through lots of interesting and heartfelt posts. Yesterday however, I think I had my own breakthrough.

I’m a 23 year old male who, as most men get to at some point in their life, is (rapidly) balding. Looking at my father, I’ll have thin, semi-weird looking hair in 2 years tops. I want to say this doesn’t bother me, but it really, really does.

Anyway. Yesterday, whilst chilling and having fun with my friends, my good friend and I arranged a bet where the loser would have their hair shaved off by the winner. I won. No problem, right? 
Well the thing is, my friend has outstanding hair with no bald spots of any kind. After taking a little too much off the top, he thought it’d only be natural to do somewhat the same thing to me, as I didn’t fully stick to the rules of our bet. This left me in a situation where I could:

1) Lie and make up some (lame) excuse for him not to do it.
2) Tell the truth.

I chose the latter. It might seem small, but it felt so relieving. I never thought twice about my full head of hair when I was younger, but ever since I noticed my regressing hairline, I’ve been extremely self conscious about it. My friend fully understood my reasoning and commended me for being honest about it. He said he had a similar issue with facial hair as he can’t really grow any.

I’m not sure how easy this is to discuss, but I know for a fact that it’s a hard pill to swallow and even harder to talk about.

2020-06-30 01:34:00,"Let's start a movement: Women Choose January, a month where men can't ask women out.","To break down gender roles, we should have a month each year where men can't ask women out, and women are encouraged to choose whom *they* want to ask out.

This will increase understanding between the genders since women will see what it's like to do the choosing, and men will see what it's like to be hit on by people they didn't necessarily choose. Can men accept, or reject strange women's romantic overtures gracefully? Can women take rejection gracefully? These are all important skills!

Why a whole month? So that there's some skin in the game! If there was just one day when men couldn't ask women out, there'd probably just be fewer dates planned on that day. A month gives women time to build up confidence and learn more about making the choices that usually only men make. A month gives men time to reflect on what it's like to be the more passive participant and practice their subtle flirting (but not asking out!) skills.

Why January? Because it's before Valentine's Day - even more encouragement for women to get out there and choose some men to ask, and for men to subtly flirt as hard as they can. Who knows, maybe you'll meet your Valentine's Day date during Women Choose January!

Proposed Rules - during Women Choose January:

* Men should let women take the lead on all things romantic where stereotypically men take the lead.
* Men can't ask women out.
* Men can't ask for women's phone numbers or other contact details until the woman asks first.
* Men can't message women first on online dating apps. Swiping is fine on apps where all genders normally swipe.
* Men are allowed to *flirt* as much as they want to encourage women to ask *them* out.

Disclaimer: this is aimed at men who date women and women who date men, on the assumption that other queer men and women are already better positioned to buck gendered dating roles, but anyone is welcome to participate.

2020-06-29 06:40:53,What I think it means to be a man,"Today I see a loss of the old virtues of what makes a man fundamentally a man. Soon this definition shall be nothing but folk tale unless we as (future) fathers learn what a man is and HOW to raise men. Perhaps you will recognize some of my talking points if you're an avid reader of philosophy books made by imo the greats (Plato, Nietzsche, Jack donovan, Carl Jung, etc).

 There are four virtues that define a man at its very core,   and were used to define a man for centuries. 

Strength- Not only physical strength to defend your band of brothers or family, but emotional strength to ensure survival in a hunt or be hunted scenario. The strong lead, the strong can get things done. The strong do not let others have control of their emotions, they accept what they can and cannot control in their life, and shed tears only for those that deserve it (Search up stoicism and its philosophy, very impactful in many's lives including my own and I am much happier because of its principles)

Courage- What is strength if one not has the courage to utilize it? A courageous one could lead over the strong if others lack the virtue. Men have to have the courage to change things for the better, for not only themselves but the family.

Mastery- The more one offers to a survival group, the more valuable you are as a man. If you can fight, hunt, build, AND another set of skills, that will set you out of the crowd and earn respect among other men because you are valuable. That is what men do, create value. (Not to say women don't, but it is the man's primary role.

Honor- This sets us aside from animals, we as humans can think and have opinions over others. To honor is to earn something, to know what is right and wrong and is tied to our social navigation of our culture. Honor is a man's reputation for the three previous virtues.

Now, there are things that must be added to the definition of a man past these virtues that we should strive for because of the society that we live in, and I will keep these brief. Intelligence (all 9 types of intelligence are very important and worth striving for), justice, kindness, mindfulness. All necessary to peruse in order to have progress within society and yourself, all tied to the four primal virtues yet go a little deeper. For our morality cannot be removed.

Men must always want to improve themselves, and forever chase the ideal of greek or roman gods, to which we all know will never be obtained, yet inch by inch we get closer to godhood. To have this drive one must have a vision.

Yet a vision must be necessary for any male to want and pursue this. A vision is specific to each person. In order to obtain a vision, one must dive deep into the depths of ones own soul and find their true purpose in this universe, and what they want out of life (No it does not have to be religious, this is something farther beyond that argument and is an important journey for everyone to take).

I hope everyone can take this journey or at least evaluate there position in life and as a man with this post. It is never too early (I'm 19) nor to late to develop into my definition of a man. I'd like to hear your guy's ideas on what it means to be a man in modern society. Thanks for reading.

P.s. I am not qualified as a man to give a true definition of a woman and true femininity as a contrast, but women (or SO since the PC police are roaming about)are meant to be a supplement to our lives, not filling in parts we completely lack. Also some of these qualities apply to just being a good citizen to society. For we are no longer in a small tribe, and striving to be a good citizen is the necessary next step to show our worth to society as men.",True,9,0.73,12,,/r/MensLib/comments/hho34t/what_i_think_it_means_to_be_a_man/,Alameda-Slim

2020-06-27 21:27:13,Men & Vulnerability,"So there's this r/AskReddit post going around about why men don't talk about their problems. I was late to the party, I've lost the comment I wanted to reply to, these thoughts about what I consider a crucially misunderstood issue won't leave my mind in a hurry and I have some stuff to say.

So, this is going to be a rant, it's going to be long, I apologise in advance. Here goes:

It seems to me that a lot of people turn men repressing their feelings into an isolated-success-vs-failure issue, e.g. ""women do/don't like men who cry"", or ""I will/won't receive support from my friends when I open up"" therefore ""opening up is good/bad"", which is totally missing the point. Every single person that has ever existed has been vulnerable at some point in their lives. We all have emotions, and all inevitably feel things we don't want to feel. There's just no way around that.

Now, when someone claims that they appreciate a man who is willing to be vulnerable, it means they appreciate the effort it took to find a better coping mechanism than ""*Warning: emotion undesirable. PUSH-AWAY protocol initiated.*""  In other words, the skills (and the willingness to learn) to manage one's own emotions. You know, the skills everyone and anyone needs to become a reasonably happy and healthy person. Contrary to saddeningly popular belief, ignoring the emotions you don't know what to do with is **not** a solution, and **will** fuck you over later down the line.

That said, the experiences of those who have repeatedly tried and failed to cross this bridge are **absolutely valid**. There are plenty of places and communities that will enforce (sometimes by terrifying means) the status-quo of the stoic, masculine man who isn't fazed by anything. And finding a way to communicate your need for support isn't easy, even to a person who is willing to listen. A lot of men in long-term relationships make the mistake of giving their partner (and often their partner only) the responsibility package of being their therapist, their comfort blanket, and their rock - which is overwhelming to deal with, especially since a lot of men who have been repressing things their entire lives open up in a very explosive, jarring fashion. Other trusted individuals, such as best friends, mentors, even celebrities we look up to are also thrust into these situations. When someone simply doesn't have the skills to even begin sorting through their own pain, it doesn't seem unreasonable ask someone else to do it for them, but the sheer magnitude of the need pushes people away. Which, understandably, feels like a huge betrayal and discourages many from ever doing it again.

(Editing to add: When I say that it's unfair to expect one person to help you with all your emotional needs, I don't mean that you shouldn't open up if you only have one person to open up to. The better option that I'm comparing the scenario to is having a network of people to rely on, which divvies up the responsibility between several helpers, making it much easier for them to manage individually. However, I am well aware that not everyone has a network of people, much less consisting of people that are willing to be there.)

It's very important that we are considerate of our helpers. Those who have been in a high-stakes supportive role will know that it takes a whole lotta patience, empathy and wisdom to be there are the right time, provide space at the right time, say the right things, etc. These situations are volatile, and progress is elusive. Situations where a well-meaning helper ends up the victim of abuse (intentional or unintentional) are not unheard of, and vice versa. The non-damaging versions of both helping and being helped require pretty substantial skill sets of their own. So if you work up the courage to ask someone to help you work through some things, please remember that them agreeing to do so is committing a potentially draining experience. I want to make it crystal clear that I'm not discouraging asking for help, I am encouraging appreciation for the help we receive. After all, if we're going to sacrifice time and effort to help someone, it's going to be someone we care about.

I am aware balancing these things with the people you know irl isn't always an option, in which case we have no choice but to look to external resources that may have the prerequisite of ""manufacturing"" the necessary trust to break down the barriers preventing us from facing our problems ourselves. This adds another layer of hardship and complexity, especially in environments that look down upon seeking avenues such as a therapist or a support group. There is also the very real danger of finding a community that preys on desperate outliers for its own gain.

So what the hell do we do?

The disappointingly realistic answer is: it depends. On who you are, what the people around you are like, what resources are available to you, and, last but not least, what you are willing to do to better yourself. Make no mistake, becoming happier takes a lot of grueling internal work, which is something NO ONE CAN DO FOR YOU. Even with all the help in the world, the crucial healing process is something **you** need to commit to. Otherwise, nothing is going to change. It's the combination of the support you need and the determination to learn and improve that's going to grant results. Often we have one but not the other. So we keep looking. We keep trying. You are probably capable of more than you realise, and there **are** helpers out there - people that understand, that you **can** find common ground with, that **will** listen. I promise you, they exist.

OK, I've run out of steam, so I'm going to wrap this up. The best advice I can give you is this: you matter, and you deserve to be happy. No matter who you are. You may think you have all this proof that you are a horrible person that the world would be better off without, but one of the best things we can ever do for ourselves (and others!) is leave room for growth, and that is a hill I will die on.

2020-06-26 20:37:04,Performing dominance,"A recent event has me digging into my behaviour. And one of the things that's really sticking out is the fact that I feel forced to be dominant. Even when we explicitly set limits and standards, my emotions are all over the place, trying to reconcile with the lifelong conditioning of ""men are dominant and aggressive"". And Im struggling to not listen to that conditioning. 

A big problem is that I have very limited attention. I am starved for romantic and physical connection with others, mostly women. And that I have been left (abandoned) because I wasn't aggressive enough. There are no guarentees in this, so all I can influence is probability; where experience and common advice both paint a future full of pretending to be something I am not.

I am not a dominant person. I can lead within some established guidelines, but even that is following others. I prefer others being themselves, helping those that need it, getting what they need. Be it a coffee, an ear, a laugh, a meal. Thats my default, that I still hide, even after a decade of opening up.

Even, especially, in private, I feel like I will be left if I don't lead. Even just cuddling ""must"" mean that I ""have to"" take it to another level. I hate that I think this way, that I feel this way, even when Im good at pretending at it.

Do you guys have any tips in overcoming this problem? What are your experiences with expectations of expectations of dominance?

Edit:
I worded it poorly. I am not struggling with everyday behaviour. I'm struggling with what I believe are other peoples expectations of my behaviour.
I have no issue actively listening (supposedly very good at it), calling out mistakes, speaking my mind. I struggle with thinking that they WANT me to, on some level (usually only partialy concious) be overbearing, loud, aggressive, dominant.

2020-06-25 23:01:38,Construction culture is incredibly toxic and it’s driving me to a very deep state of depression and constant anxiety/insecurity,"I don’t really know where else to post this but I just have to get it off my chest. 

Im a college student who started an internship for a construction company and it is miserable. The environment is so toxic in all respects. Completely male dominated too, not a single non-male. The people who work with me and whom I work for are all racist, sexist, homophobic and incredibly rude. I really can’t stand it, I work in a constant state of uncomfortably fear and humiliation. I’m constantly scared of one of the workers talking to me, I stay as far away from them as possible. Any conversation, no matter how simple, stresses me out because I have never had a positive interaction working here. 

My first day I hear a white guy say the n word in the context of “never trusting them.” Ive heard the n word about three times since. During breaks they all look at and objectify women on facebook. They gawk and stare at any woman that walks by. They make jokes about others being gay, often times intensely sexual jokes. They constantly fuck with each other by implying another’s stupidity or lack of intelligence. One guy straight up took my tools while I was measuring, twice, and didn’t say anything, just did the measurement for me, as if I was incapable of it. 

I do my job very humbly. I do as little and interact as little as I can. Even with this, im still being treated like im lesser than. I get attitude from others for stuff so simple that it literally takes more effort to give me shit then to just give me whatever paperwork/tools I needed. When people here talk to each other its never positive. Its never reassuring, its never nice, its never considerate. Its just toxic as can be I cannot stand it. I can feel myself getting suffocated by the cement of this masculinity. 

There isn’t an ounce of space to act feminine. Even things that aren’t feminine will get you berated. The way you talk, the way you throw a water bottle away, the way you walk around the site, the way you kight jump a little from being surprised from a machine or sound behind you. This is why im in a constant state of anxiety even outside work I feel like im becoming a horribly suffocated man and I hate this. I become exhausted, the time goes by so slowly at work. I drink sometimes before bed. I cherish the weekends so much. 

I just want this to change. I fantasize about becoming the foreman, hiring a diverse workforce, firing anyone being racist. I just want to be able to work here and not have it make me feel this way",True,3061,0.95,363,,/r/MensLib/comments/hfnl65/construction_culture_is_incredibly_toxic_and_its/,HyruleGerudo

2020-06-26 00:42:51,I (22M) am concerned about who I am and who I may become,"**TLDR; Being on the internet has basically made me project all the bad stuff I read onto myself, breeds negativity, and effects my sense of self. But things aren't so bad in real life for me, but I feel bad regardless. How do I deal with this?**

Hi all,

I am hoping this sub can give me some advice or kind words at the least. A little background on me and then I will get into the issue at hand. I am a 22 year old male who will be starting grad school this fall. I graduated college this spring and will be going back to my alma mater for my grad school dream program. I mention all this so you have an idea of my age, future plans and current life situation - feel free to ask for more information.

So as all young people, I am really worried about who I am now, and who I will turn out to be in the future. This is what I mean by this - I feel like when I read posts on reddit I project them onto myself, even if they don't apply to me at all. I take the stories of bad husbands, close-minded people, bad co-workers, bad bosses, poor friends, weak-people, etc, etc. all so...personally? What I do is I think I am like that or I will become like that - and it really does a number on me.

I feel like a result of this habit has made my insecurities grow, made me hyper-aware of my shortcomings, and made me feel more jaded and sad; overall it really just sucks. Here is some things:

I see posts about coworkers who are bad and share too much and then I think I was like that. The same applies with people who complain about their friends.

I see posts about bad boyfriends/husbands/partners and think ""what if that is me in the future?? What if I end up like that?""

I read posts about people who don't do enough for causes and I feel like I have to burden all the worlds problems if I don't then I am bad.

I read posts about people who don't listen enough to people and think ""what if I am close minded?"" even though I consider myself fairly progressive and I really try to consider issues from different dimensions and perspectives. Then I find myself disagreeing with something/someone and wonder if I am ""progressive enough"" - I can be a tad bit conservative but not that much really. I want to be open minded but not to point where I agree with everything; the flip side is people say I am not forward-thinking enough and such. Then I get jaded and think that they are close-minded because they think anything is okay as long as people agree with them.

I honestly think reddit has a big role in this...should I reconsider deleting reddit or simply just unsubbing from subs that bring this? To be fair those subs don't usually have such content that I do this with - well at least not all the time. So while the internet in general hasn't done much good, I don't want to withdraw and not expose myself to different viewpoints that help me consider things differently.

Additionally, none of this actually transpires in real life - I have always said my piece with respect, dignity, courtesy and in a non-condescending manner. I talk about issues with friends in a moderate manner, and only share what I am comfortable with and what they are comfortable with. But I swear the internet just really fucks me up and I have a hard time accepting myself as in individual in a world where individuality is growing, and people just don't make an effort to acknowledge differences and choose to bond with people despite that.

**How do you deal with finding your place, knowing that people will look down on your values? How do you practice being open-minded but still following and living your values? How do I not project this stories onto myself EVEN THOUGH SO MANY OF THEM DON'T APPLY TO ME? How do you be your best self? How do I be empathetic without walking on eggshells and doubt? How do I know I am doing enough to be better?**

It is a long rant - for that I am sorry and I hope you stuck through it. Please help me - this whole thing has done a number on me really. I don't want to grow up unhappy, dejected, jaded, beaten-down or anything. I really want people to look up to me, I want to be a leader, I want to be there for people, I want to have good friends and a loving wife, and I want to be happy and content. There is a bit more to this but I think this is enough for now - if you'd like to know more I can tell.

2020-06-25 01:54:33,"PSA: Abs should be covered in a layer of fat, actors and bodybuilders dehydrate themselves to create the ""ideal"" physique","I saw this shared on Facebook as a screenshot from Tumblr (which I can't find) so I've typed it out. It is a reaction to people body shaming Jason Momoa for [this photo](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/credit-mega-agency-momoa-1562859381.jpeg).

Transcribed from a Tumblr screengrab:

>Tumblr deleted my long ass rant while I was in the middle of writing it so you're spared and will only get a summed up version:  
>  
>Long story short; your abs are supposed to be covered with a healthy, protective layer of fat. The shape Jason momoa is in during his movies is achieved by a diet designed to lower his body fat to unhealthy numbers, dehydrating him and enhancing his abs with make up. This is what a ripped, muscular, healthy person looks like on their off time. If you think this is a dad bod, for the love of everything that is holy, shut up and absolutely never comment on a man's body ever again. I mean hell, you can still see his damn v-line, what fucking dad bod has that?!  
>  
>Don't believe me? Google some bodybuilders who are off their contest diet. The men who literally make a living for having defined muscles. For 360 days a year, they do not look like the way you think they do. During a bodybuilding contest, these men's body fat is under 7%, they're dehydrated and covered up in fake tan that helps the muscles show up. And it's literally only for that day, because it's extremely unhealthy. Same goes for actors who are known for being ripped - they're at their worst when they're filming. This exact same shit happened with Vin Diesel a few years ago with people getting a paparazzi shot of his ""beer belly"" and I' genuinely worried for the young men who grow up in this society thinking being muscular means having defined abs 24/7.

>Jason Momoa looks ripped a healthy, y'all are just blind with unrealistic standards  
>  
>The beauty standard for men is one that, if achieved and maintained, has a 100% chance of killing them in a matter of weeks or months.

It helped me to hear someone say that with such a strong example, so figured I'd share with the sub.

EDIT: Some folk have correctly pointed out that it's possible to have visible abs and still be healthy which is a fair point.

The other day we watched a movie after dinner and he cuddled up with me, sort of laying so his head was on my chest. I honestly didn't think much of it until I was talking with another friend, mentioned the dinner and the movie, and when he jokingly said it sounded romantic I decided not to mention the cuddling.

So I guess of I have some thoughts and questions, and here they are in a random order. Have any of you guys cuddled platonically (when not drunk)? I'm really bad picking up on signals, so while I don't think my friend is interested in me it is possible. But it's also very possible that I'm overthinking a perfectly innocent interaction that had no ulterior motive based on a passing joke.

The friend is a teammate of mine too, so we hug and do backrubs and partner stretches and whatnot.

1. I suffer from depression and likely wouldn't be alive without therapy 
2. I have started a [low cost counseling service](https://www.talkfreely.uk), am genuinely puzzled by men not using this service and would really like to find out why.  

**My lived Experience**

We don't reach out for mental health help. From running my service, in the last 8 weeks I've had 230 people reach out. Of that maybe 5% were men. Of that, I've had 2 male customers. 

Hell, when I posted on this subreddit a couple of weeks ago, [there was solid discussion and 82 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/gyxgqc/affordable_desi_arab_counselling_service_for/)....**but exactly one person reached out for help.** One would think that in a subreddit like this which self selects for a certain type of man, we'd be predisposed to reaching out for help. 

I've run ads targeted at men and basically nobody clicks. 

Now you could say ""Maybe your service sucks"", but it's not just me.

**Other Sources**

I've talked to therapists in the field who tell me that 80% of their clientele are men. If you look online there are plenty of stats that suggest that men don't get help for mental health

2020-06-24 01:16:32,[TW: Sexual Assault] I was ‘accidentally’ assaulted by a woman and I don’t know how to feel,"Around 6 months ago I was sexually assaulted by a woman. I truly believe there was no malicious intent in what she did, and I continued a sexual relationship with her afterwards, and these points are really affecting the way I’m processing this.

It was our first time hooking up, and I didn’t have any condoms apart from one that had been in my wallet for a while. I refuse to have sex without a condom unless I know it’s safe to do so, and I didn’t know if it was safe in this instance, and I didn’t think the condom in my wallet would be safe to use.

We started fooling around, and agreed we wouldn’t have sex because of the above, but both of our libidos got the better of us and we started having sex and she was on top. Pretty much instantly I realised it was a bad idea and asked her to get off me, and she didn’t respond - I don’t think she heard me. I asked her again and tried to push myself up, and again I don’t think she realised what I was trying to do and she continued. I then had to tell her sharply to stop and forcibly push her off me, which I managed to do, but I still don’t think she was processing what I was saying. 

I then took the condom from my wallet, put it on and we had sex. Afterwards, I told her that what had happened wasn’t okay, and she seemed to have no recollection of me trying to push her off me or asking her to stop. She got very upset and apologetic, and we discussed ways of making sure that it didn’t happen again. We continued a primarily sexual relationship for a few weeks after this until it ended for reasons unrelated to this incident.

I’m a firm believer that a woman is capable of raping a man - but I struggle to define what happened to me as rape. It only lasted 10-15 seconds, I managed to get her off me, I then went back to having sex with her and continued to do so for a number of weeks afterwards. I don’t feel as though I responded in a way that is typical for someone who has been raped. Surely if I was okay to have sex with her there and then, it must not have been that bad, right? It was over super quick and she didn’t do it intentionally, so it was just a silly mistake, right?

I thought I was okay with what happened, I thought I’d processed it as this shitty scary thing that happened to me but I was over it. But last night I was talking to a friend about it (who is/was super supportive) and I felt this rush of emotions hit me, as I was driving home from my friends place i was close to tears and experiencing a mild panic attack. But I also feel that it’s stupid for me to feel that, because what happened to me is nothing compared to the violent sustained intentional assault that I knew rape to be.

I don’t feel animosity to her, I don’t think. I feel scared, like I’m reliving that fear in that moment, and I also feel like a fraud because it’s ‘not a big deal’. I don’t really know how to process this, so if anyone has any help they could give in this regard i would massively appreciate it.

TL;DR I was raped by a woman, but I feel shitty for it affecting me because it ‘wasn’t reeeeally rape’.",True,138,0.96,71,,/r/MensLib/comments/heiooq/tw_sexual_assault_i_was_accidentally_assaulted_by/,SecretAgentFishguts

2020-06-23 03:53:10,"Let's talk about what to do with the police. Reform, defund, or abolish?","As anti-police brutality protests have swept across the world, the question of what to actually do with policing as an institution has been cropping up. Several options have been proposed--reform, defunding, and abolition.

In the most basic layman's terms, the different solutions can be summed up as follows:

**Reform**

This is the route that is most often utilized. Body cams, focus on community policing, bias training, and the like comprise the myriad of policies intended to curb the frequency of police brutality. This often involves increasing the budget of police departments in order to supply these measures, viewing police forces as necessary services and tools for community building and safety.

**Defund**

Instead of increasing the budget, defunding would involve divesting funds that would normally be allocated to the police and reallocating it into programs and services that would improve communities, thus lessening the conditions of crime and, therefore, the need of policing. This includes funding social work, violence prevention programs, public housing, (mental) health care, and better schooling.

**Abolish**

This is by far the most radical proposal. Abolition posits that policing, as an institution, should be done away with mostly or entirely due to its usage as a form of state violence. It often requires defunding or dismantling as a starting point with gradual moves toward policing being an obsolete service. Like with defunding, many of the problems often ""solved"" by police intervention are, under abolition, handled by the respective community instead.

So, what are the pros and cons of these endeavors? Which is the best solution for stopping the prevalence of police violence?",True,32,0.88,36,,/r/MensLib/comments/hdzgxn/lets_talk_about_what_to_do_with_the_police_reform/,BreShark
2020-06-23 03:55:01,Recommendation: Books with stay-at-home dads as protagonists.,"I just got reminded of this series by Kim Stanley Robinson, the Science in the Capital series. [Here's the link to the first novel.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forty_Signs_of_Rain)

One of the protagonists, with a large presence in the series, is a stay-at-home dad that balances taking care of two kids with working remotely as an advisor to a politician.

2020-06-21 21:50:58,A Reflection During International Men's Health Week,"Hey ML fam! Apologies for the delayed post, but if you didn't know, this week was International Men’s Health Week, and I just wanted to take a moment to offer some reflection. Firstly, I’m incredibly heartened to see such a great response to the Tuesday Mental Health Check-In thread. It makes me glad and hopeful to see so many people sharing their feelings and struggles with one another. I also wanted to highlight the importance of destigmatizing mental health. ***Remember, we may not all be mentally ill, but we do have mental health.***  I was thinking about sharing something earlier this week, but energy levels are low these days. As such, I'd like to share a post that I saw on my social media feed that *pretty much* sums up my feelings about the intersections of mental health and masculinity (POST IS UNEDITED):

""To raise awareness for Men’s Health Week, I want to talk about how the stigma attached to mental health helps create the self-perpetuating cycle of toxic cultures of masculinity. This is not to diminish the struggles women and the gender diverse face, but to instead focus on how we can all work to end the dangers posed by cultures of masculinity. These cultures are so pervasive in society and affect everyone, not just men. We can work to fix a great many social ills by ending the stigma attached to mental health. We need to normalise all of these things for men.

Men are raised to hide their emotions. Men are taught to bottle them up, to not let them show and that to do so is a sign of weakness. Men are raised to be aggressive, instead of passive, that dominance is preferable to compassion. The result is a generation of men who have grown up into adults devoid of emotion and lacking in empathy. And it is in these masculine cultures they wind up and unconsciously work to perpetuate the cycle. Sport, the military, the police, the workforce, boys-club-locker-room-talk are all cultures where the mainstream ideals of ‘What makes a man’ are enshrined.

We all suffer from men that have been raised to suppress their emotions, because suppression stops at a point. When the pot boils over, the men that have been raised not understanding how to handle their emotions and to just ‘suck it up’, or ‘don’t be a sissy’ lash out at those in their line of work, their families, friends and partners. Most people are not able to see the factors at play in their life without being taught to think critically. As a result, men grow up thinking this is just they way things are. Men raise their sons the same way they were raised and the wheel turns again.

Grown men are not a lost cause, but in order to solve the problems toxic cultures of masculinity causes, we need to get to the heart and cut out the rot so a new foundation can be laid. It starts with education and early development. Raise boys in households and communities where it’s OK for them to show their emotions. Teach boys that it’s OK to cry, that it’s better to be upset than to hold it in. Normalise boys crying, normalise boys with empathy, normalise insecurities and fears. The cycle must be broken.

The result will be a generation of empathetic men who grow up unafraid to express themselves emotionally. Men who are more compassionate partners, caring fathers and conscientious workers. This has been about men, but EVERYONE needs to work to break this cycle. Women and the gender diverse perpetuate the cycle of masculinity too. Boys and girls need to be raised the same way. End parenting that teaches ‘boys are like this, girls are like that’. Teach boys it’s OK to feel, show and talk about their emotions.

End the stigma against men experiencing mental health issues.""

Again, I don't agree with everything that is said here, but it captures my feelings pretty well. One of my biggest life mottos is ""**Be the person you needed when you were younger.**"" Also, **""We're all human. Everyone goes through ups and downs. It's OK to not be OK. Be kind to yourself.""** (You may have noticed that I've said this a few times in the check-in thread, haha.) I always say that life is a learning process. We are responsible for learning positive, wholesome behaviors, whilst unlearning negative, toxic ones. The cycle can break and end with us. Lastly, I'd like to give a shoutout to my fellow mods for the tireless work that they do managing this sub. They really are a bunch of rockstars!

2020-06-21 16:30:52,I'm confused about male role models,"Hi everyone, first of all I love this community and I don't know where I'm going with this but I felt like I needed to adress this.

I don't know how can we expect future youth to behave and grow into better men than we are right now when there is so much silence around public figures doing horrible things.  
Last week I learned about Chris D'Elia's predatory behavior and I was so disapointed that I did not want to believe this. This alone says a lot about the pedestal we put regular people on just for being famous but he did look like a clean individual on the surface and a part of me wanted to look like this facade.

I'm a 22yo, still learning how to be a better version of myself everyday and now that the silence is broken and that we know all that he has done, it kind of makes me doubt every male role model that I've ever had.

In my mind I still have Kendrick Lamar for instance, adressing racism in his lyrics, enpowering black people all around the world while showing kids you can be cool without alcohol and weed (which is pretty hard as a rapper). But what if he is not that guy either? What if every role model I can think of is actually shitty because we're all shitty in a way? What if my own father, that has been the backbone of me growing up, what if he is shady as well?

So yeah, I wanted to know, how do you guys cope with revelations like these about anyone that has disapointed you in a way, be it a celebrity or someone in your surroundings?",True,40,0.93,29,,/r/MensLib/comments/hd3f2c/im_confused_about_male_role_models/,Crikripex

I know they're doing this on purpose at a time where all of our energy is elsewhere from protesting police brutality against black people, to the new (thankfully postive) ruling by the supreme court that protects LGBT people from job discrimination. It's also Pride month and was released on the anniversary of the Pulse Club shooting. I haven't heard about this new rule that the Trump administration has put out anywhere expect in LGBT spaces. So, I want to get the word out there as this could affect me and many of my friends in a very negative way. 


Basically, the rule says that trans people can be discriminated against by any health care provider, including insurance. This reminds me of back in the day when I thought I was a lesbian (I'm a bisexual trans man) and health care providers were allowed to discriminate against all LGBT people due to ""religious beliefs."" Thankfully, it seems that no one will stand for LGB discrimination anymore. But discrimination against trans people is still alive and well. I'm reliant on multiple medications and doctors for both my transition and other issues. If doctors and my insurance can reject me outright, then I could very well die. This is especially heinous as we're in the middle of a pandemic. This could lead to even more severe issues for an already very vulnerable minority. 


What worries me most though is that I haven't seen this talked about much anywhere. I want to try to get people together to fight this. We have 60 days as of the time of them announcing this rule change (it was released on June 12th, 2020) to fight this. *And we can.* Write your representatives in Washington. I'll help you figure out who they are and what to write if you're wanting to write them. Please, do it for our sake. There aren't enough trans people in the world to make a big enough ruckus about this. This is what we need allies for.

2020-06-19 05:43:53,being a trans guy and experiencing a lack of emotional support,"hey, everyone!

I'm not sure how to phrase this exactly, or how to make this a fancy properly structured post, but in short, transitioning into male has isolated me emotionally and made it harder to experience a sense of close friendship. I feel less like part of a collective and more solitary in my own head. 

I know we can all agree that it's unhealthy that we treat guys like this. that your feelings are yours and yours alone, and that you'll always be a separate entity completely to anybody other than maybe a romantic partner. I don't know what it's like to be raised that way as a young kid. but I know what it's like to have healthy expectations of what I can and can't handle alone and what connections to other people should look like, and then having that taken away from me. that's the hard part of transitioning, not the medical costs and procedures, or people's anti-trans BS per se.

At one point I tried to detransition as a result of this. I needed that back. but I was too dysphoric and I still definitely prefer this. I just wish it wasn't like this. 

I didn't decide to feel this way for the sake of being ""manly"". I didn't deliberate anything. I never deliberated learning to sit or speak in more masculine ways either. it just happened through immersion. the fact that it's not something I've experienced forever, and just had handed to me as a result of transitioning, (probably) makes it feel even worse.

is there a way to break this programming? if we obtain isolating mindsets through immersion in society, how can we deprogram that without paradoxically isolating ourselves more?

2020-06-16 06:53:19,Protein shakes in night bars/clubs? Dropping a gender biased view on protein. (Arrrgh so manly!),"Hey everyone!

I am male, 23 years and striving to drop my gender biased ideas.

The  reason for creating this post, and I hope this is the right place, is that I want to reflect on a perspective that I recently had an idea on and would love to hear what others think about it too.

**I thought, that protein shakes at night clubs would be a nice thing.**

I love to work out and to also spend spend time with my friends, going out dancing and having amazing memories at nights.  
So some days when I've worked out and I am out partying, I don't drink, because on the one hand, alcohol reduces muscle growth and on the other  to me it is a form of self care, since alcohol is literally a poison,  thus not really healthy and often times I feel miserable afterwards.  
So, I really would have enjoyed a protein shake at the bar, since I wasn't drinking.

But  as soon as the idea came up, I jugded it for being a ""man's"" thought  and that others would smile about it (which alot of people nonetheless  will). I **imagined** that certain people, mainly women, would laugh at me and that my thought was  just a remain of my old toxic views about myself and the toxic  masculinity/patriarchy. Something like ""Haha I am so manly I need to  drink my protein shake everywhere"".

But really, this is just a hoax. It is just a protein shake.

With every cell I respect every other person in the night club drinking alcohol and having the time of their live, damn I love it! I'd clink  glasses with everybody that wants to and beat them in a dance battle  afterwards. But I feel, most would react biased if I suggested it.

I feel that the image of the protein shake is just so tied to toxic masculinity. ***Wouldn't a super sport ambitious woman that loves to dance at night clubs enjoy a protein shake there too?*** Fuck, let's take care of ourselves and our bodies, why not? Protein is there for everybody in the end..

So, what is bad about me having a protein shake at the night club, really, while I am fully supporting and loving you? I consider myself a ""feminist"" and would love to hear your thoughts on this, as I can't think of a reason for it being a bad thing.

Love and greetings

I'm hardly a guru or a qualified psychiatrist on this issue, it's more that I recently realized this is a huge personal blindspot in my knowledge: I feel like we hear a lot about AMAB men's issues, and women's issues, and trans women's issues, but pretty much never trans men's issues. It seems to me, from my probably limited born-and-identifying-male perspective, that society and the media rarely if ever discuss or represent trans men in any way, positive or negative. I do know that, if I remember the statistics correctly, trans people are at much greater risk of violence and hate crimes than the rest of the population, but I can't remember for sure whether that was referring exclusively to trans women or to trans people in general.

 It's perhaps one of the great ironies of our lexicon that ""transgender"" (I'm not sure whether or not you guys consider that to be a pejorative term, but I've definitely heard it used in a very derogatory tone) seems to be pretty much exclusively used, and understood to be, in reference to MtF folks and never FtTm. ""Transgender"" and ""trans woman"", when they appear in the mainstream media at all, seem to be pretty synonymous, and as a straight dude I feel like I lack both the knowledge and the expertise to speculate on why that may be.

2020-06-14 12:33:05,"A general post about kilts, bc I wear them often and am seeing interest on this ub about them","So, a lot of this is going to be taken from a comment I made in a post that was put up last week. Kilts are absolutely amazing garments, and if you can get over your fear of doing it (you just have to do it and commit to it) then it can do quite a few good things for you. Here's the comment, plus some new stuff at the end:      

i wear kilts often. not utilikilts. tartan kilts, with long socks (dont have hose or ties sadly). people are suggesting and saying a lot ab kilts that isnt entirely accurate. Ill break that down below!

    Kilts actually are fantastic in hot weather. Wool is a natural fiber, and while it insulates well in cold, it also feels better than shorts/pants in very hot weather. Go to this site (http://www.xmarksthescot.com/forum/forum.php) and read up on it. I lack the ability to explain it myself, but the people in that forum are very knowledgable and helpful. Many people, myself included, wear 8-yard, 16 oz kilts year-round. I live in Tx, and its hot as ballsssssssss rn. But when Im a kilt, I feel great. No issues!

    I have encountered many men who love the kilt, as well as women. Men tell me they wish they could wear one, and i always really try to encourage that. I have encountered literally no one who has ever said anything negative to me, and if they do, screw them. I do it bc I enjoy it, bc it helps me stay in touch with my Irish roots (yes the Irish wore kilts too, they started a bit after Scotland did), and, in my own way, to fight against traditional masculinity.

    Kilts are not just formal use attire. They just became that way after the Highland Clearances, when they started slowwwwly being worn by nobility after much ado was made about King George IV visiting Scotland, and thats also when they started being viewed as 'romantic, nostalgic,' etc. Burns Suppers came about not terribly long after that, and so the kilt was (still is, for many Scots) relelgated to formal use. But it was not always that way. The Great Kilt, or Feilidh Mor, was in use probably around since the early 16th century. Later, it got reduced to the Small Kilt, or Feilidh Beag, though the Great Kilt was still worn regularly. They were worn for.. well, most everythnig except horse riding, that I can recall reading about. They were practical, useful garments, that being wool, were very effective against Scottish winters. Today, amongst quite a few people (again, refer to X Marks, they are a great, great resource) there is a feeling that kilts should be used for everyday general wear, and I am among those people.

    No, Scots generally don't care if you wear one. Most of them that I have met are in fact very flattered and appreciative of the fact that people are wanting to wear something that is a part of their history.       

    No, you do not HAVE to ' go commando'. That is not and has never been a requirement except for British Army soldiers, and I cannot even remember the reason why. Personally, I prefer wearing underwear under them, because It's more hygienic that way. But that's me, YMMV. As far as people asking what you wear under there, you can play that off in quite a few ways. i typically say 'socks and shoes', gets a good chuckle usually. Other guys might be coy, say stuff like 'lipstick' or 'its all in perfect working order', etc. As far as being kilt-checked, that has yet to happen to me (thank GODDD) but when/if it does, Ill ask them 'if i were a woman, would you have done what you just did?'. Because people can forget basic human decency sometimes, saying that usually sobers them up pretty well. Hope I dont have to deal with it tho.       

Kilts are cool, guys. REALLY cool, in fact. They will help you break out of your shell, bc you WILL be talked to by people about them. They will be hard to wear at first, bc remember youre fighting yearsssssss of social norms. But youll get used to it, and after that, it just becomes part of who you are. If you want to get one, go to X Marks (linking it again here http://www.xmarksthescot.com/forum/forum.php) and use the people they sponsor. You will find that Traditional kilts are not cheap, as they are mostly handmade, with lots of skilled labor going into them. USA Kilts (https://www.usakilts.com/) is FANTASTIC if you're in America. They do offer casual kilts in P/V that are great if you wanna dip your toes in w/o breaking the bank. I hope this clears up a lot of the innaccurate info being strewn about in here. P.S. this past weekend I wore mine to the mall. I got a whistle or two, some odd looks (especially from young teens), but mostly I got smiles or compliments. One older black man in particular was really into it, said 'Dig the kilt, brother!'. That experience reflects 98% of interactions I've had while kilted. Bc people will usually want to talk to you ab it, it can be a great way to help yourself come out of your shell! It's also a great way to fight against gender norms and is especially effective against toxic-masculinity-minded men. If you're drawn to it, *do* it. SO many guys come up and are like 'dude, i wanna do that!', and it's great helping them out with that, encouraging that aspect of them. It's so, so worth it to give it a shot, and you will certainly feel better about yourself for it. Hope this helps ome people out, and if anyone wants to talk ab anything related to them, I'd be happy to help that!

2020-06-13 04:09:58,My awesome partner's way of reprogramming himself into becoming more aware of sharing the mental load of running the household. Maybe this helps some of you as well!,"I (a woman) am in a long term relationship with with my partner (a man). From the start, I've always felt we've been very aware and focused on building an egalitarian relationship. Societal gender programming is hard to get rid of, however, and as hard as it is to admit, we both suffer from some subconscious gender role issues despite our hard work on trying to get rid of that programming.

In particular, this post is about household chores and how women are generally programmed to take more on of the mental load for these jobs. In our relationship, I generally don't need to 'instruct' my partner to contribute. He'll do plenty of chores out of his own volition and when he sees me working on chores, he'll always look around to see what other chore he can do or what he can do to help me out (without depending on me to tell him what to do).

What we've noticed in the last months, however, is that when things go *wrong* I will always blame *myself*. For example, if laundry hasn't been done in a while and were missing certain items, or when suddenly were overwhelmed in chores because we've been lagging behind.

By SO noticed how often I would make comments like 'I should have done laundry earlier this week', 'I should have thought about taking out food from the freezer earlier today', 'I should have made sure to have planned more time to vacuum yesterday already'. Etc etc etc. My SO commented how these thoughts of me taking implicit responsibility for things 'going wrong' in our household are a result of unconscious gender bias, and he's not having it.

Every. Single. Time he'll hear me say something like that he will now correct me; 'No, WE should have thought about doing laundry earlier. We're both responsible for making sure these things get done.' 

Change the language, change the thinking, change the subconscious bias. His approach is making HIM feel responsible for the mental load where before, he wasn't too aware of it, while it's forcing ME to really address the mental load as a shared responsibility, instead of something that is exclusively mine to deal with.",True,2169,0.96,77,,/r/MensLib/comments/h7s4n5/my_awesome_partners_way_of_reprogramming_himself/,-Avacyn

2020-06-11 21:24:24,Revisiting a Pervasive Topic: Aging and Loneliness in Men.,"So I just finished watching The Ritual, and it reminded me that far too often traditional modes of masculinity fail to help men maintain healthy relatonships past the age of 30 and leave men with few options to connect to the world if they find themselves alone. Too often men feel alienated even when in a crowd, because the boundaries they built for their relationships don't allow them to talk about the things that they really need to talk about.

I imagine we all have that dad or that grandfather, whose only connection to the world is family and a few old colleagues that they barely talk about anything of consequence with but just have a beer with once in a while for 'old times sake' as if their life has already passed and everything now revolves around the glory days where they were integrated in a community and valued for their work. Sometimes this works great if you have a large family and still have stuff to do in it like handywork and such. Generally I find it to be a very inflexible model for male happiness in aging, though.

I wanted to hear some perspectives from all you fine folks here, and I wanna cast a broad net so that we can all feel like we can contribute in some way to a conversation about loneliness and masculinity.  I wanna hear positive stories about how you connected with the world, I wanna hear about the time you were stuck in life, and felt like no one could relate to you or you had no one to turn to. I want to hear what you think insulated you against the typical problems other men face, what could exasterbate them, what kinds of solutions you personally found, and what you think could be done systemically to fasciliate integrating men into social circles. In ways that aren't just healthy for them but for everyone else to.

Or literally any other thought you've had recently. Especially if you have a good piece of literature that can get me started on exploring this topic. It's just quite interesting to me. As a person rushing towards 30, I don't want to become this stereotype.",True,747,0.99,129,,/r/MensLib/comments/h0z8vp/revisiting_a_pervasive_topic_aging_and_loneliness/,Sturdy_Stiles
2020-06-12 01:05:37,"An addendum to the earlier discussion about autism and men, inspired by something that's happened to me recently.","So, I have a friend. This friend of mine, who happens to be female, has a *very* similar cocktail of mental and physical issues to the one I have, to such an extent that we're seeing the same exact therapist for the same exact reason, while taking the same exact kind of medicine.

Looks like this friend's got a boyfriend now, and finding out about it made me feel sick, despite the fact that I would *never* make a move on her - I'm aware of the fact we'd be a horror show as a couple, and I like her too much as a friend to even consider making a move on her, anyway.

So, why did I react like I was some kind of incel? Well, it didn't take long for me to find the answer: this guy - whom I know, not very well, but enough to know he's a chill dude - is quite tall and perfectly proportioned on one hand, and very eloquent and funny on the other hand. Compare and contrast with me, a guy who's on the frail side and quite short on one hand, and kind of weird as well as painfully introverted on the other hand.

So, it looks like even among socially challenged people, there seems to be a very definite hierarchy, and those who are more ""normal"" are higher on it. After all, I wasn't the one making gay jokes about her until she told me to stop it, *she* was the one making gay jokes about me until I told her to stop it - and this, when she was right in the middle of her ""no one will ever love me and I will die alone"" phase. 

Also, she thinks Lestat from the Anne Rice novels is husband material rather than an abusive creep, but that's yet another can of worms. XD",True,39,0.88,8,,/r/MensLib/comments/h13bgc/an_addendum_to_the_earlier_discussion_about/,Ulmicola

2020-06-10 14:02:41,Devaluation of autistic men's masculinity,"sorry that this isn't really an effortpost, as the kids say. I'm in bed on my phone about 30 minutes past when I was going to sleep in the first place. This has been eating me up for a while.

I'm an autistic trans dude. when I'm by myself, and I can wear and do whatever, I feel free and masculine, and completely non-dysphoric a lot of the time. But then I feel like I need to ""mask"" around other people to be valued as a man.

I'm not quite an adult yet legally, but I know that many autistic adults are basically thought of as adult children. ""stimming"" is for kids. obsessions and geeky special interests are for kids. blah blah blah. we're supposed to adapt to a world that is fundamentally not ""made of"" us. and many autistic people have slowed or stunted development in some areas where it may take them longer or never to reach independence. but even if and when we are independent-- or otherwise-- adults in society, we're not treated as ""really"" adults. 

Keep in mind, I fit a lot of the stereotypes, I guess, for a ""high-functioning"" (I certainly have my grievances with the popular usages of that term, though) autistic teenager. I like anime, I love video games, I'm extremely online(tm), I get needlessly attached to various fictional characters and associate myself with them, I'm fairly obsessive, I'm easily very overstimulated, I love data and statistics, I'm very sexually driven, I have issues handling strong emotions of really any kind, etc.
I also stim very frequently by galloping around and/or vestibular input, preferably with music.
maybe I can get away with ""masking"" as just being a bit eccentric, but there's no way for me to know that. nobody's gonna confirm out if nowhere that they think I'm autistic.

As a trans guy, and a generally pretty socially observant person (the opposite being a stereotype I personally can't relate to as an individual), I feel like ""manhood"" and ""boyhood"" are opposing concepts in ways that ""womanhood"" and ""girlhood"" aren't. y'know, you man up, you get the girl, you bring home the bacon. obviously it's a lot more nuanced then that but there's a concept of ""coming of age"" that applies to men and not women. and ""boys"" are comparatively feminized as young males do not often have many physically masculine sexual characteristics (depending on, like, a lot, though, of course). but it's not all about your actual physical or mental age, it's about meeting the standards for manhood. how often do you hear people standoffishly tell girls or women to ""grow up""? not that it never happens, of course, but there's more weight on telling that to a guy. because the only difference between a ""girl"" and a ""woman"" is age.

I can't control having Special Interests(tm) or needing to stim by galloping or riding a swing with my earbuds in. I can't mask any of that forever at all. I can't magically decide not to be completely disoriented by stimulus that I didn't will into my own senses (I can be listening to loud music and playing an intense game with flashy dynamic visuals and it'll be great, but then my mom will come in and I become angry and burnt out because I didn't ""invite"" the new stimulus). but I'm personally capable of making independent decisions and thinking critically, being independent in caring for myself, etc. It's taken me longer to get here because of the speed at which I happened to develop those traits, but I am developing them and will come of age. I will be an adult, not an eternal child.

I know people on this sub are fond of the Pop Culture Detective video about Big Bang Theory and masculinity. it's been a while since I've seen that particular video, so I don't remember if or how much he touched on this, but Sheldon's autistic stereotype character is effectively used as shorthand for ""childish, geeky sex pest"". it's a more brazen gatekeep of his masculinity than that of the other main characters, I think. his disability is supposed to be *why* he's not a ""real man"". (which is... weird, honestly, since in Young Sheldon they use the savant stereotype to typecast him as the opposite, an adult child, prettymuch.)

Why does this body-shaming nonsense have to be pulled into this?

I find it especially confusing because I keep seeing people say penis size doesn't matter, but yet having a small one is negative?

I'm just baffled male body shaming is so excepted in society that these types of signs are made and shared online with no one batting an eye. 

Context

I'm a cis/het black man living in NY and I know that there are bigger fish to fry. I had a similar problem with the whole big dick energy when that became a thing. As someone who struggles with body positivity seeing shit like this just confirms the idea that men should strive for the male ideal body shown throughout media. It's getting hard to trust shows of male body positivity as it's starting to feel preformative. Like it's nice when I see it, but you know you'd be better off going with the media's ideal male body.

TBH I could keep going about my feelings on this, but I feel like that should be a different post.

Long time lurker on this sub - really glad that we have a place to have some great discussion on the issues that men face and how we can be allies for the people in our lives that aren't as privileged as we are.

**TLDR**

I've created a counselling/coaching service called [TalkFreely](https://www.talkfreely.uk/) that connects you to a counsellor in India. This service costs 25USD per session, so it's affordable. If you're brown (Arab/South Asian/Latino), you'll have the added benefit of talking to someone who understands our family dynamics.

If you're in the Middle East, click [here](https://www.talkfreely.uk/nri)

If you're in the UK, click [here](https://www.talkfreely.uk/gb-nri).

If you're anywhere else and want to use this, please send an email to [help@talkfreely.uk](mailto:help@talkfreely.uk)

Note that **while this is targeted at South Asians and Arabs**, we have users that are of other cultural backgrounds who benefit from this service, purely because it is **affordable** and it seems like **more** ties us together than divides us.

**The Long Version**

I've struggled with depression for a **very long time**. However I only realized it when I ended up in hospital for it at the age of 20.

Since then, I've had two formative experiences that motivated my idea

1. While working in San Francisco, I switched insurance providers. The therapist that I had worked so hard to build a solid relationship with started to cost me $80 an hour, versus the previous $20 an hour. This happens to a lot of people all around the world - in the UK many are stuck in waiting lines waiting for their follow on session, in Hong Kong and in the UAE, sessions can cost as much as $200 an hour and in other countries like Bahrain, there are simply not enough counsellors available.
2. I then moved to India (I am of Indian descent), where I started to see somebody who **understood my culture**. For the South Asians/Arabs on this sub, you'll know where I'm coming from - she was able to help me navigate some solid personal boundaries with my parents and helped me push back on some uncomfortable questions like ""When can we get you an arranged marriage?""

As a result, I decided to start TalkFreely. The idea behind this is two fold

1. Getting help has \*never been affordable\*. I want to take away the resource barrier to get help, but I want to do it sustainably (I'm 100% not made of money).
2. For my fellow Brown folk (Arabs, South Asians and interestingly, Latinos use this service), you'll get to talk to someone who additionally **understands where you're coming from**.

I'm currently serving users in a few countries and am trying to grow this service because I'd like to get more people access. **Unfortunately,** most of my users are women. Men tend to not talk about their feelings and this is a **really big problem**.

Hopefully some of you will sign up! Feel free to DM me for any questions or hit me up at [help@talkfreely.uk](mailto:help@talkfreely.uk)",True,88,0.95,6,,/r/MensLib/comments/gyxgqc/affordable_desi_arab_counselling_service_for/,karna852

To preface: I am not a debate guru or a politician or even an interventionist. I am just a dude who likes engaging in arguments/discussions effectively (its a hobby, I've been told I'm good at it). This is all anecdotal so take it with a grain of salt. If someone who is much smarter than I knows of research backing anything I've said (or even better, disproving anything and gives tips on how to get the message across) please comment and I'll link it in the post. This will be the first time I've ever written down my technique, apologies in advance if I cant really put it down clearly. I'll try my best to clear up any confusion in the comments.

When deciding to engage in an argument or discussion, one should gauge if they have the knowledge base to engage effectively. You might feel passionately about something, but if you arent totally educated on a topic that you want to argue then you will need to do your research. The other person may have been indoctrinating themselves for years, decades even, before you met and you will need to be just as versed in the counter point as they are. Some topics are easier to argue because of the vast well of respected and accepted knowledge about them. Others might not be, either because of suppression or because of the recent discovery. Either way, you must be educated before you decide to speak on something.

If you meet that requirement, your first step is to listen and try to understand the feeling behind the words. You can't truly argue something without knowing how the person feels about it. They could be feeling isolation, fear, anger, resentment and any number of emotions to feel the way they do about something. Your job is to identify those feelings because you cant dispel their narratives without also acknowledging their feelings. Emotion is tied to everyone's beliefs, good and bad. Addressing their emotions while addressing the narrative is important, but you cannot address the emotion directly. That is the tricky part. Let me explain:

A narrative is sometimes the only way that people can express their emotions. A belief is put forth to protect the emotion, so bringing up the emotion directly is to address themselves as a person. That will be seen as a personal attack and they go into defense. The argument will not be effective at that point. Attack the shield not the person. 

Example:
""I hate black people."" Why?
""Because they are criminals."" So you're afraid that they'll hurt you or your family?
""No, I never said that! You're making me out to be a racist!"" 

Its a lazy example I know but I dont know how they think and its the only thing I can come up with. Disarm the argument, then calm their emotions. To disarm the argument you need facts, research and fact checking. If they bring up something you know is false, Google it and show them the results. Their response might be that its fake news but the seed you've planted will stay there and will only get nurtured the longer you keep talking to them. Keep bringing up facts, statistics, nationally recognized studies and those roots will start to take hold.

I should caution against this next bit that if you arent good at coming up with analogies, its best you steer clear. I am not the best at it but if I see a perfect analogy online, I memorize it to pull out if its pertinent. Pepper in a few good analogies to really drive home a point in a way they wouI'd understand, but use it sparingly. Only use an analogy if it is directly pertinent to the point you are making and you already fleshed it out so there can be no misunderstanding of the point you're making.

Lastly, do not lose your cool. This is probably the hardest thing to do, especially when arguing morality issues such as racism or sexism. You will need to keep your head under all circumstances. If you lose your temper, you've lost the argument. It will be a battleground of emotions, not ideas. You also need to avoid attacking the person through things like name-calling or saying an idea is stupid. Once you start doing that, you move away from the validity of the argument into attacking their identity. Dont do it.

Its hard for me to put this down into words because I've never really examined the method until now. It might not be right for everyone and this is in no way a standard golden method. Its not effective for everything, and I dont expect it to be. It also places a large burden on yourself because the other party has no obligation to fight fair. I've lost my cool a couple times here in the past week especially. If you dont have the energy to engage, simply dont engage and take care of yourself. There's no shame is saying, ""I'm not educated enough on that subject to give an answer"". Take care of what you can, dont worry about the rest. I hope this guide can help someone out and please feel free to amend it to your style. 

Stay safe out there everyone

Edit: I forgot to mention that its also important to judge if the other person has the mental and emotional maturity to hear your position and actually try to understand it. If they aren't taking the conversation seriously, don't waste your time. If they are trying to defend their position, keep working on them. Dont interrupt them when they are talking (no matter how offensive) and demand that same respect from them. Its a delicate thing, dont let them derail it. It also usually works better in one on one conversations as a group will usually provide too many points to counter.",True,49,0.95,7,,/r/MensLib/comments/gyooij/in_response_to_those_that_have_or_might_ask_about/,IM_neurotoxin

Hello all.  This past week has awful and I was trying to find some message to help get thru to the cops that these issues are valid and that they need to just quit being awful people.  Initially my thoughts were ""if they don't care now, make it personal to them"".  


Father's Day is coming up, and while I am not on good terms with mine, when I was growing up I hated disappointing my father.  I was wondering if it would be a good idea to see if we (protestors) could contact any of the local-to-us officer's father's in hopes that they would come down to the front lines and stand up for their fellow humans, and reach out to their sons*. Make them see we are all the same.  Or in reddit terms, ""Remember the human"".

I thought to post it on reddit, maybe in trollx, protests, or BLM.  However, when I was searching for an image/gif of fathers and sons, I came up really shorthanded.  Are there really that few happy moments online of dads and kids? (r/dadreflexes not really the right sentiment!)  Do you gents have any great images or moments that would help describe these feelings? And what do you think of the idea of fathers coming out to ask their sons to stand down?

2020-06-07 20:27:50,Being a Man with a Disability,"So I am going to start of the bat by identifying myself as a disabled white gay trans man with PTSD. Just so we all are on the same page. 

I am pretty good with the gay and trans part. I’ve reconciled those parts and owning a queer masculinity feels good and right to me. 

The disabled part I struggle with a lot. 

I struggled with how my chronic illnesses affect me prior to transition so it’s not a new issue for me but masculinity adds an incredibly complex layer. 

I will give a specific example that’s sort of kicking me in the gut right now. 

I went to a march yesterday as a street medic. I have the skills and experience and if the only thing I can do right now is keep a couple other people safe, then that is what I can do and should do. This is not a time for my voice to be heard but for my hands to serve. 

I was smart. I found an affinity group of other people with skills. We spent time planning and choosing how we would do this, what marches to attend, what risk we would take. Great stuff. 

Get there day of and I am the only one who has acted as a street medic for more than this week. (I have done this since Occupy because I care about my activists.) Because of this, i was made point person for cop watching, which is obviously very important and fairly dangerous right now but we agreed I have almost ten years of experience of police related situational awareness and should do it. 

Five hours in and my disabilities caught up with me. I knew if I didn’t leave then, I would end up in the ER. Between the heat related migraine and my inability to regulate my own body heat, I was very close to being unable to stand. As it was, even right now, I haven’t been able to eat a full meal for 24 hours. (Plenty of fluida and electrolytes I promise. This is typical for these flares for me.)

I hate not being able to do a thing. This was true prior to transition and more true now. I am a Type A personality and tend to push through and crash after. I also feel like a giant heel for taking on an important job and then just needing to leave. 

I hate feeling weak and I do think the whole burden of masculinity makes that worse. Lien I should be able to do more. The episodes make me confused and stupid (real side effect) which also makes me feel less masculine. (Side clarification: note: not “like a woman” but “less masculine” which are two different things. I was raised as a woman and lived as a woman. I know what that feels like and this is not that. This is less masculine, like I’m not performing masculinity well.)

I also do a lot of work to feel embodied in my body as a man. It might seem counterintuitive but it is a big part of my transition. Whether it’s yoga or therapy or meditation or taking my testosterone, it’s important to me to feel grounded in my masculine body. Top surgery was the absolute best for that. Between how these episodes make me confused, stupid (yes real side effect, not bad self talk), and dizzy and how the medications make me feel high, it can take days for me to feel like I’m back in my body. And that is wildly unpleasant and a struggle around gender. 

Tl;dr: I have a variety of chronic illnesses that will periodically flare up, sometimes in unison, and impair my ability to function as an adult human and it makes me feel like I am not performing masculinity well or at all.",True,59,0.9,7,,/r/MensLib/comments/gybglw/being_a_man_with_a_disability/,grayperegrine

Interesting thing I've notice was that we all practiced and still practice combat sports. As the topic of respect and equality came in, many people started talking how when ypu are about to have a match or a sparing practice, you are suppose to enter the fight as equal opponents. This notion of respect did help many of us to improve our view of ourselves and people around us.


Also, many men spoke about how combat sports, tho persived as violent and hyper masculin, didn't have a baggage of toxic masculinity and manbox many people think they do. There was a particular guy who talked about how his coach was one of the best examples of man he could ever have got in his life.


I think combat sports are a good place to start, since they fulfill the role of validating certain masculin traits, so that people can be more open to other possibilities and changes to male identity.

 Do you people agree? What are your experiences with these types of sports?

Edit: I should point out that in my country most sport clubs are mixed, so man and women would train and share spaces with each other, and ratio of male and female coaches is mostly 60:40 or so (not allways, but mostly).",True,50,0.95,15,,/r/MensLib/comments/gybr9x/martial_artscombat_sports_and_positive_masculinity/,OrdinarySlav

2020-06-07 18:03:32,Advice on how to navigate retail voice,"I know the title here may seem a bit off for this sub, but I believe this may be a great place to look for advice from other men.

I’m a trans male, 1 year into my transition, and pass a good portion of the time. The problem comes in here with retail voice. Socially it seems women are expected to be EXTRA polite and cheery, and it’s been a hard habit to break for me in my transition and often leads to being misgendered. I know men also have a “retail voice” where the voice itself gets pitched up for cheeriness, but I’m not sure how to correctly fix my pitch and annunciation without pitching my voice much lower and possibly coming across as cold or hostile. I’ve tried to work on emulating my other male coworkers but it’s a bit tricky as we all have very distinct pitches and personalities when interacting with customers.

Again, I’m not sure if this is the best place to ask this, but I do like learning from the experiences of cis men in how you navigate expectations, specifically in the retail space right now.

When after I get my Msc degree I plan on opening a series of schools.

These schools will be different from other schools though as I plan to focus on issues I feel the education community is not addressing e.g mental health of students, bullying, and sexism.

When it comes to misogyny, I hope to teach students about some of the well achieving women in history. When it comes to misandry, I am not entirely sure what to do.

Obviously I will do my best to discourage toxic masculinity, as I believe teaching boys to be toxic is abusive and detrimental to them. But I feel like I need to go deeper then that.

In some countries, e.g USA, boys are scoring less then girls on their various tests, on average. Some say that this is due to schools being biased against boys, but I had my doubts (mostly because it was a prageru video and those idiots wont have a problem with the reverse) so what do you think is causing this?

2020-06-05 20:39:22,Black with an average dick but never feeling it's enough,"Posted this in /averagedickproblems but I thought here would also be good to get some advice:

I'm black with an average sized dick, I'm not going to whip out a tape measure and give you the exact measurements, but if I were to estimate I'd say I'm 5-6 inches.

Despite knowing, intellectually, that:

* Bigger doesn't mean better and I should be happy my dick would be compatible with most vaginas
* The dicks you see in most porn (BBC or otherwise) aren't a true representation of reality due to camera angles and male actors with big dicks are specifically requested
* Black men having a BBC is a stereotype and harmful to place that expectation on yourself
* I pleasure the woman I'm seeing well despite my average size and she's never, to my knowledge, had any complaints. She's very much in love with me.

I still feel like I want an extra inch or two. Why? Ego and insecurity. Will getting those extra inches solve my problems? I don't know, probably not, but the knowledge of knowing you're big, and the aesthetics of fucking someone with a big dick or having it bigger than your hand, is awesome to me. When I watch porn, which 99% of the time involves a BBC because I'm black and want to relate to the actor, I love the sight of the actress taking those inches, especially in certain positions, or even needing two hands to hold it. When I try to do the same positions (doggy, etc.) with my woman, I find my dick isn't long enough for me to do it effectively (or perhaps it's the angle? idk), I keep slipping out and I feel bad when it happens. And despite knowing I'm a big guy with big hands, when I hold it in my own hand I still feel like I come up short.

I think to some degree I equate having a BBC with an identity of a strong, powerful black male and I realise it's not healthy to internalise that.

1. Wouldn't it negate non-binary gender if we create a dividing line on the gender spectrum between the binary choice of those who benefit from oppression and those who don't?
2. Where would such a dividing line even go? Would a man who identifies as ""two-spirit"" and presents as female be on the female side of the line? Would a woman who presents as masculine be on the side that gains privilege?
3. Who would decide where such a dividing line would go? Would everybody have their own conflicting idea of where such a line would go, thus making it arbitrary?
4. Being further on the edge of the spectrum doesn't seem to correlate with privilege at all. The proverbial ""rich straight old white male"" has more privilege than the hypermasculine extreme of the spectrum. Women anywhere else in the gender spectrum have more privilege than a trans woman closer to the middle of the spectrum.

2020-05-29 01:46:57,Getting a insider look into patriarchy and the impacts it has on men (from the perspective of a transgender man),"*for context: I’m a transgender man who transitioned in 2016. I’m read as a guy in all parts of my life and live stealth without disclosing my trans status the majority of the time. I’m part of a men’s group that I am out to and they accept me as just another guy. I initially posted it in a trans sub and it was suggested that it might be a good fit here as well. 

Last night I took a deep dive into patriarchy and privilege with my men’s group and walked away with some powerful nuggets of knowledge. Listening to the experiences of the other men and the presenter, there have been some benefits in my own life to not having been socialized male and I think that has a net-positive impact on the man I am and how I show up in the world. I wouldn’t say I was socialized female per se, because I didn’t fit into that box at all, but I definitely didn’t get the messages boys do as they grow up either. And having life experience on both sides gives me a super unique perspective on the world and how instantaneous of a shift it was once I was definitively read as male by the world- how I was treated by men, women, and humans in general. Instant privilege once I was seen as an educated white male. And being able to share that experience was super powerful to get the point across to the other guys. 

I think the biggest benefit for me has been that I’ve essentially gone through life without the “man” rule book and have had to make it up as I go. Rather than be told how I’m supposed to act, I can pick how I want to act based on what I’ve have experienced and what feels right to me. I don’t feel like I need to outcompete others or make them look small so I seem big, view people as objects or conquests to be collected, or feel like I need to be stoic and unfeeling all the time. I can watch other men and pick and choose what traits I want to use in my own life and sort of cherry pick the good and leave the bad. I haven’t had the pressures or expectation of society shoved down my throat for decades and can evolve as I want to. 

Listening to some of the men share, there are a lot of negatives to patriarchy and how it impacts men that I had no idea of. A lot of shame, anger, sadness, and guilt about how they show up in the world because of what they’ve been told and taught. It was really eye-opening to see the negative side of masculinity when that has been all I’ve wanted my entire life. It was also interesting to see the connection I’ve noticed on here where trans guys will celebrate those moments of patriarchy as milestones in passing and being accepted into the world as a man. Or when they over-compensate for not knowing how to interact by being as masculine as they possibly can and put on a show to fit in rather than just being genuine. Because I’ve done that too. 

I’m glad I had the opportunity to sit in and participate in the discussion because I walked away more informed about the topic and its impacts as well as having an new level of appreciation for my own life and experience. If I was born cis-male and raised as a boy, I likely wouldn’t be who I am today. I think I would have had a totally different social life, especially in high school likely getting in with the jock guys, and those formative years would have squished my sense of self and worth in ways that cannot be unsquished. While I’d love to be cis, I know that will never happen. My past has shaped me, both the good and the bad, and I’m happy with who I am and how I show up in the world. As much as I thought boys had it easy growing up, I was completely shielded from this part of the male experience and had no idea what even went on. I think it would be a lot harder to be a good man after growing up with those expectations and it gave me a new appreciation for the good guys in my life that have gone outside the typical man mold.",True,147,0.93,25,,/r/MensLib/comments/gsaxd2/getting_a_insider_look_into_patriarchy_and_the/,Chunky_pickle

2020-05-28 05:02:19,"It really bothers me how there is this paradigm, that sexualising every creative content is something, that men should not only be okay with, but they should love it (f.e. Animes)","I cannot count how many times i have found a new anime, with a cool story, cool concept, animation and artstile...that i stop watching after one or two episodes, because over all of these great aspects there is this HUGE sexualisted and sexist mantle of making every women in this show an objectified big boobed 14 year old (btw wtf?!). 

But it's not just there, there are sooo many unnecessary situations in movies, tv shows etc, where erotic is implemented in a plump and distracting way, just so that men ""will pay attention"", deep character moments but at the same time one of the female characters has a HUGE cleavage and she has to stand in an obvious uncomfortable way, just so that it is displayed in the biggest possible way f.e.

Yes i am a men, and attracted to women, yes i am oftentimes horny, but that does not mean, that i want erotic fantasies to invade every aspect of my life. When i would want to watch something erotic, i would explicitly do that. It undermines the story, it kills my immersion.

Everytime someone thinks, he/she (but most times he) has to include those things i feel like reduced to a mindless sex driven ape, and the worst thing is, there are way too many men who really think that way. Most of my male friends look at me totally confused when i don't want to see the actress in the movie in a swim suit or something like that. 

There is this huge expectation, that if i don't enjoy it, i should just ignore it. But for me it kills a lot of moments. So please, if it doesn't serve the story, just leave it out.",True,295,0.97,115,,/r/MensLib/comments/grsa83/it_really_bothers_me_how_there_is_this_paradigm/,Altain2010

While I highly suggest everyone watch it, her main point is that what men need more than anything is a **""positive ideal of 21st-century manhood"".** Earlier in the video, she points out that while women's rights have been mostly successful in moving womanhood out of the ""domestic servitude"" gender role, men's role in society as the expendable provider remains somewhat stagnant. 

In the past, men were expected to be muscular, stoic providers, but as that standard becomes harder to attain, men are left without a map of what other things they could be. Being a sole provider is hard when the economy isn't prospering, being the muscular strongman is hard when you work a white-collar job, and being stoic and not talking about our struggles, or feeling the need to have social circles for support, has been leading to men committing suicide at an alarming rate.

2020-05-27 06:21:09,"I'm a trans man who struggles with being ""masculine,"" any advice?","Ever since I realized I was trans, I wanted to act more ""manly"" both for myself and to be seen as a man by others. The problem is that most of what I know as typically ""masculine"" is really more akin to toxic masculinity, or behavior that leads to such. I don't know if I'm being too cautious but the last thing I want to do is offend anyone. I realize typing this out that the answer is probably ""do what makes you happy,"" but a lot of my interests are traditionally feminine, like makeup, sewing, drawing, and my general aesthetic. I don't know, gender dysphoria is a mysterious beast that doesn't quite make sense, but it tells me that I need more ""masculine"" interests or traits to balance out the feminine. You would think after nearly 5 years of transition I would figure this stuff out but it still bothers be a little. Any advice on what I can do to feel and/or appear more masculine?
I'm really glad this sub exists. Thanks guys.

EDIT: wow you guys are the best. Reading these comments I'm starting to realize that I already do some of these things, and I guess I just saw them as normal, rather than manly, which I guess is a good sign. I think I'll feel a whole lot better once quarantine is over and I can hang out with my guy friends again. I might try to use this time to get into what you guys are suggesting, like exercise, cosplay, and maybe ill ask my dad to help me start woodworking. I really like making things (I mean I'm an engineering major) so I'll be putting a lot of energy into that.

EDIT 2: I'm really glad that other guys experience. In the trans community, thinking your not ""trans enough"" is so common that its seen as a sign that you are, in fact, trans. So I guess questioning if I think I'm not manly enough, I am just manly enough... if that makes any sense.
A lot of you suggested finding a good role model, and without really knowing it I already had one: Dan Avidan. He's an internet personality (I know him from Game Grumps) and a musician. He's funny, kind, compassionate, talented, and overall the kind of person I want to be.
I think what this thread has taught me is that I'm already masculine, but I've sort of tricked myself into thinking that there's some magic set of traits that will convince everyone that I'm a man. I need to focus on who I am, what I like, and who I surround myself with, and improve myself from there.

I talked about my dysphoria for a bit with her and she said some things I wanted to share with you all, as I thought they were particularly insightful. Not just for people with gender dysphoria, but also for anyone that wants to be more masculine or feels they aren't masculine enough.

A lot of masculinity is based on the idea of being 'big', both literally and metaphorically. Literally big, as in being taller, having more muscle mass, etc. And metaphorically big, as in being more assertive, more confident, more upfront. Plus, for me especially, it means being vocally 'bigger', having a deeper and more 'masculine' voice.

This description of masculinity definitely resonated with me very well. It also explained a lot of my dysphoria, as I see myself as a literally and metaphorically 'small' person.

2020-05-25 23:10:41,"Men need to be taught more about good/normal things relating to women, not just how bad misogyny/sexism are. We need more of that to balance out what might be a narrow view otherwise, even to be better allies. In my case, story-based video games helped with this.","Getting this out of the way that my social skills have needed work since about forever. It's relevant to the post.

I understood misogyny and sexism from a young age, but I didn't really ""get"" girls/women. I was very uncomfortable around them and thought about them primarily in terms of social justice.

I wish I was exposed to more stories about girls/women that just showed more of what normal life is like for them. Not strictly limited to cautionary tales about sexism/misogyny. I mean that is relevant, and I wouldn't want to be less up on that, but it seems like I had no other concept in my mind about girls/women than ""sexism/misogyny is bad and be sure not to perpetuate that toward them, because that would be unfair and it would suck.""

That leaves no positive vibes left at all, and makes me kind of associate these horrible things with girls/women, ironically. (It also limited my view of what men could be, and harmed my relationship to masculinity in general, but more on that toward the end.)

I ended up being a not very pleasant guy to talk to, for girls/women because I would be on edge around them not know what to say.

Recently I've been playing video games with female characters and finding it refreshing to dig into a portrayal that has more going on in it than ""sexism/misogyny bad."" It almost always comes up, but there is MORE going on. And as you might expect, the fact that I have to input controls for the character to do anything, but their abilities or choices are limited to what makes sense for them in that moment, really puts me in their shoes, but also empowers this neural association between my agency as the player and the character that I am playing as.

I know this going to sound kind of dumb or corny, but I played as Leia in Star Wars Battlefront II and it was fininshing up a mission I had failed like five or six times without using the ""hero"" ability and just wrapping up this gruelling, symbolic victory with Leia was a real triumph. It reminds me that women and girls have more going on, more that they care about (politics, the symbolism of the rebellion vs the empire and all that, military strategy (she's a fucking general) and tactics in battle, all that.) But I _LIVED_ it too.

I played Life is Strange, which is this high school drama with characters and plot full of rich emotional lives and character development. There are several characters that do a good job of showing a rounded slice of life for people of different walks of life. The cool kids, the jocks the cheerleaders. Male or female, there's somebody of every stripe. But especially given the main character is female, the people she talks to also skew female, and there's a lot of thorough portrayals of female characters with vastly different life priorities, personalities and shit they're dealing with. And (mild spoilers but hardly) there's again a bit of ""saving the world"" vibe, which gives an ease of relating my sense of ""oh shit gotta save the world"" as a player, to what the character needs to do to solve it. Like, if I want to fix things, I have to do it through her shoes so to speak.

And I'm playing A Plague Tale: Innocence, which as you might imagine has to do with a plague. (thematic spoilers) Seeing society crumble, and feeling like you gotta do something about it would put me in the main character's shoes anyway. But the rich relationships between the characters has really struck a chord with me, and I have really felt for them all. I feel like I know them and we've bonded, because as you can imagine the characters in a plague are going through some shit together.

So basically what I'm liking is having these portrayals that are rich and not to do with just surface-level stuff or just stereotypical ""a minority/marginalized group IS their symbolically, cosmically unfair struggles, full stop end of story."" And I love to (just about literally) walk in somebody's shoes as a way to break down barriers.

I think it helped me with my social skills in general, because to problem solve in these games you need to understand the social relationships, you need to empathize, and so on. It helped me connect with the male characters, too and stop thinking about men in terms of being just ""misogynists/sexists,"" too. There are a lot of good MALE characters in these games as well. And plenty of ones who are reallistically balanced and have rich characterization. But that isn't what I'm focusing on most in this post.

To what extent do you find the idea of seduction to be manipulative or coercive?  Robert Greene's in his book on the laws of power is inherently predatory.  In previous times,  there were numerous strictures against the practice (often predicated upon the idea that a man who enticed a woman into sexual relations without intention of marrying her was making her unmarriageable, with restitution due to *her father*).  Various PUA techniques are derided as rape-y, when they're not explicit instructions in sexual harassment or assault.   And pressuring someone into sexual relations is...

I have seen so much empowerment come from it for those who are developing their careers. One of my mentors was a part of this group on her way up and has been good for me too.

&#x200B;

That being said an interesting question came up a few years ago. One of my former managers (who at one point lead up a similar differently focused engagement groups internally years ago) challenged me. I was about to lead one these groups in my area and he provide me quite a bit of  help. I asked him if he was still engaged and he told me no. He said there was no group that represented him and he felt a little estranged by it. 

Now I will tell you he is a white male and I am not. He was and still is the best manager I have ever had and really took a personal stake in my career growth (introduced me to my first mentor (mentioned above), gave me many contacts, provided me manager exclusive training, and many more actions like this). He did the same for one of my other managers a black female who confided in me that she was going nowhere until he came. She told me he mentored her and pushed for her to become a manager. She eventually took his old position and he had been grooming her for it. He consistently out scored other managers upon employee review and changed the culture where I was. 

&#x200B;

With this all being said I asked a simple question of the other leaders of the various groups one day, ""**Who handles men health awareness month i.e. Movember?"".** I was met with shrugs and slightly bewildered responses and, to be fair the general consensus was we should do something around this but it was a luke warm response when implemented.

&#x200B;

If you do have one do you know how it came about? If you don't who usually engages men like this manager on issues facing his subset? How do you keep it inclusive to women?

2020-05-21 22:43:21,A system that is sexist towards both men and women: The Turkish free healthcare system,"Hi, people of MensLib, I have a very interesting issue I'd like to share with you, a legal issue from my country that somehow manages to be both anti-male and also anti-female at the same time.

So, Turkey has a free healthcare system that works very oddly. Healthcare is completely free until the age of 25. After that point, you have to be employed in a legitimate job to continue receiving free healthcare (i.e. you have to be a taxpayer). If you are unemployed, you have to pay an insurance premium to the government to get ""free"" healthcare. The things I explained until here have some issues even on their own (e.g. how is an unemployed person gonna pay an insurance premium, and why 25, why not 18 or 30, and you can not opt-out from the state insurance, you have to either have this or private insurance), but the real problem starts here:

The requirement to pay this premium or being a taxpayer is ONLY FOR MEN. Women get free healthcare even if they are unemployed and broke. But I told you that this system was also anti-female, so here is that part: To keep having free healthcare after the age of 25, women have to be married to a taxpaying male, or their father has to be a taxpayer or a retired person. They can not get this from their mother even if she is a huge taxpayer, it *has to be* a male. So basically, this forces them to be dependent on a male. If they are unemployed, not married, and their father is dead, they have to go through *a lot of* paperwork and bureaucracy to keep getting free healthcare. But at least they have this option, men don't have even that. Men can continue getting totally free healthcare only if they are mentally or physically unfit for any work, are veterans,  are on unemployment salary (that you get only after you get fired from a company that you have been working for at least 3 years, and you don't get it if you left yourself or haven't been able to find any job in your life which is very likely with the countries sky-high unemployment rates like 21%), or are non-citizens that don't have a work permit like refugees (which is considered to be racism towards the countries own people by some). If you are interested, more details are in the comments.

**TL;DR:** We have a free healthcare system that says ""Your life is worth a lot less than the life of a woman"" to men, and ""Your life is worth something, only if you are dependent on a man"" to women, and says ""but you know whose life is worth the most? The ones that pay inhumanly high taxes to its government"" to both of them.",True,1452,0.98,81,,/r/MensLib/comments/gny3ra/a_system_that_is_sexist_towards_both_men_and/,napstrike
2020-05-22 13:11:00,What is the healthiest way to navigate sexual curiosity/interest in porn for teenagers? Is there such a thing?,"Okay, so I'm a dad who has kids who, in a number of years, will become teenagers. So far we've done the best we could with giving them a healthy attitude towards sex. We don't beat around the bush, we tell it like it is, and we answer questions as fully and appropriately as possible. And as this community would be well-aware, it's not just about the mechanics of sex, but the psychology, and sociology of it all. So far, so good; they seem to have very healthy and educated attitudes about sex.

But inevitably, it'll become more than just theory, biology kicks in, and they'll want to start exploring. I don't ascribe to the ""put surveillance software on their devices and block everything"" attitude, because there's nothing like good old-fashioned authoritarianism to make sexual puritanism even worse.

The standard progressive advice I've seen around the more liberal ends of the internet seem to be something like: ""have open and honest conversations about expectations and reality. Make sure that they understand that porn is unrealistic."" 

That all being said, the mainstream porn landscape is still a horrifying one. The ""open and honest conversation"" approach, while necessary, is about as useful as telling them that there is healthy and unhealthy food, and then sending them to a greasy food court to get lunch. 

So here comes the really odd question: are there 'good' porn websites that exist, with ethical labor practices, well-compensated workers, producing non-toxic pornographic content, and promoting healthy attitudes towards sex? I'd pay for this sort of content, if, for nothing else, to make it accessible to young adults who otherwise only have violent, misogynist, and exploitative alternatives. Ideally, this kind of content can also help present the mindsets that make it easier for young adults to discern between healthy and toxic content.

No one wants to think about their kid being into porn,  and I know there are people who believe there really isn't such a thing as 'good porn' and I'm sometimes inclined to agree. But I also think we should be realistic about the world we live in. I think that if teens are going to consume porn anyway, then we should deconstruct the toxic framework in which porn has traditionally been consumed. In the same way that mainstream porn has harmed us, well-produced porn could potentially shape healthy attitudes. 

So do these places exist? If they do, how do we support it? If not, what are we doing in the meantime? If you're a parent of a teen right now, how are you navigating all this?",True,80,0.9,28,,/r/MensLib/comments/god4nq/what_is_the_healthiest_way_to_navigate_sexual/,gotawkwardquestions
2020-05-22 01:30:59,How to reconcile energy for men's issues with feminism,"So, I've run into some hard feelings to process and I was hoping I could get some advice.

Recently, from reading around and also having discussions with my lady friends, I've gotten the message that feminist women often choose not to talk about or address men's issues based on a few common reasons. Often, they say it's not their job to fix men's problems for them. Some say that feminism isn't even for men and that men need to find their own movement. Still others are just immediately exhausted by men wanting to redirect the conversation.

I can understand their feelings and I think they have valid points, but now I'm conflicted. I feel that I'd be crucified if I chose not to be a feminist or support women's issues based on any of the above reasons. So why is it accepted and normal for women to actively not care about men's issues? It's been rubbing me the wrong way and turning me off putting any energy into supporting them.

Therefore, it seems likely that men probably suffer at a similar rate and are just less likely to be diagnosed.

2020-05-21 10:35:10,NFL Player Molested on Plane by Woman is Suing Airline,"I feel like this article ([https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/\_/id/29200201/in-lawsuit-nfl-player-says-was-sexually-harassed-assaulted-united-airlines-flight](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29200201/in-lawsuit-nfl-player-says-was-sexually-harassed-assaulted-united-airlines-flight)) has a lot that's worth discussing here.

Summary: A man is sitting next to a drunk woman on an airplane.  The woman is clearly intoxicated and is not respecting the boundaries of either of the men sitting next to her.  After over an hour of nasty behavior, the woman straight up grabs this man's junk, at which point he stands up on the plane and finally gets her removed from her seat.  United Airlines is refusing to give any information on the woman who committed the assault, the flight attendants who failed to respond to the repeated complaints, or any potential witness, so they're suing United.

I feel like this leads to some questions.  
A: If this were an extremely drunk man molesting two women, would the flight attendants still have ignored the situation prior to it turning into sexual assault?  Is there a different attitude towards men's complaints of sexual assault, especially when it's a man complaining about a woman?

B: If this were a man committing sex crimes, and men ignoring them, would United still be trying to hide the identity of the perpetrator and the people who failed to take these crimes seriously?  
C: Why should anyone, male or female, feel it necessary to hide their identity as sexual assault victims?  What kind of abuse are these men trying to avoid by making themselves anonymous?

I hope that the result of this lawsuit improves the ability of United and other corporations to take male sexual assault seriously.  Clearly much progress needs to be made.",True,1055,0.96,81,,/r/MensLib/comments/gnolca/nfl_player_molested_on_plane_by_woman_is_suing/,Othernamewentmissing

My dad... kinda sucks sometimes. A lot, actually. He's a great guy, with a good heart, and he cares a lot... but he's not a good parent. In fact, he's such a bad parent, it's given me a lot of hang-ups about the role of 'father' in general.

I want to change my relationship with the idea of 'dad' but it's really hard, cuz it seems like dads are kinda useless, and get off easy all the time re: parenting.

The reason I'm asking... recently someone I care about started calling me her 'dad,' because I have been helping her though the pandemic since she lost her job. I'm not a male person so it's especially confusing as to what she means. I know she means it lovingly, but it makes me CRINGE because all I can think of is my own dad, and how much he's fucked me up. I don't wanna say anything to her bc I know she means it in the nicest way. But every time she says it, I have a low-key existential crisis for the rest of the day.

2020-05-20 00:20:50,How can we get society to acknowledge and accept that men have breaking points too?,"This post is inspired by a series of posts I've seen on a certain sub where people go to ask if they're the asshole in a certain situation. Over the last year, I've seen at least three variations of the following post:

""My wife is pregnant and about to give birth. She insists that I should be with her in the delivery room, but I feel deeply nauseous at the sight of blood and I could faint. I would rather not be in the delivery room if I can't stand it. Am I the Asshole?""

And the response is, overall, that yes he is. The overall argument is that the wife is going through a harder experience and her need for comfort trumps the man's hardship. I've seen top comments including sentences like ""pull up your big boy pants"", ""suck it up buttercup"" and, of course, ""man up"". 

To be honest, it conflicts me to see that. I can understand the argument about the needs of the wives, but on the other hand I feel that these arguments are putting on the husband a pressure that he may be unable to handle and still expect him to bear it. 

I think overall this is part of the social expectations that are harmful for men: expecting us not to have any breaking points, or to continue even past them. The above situation is just the particular example that motivated my post, but there are a lot more situations where that expectation is in play. 

So, how it would be possible to get society to acknowledge, and even more importantly, accept, that men have breaking points and that it's okay and should be respected?",True,196,0.96,20,,/r/MensLib/comments/gmrqp3/how_can_we_get_society_to_acknowledge_and_accept/,MarsNirgal

Thankfully we're talking much more about men's mental health these days so hopefully this technique can help a few of you through these weird times.

TLDR;

* The technique was popularised by Tara Brach
* When uncomfortable emotions arise go through these 4-steps
* R – Recognise. Recognise the emotion, labelling it can help.
* A – Allow. Allow yourself to feel it fully. Don't resist.
* I – Investigate. Stay curious about the emotion. Ask it questions. What are the physical sensations in the body. What is it trying to tell you.
* N – Non-identification. Realisation that we are not our emotions.

Obviously not a panacea, and easier said than done but another technique to add to your toolkit.

2020-05-11 23:46:32,Emotional maturity and relationships,"Every Mother's Day, I see tweets along the lines of ""Happy Mother's Day to straight guys' girlfriends;"" the point of these tweets is to remark on how men, at least a lot of young men, have the wrong approach to their relationships in terms of taking care of themselves. And I read another tweet explaining that it boils down to emotional immaturity. For various reasons, men don't have super good emotional regulation skills and so they expect their partners to fix their emotions for them. (And, yes, not ALL men do this, but just enough to make a problem out of this; and even if you think it doesn't apply to you, you might still pick up something). 

This ties into an article I read in Harper's Bazaar about men being ""emotional gold diggers,"" i.e., men using partners as free therapists even though 1) partners aren't trained to be therapists and 2) partners aren't meant to be therapists in the first place. 

How can we stop men from doing this to partners? How can we be more emotionally mature and responsible?  And at the same time, I realize that there's a really fine balance we will have to make because there are more and more messages that men need to open up and be vulnerable, but how do we ensure that doesn't ruin our relationships? 

I'm not going to lie, I'm pretty terrified about my own levels of emotional maturity and responsibility. So that's why I'm posting this now to see if anyone has suggestions on how to ensure that relationships aren't about men getting their emotions fixed for free by their partners.",True,55,0.83,48,,/r/MensLib/comments/ghq0qr/emotional_maturity_and_relationships/,CuriousParadoxIs
2020-05-11 14:24:04,Nuances surrounding trans men in activism,"Cross posted to r/ftm
I've been out to myself, teachers, and close friends as a trans man for less than a year. I do not pass and I get clocked as a queer female in most regards. But... I feel invisible not because of who I am, but how our identity tends to be treated. The second I started identifying as a male and made my side Facebook profile, I started internalizing the ""men are awful"" ""men are trash"" rhetoric in another way. I dont want to be awful or trash. I don't want to be something that people hate. But whenever I try to mention how the ""men are bad"" mentality is harmful to people who are trying to become comfortable with their own masculinity, I instantly get told I'm an oppressive male who needs to recognize I'm privileged. 
But I'm not.
I'm just a ""queer woman"" riddled with gender dysphoria. 
And so I just feel like we go from being victims of the patriarchy while being socialized as females, to being told to shut up by our own community for being men, and we aren't granted the space to see our masculinity as a good thing.
I'm a feminist, but I think we need to work on how we criticize the patriarchy and toxic masculinity in a way that INCLUDES the nuances surrounding trans men and let us grow up to be healthy, well adjusted, compassionate, trans men, because we were given the space to do so.",True,136,0.96,112,,/r/MensLib/comments/ghi8od/nuances_surrounding_trans_men_in_activism/,andylyleryan

2020-05-08 22:04:36,Can there be a discussion on “simping” and the men that it is directed towards?,"If you hang around the internet long enough, and *especially* if you hang around the more misogynistic regions of the internet, you’ll come across this term soon enough.

Plainly put, calling someone a “simp” or “simping” is, in my mind, the today’s internet lingo version of “nice guy” or “white knighting” for the most part. It stands for....ugh, “Sucker Idolizing Mediocre Pussy”.

I don’t think I need to point out why this is problematic for multiple reasons, but I will anyways.

This whole term comes with a host of baggage, such as reducing men down to just sex-crazed losers. And reduces women down to just their body parts. And it really, really invalidates a man if he wants to, say, go out to lunch with a female friend, or do something nice for her. Nope, all he wants to do is get in her pants and he’s a loser for going about it that way. And she ain’t even that great anyways.

It’s just a term used to lord over people and make oneself feel better at the expense of another. This is often used as well towards men who, essentially, pay for sexual content online or donate money towards Internet personalities (who are usually women).

But instead of there being a discussion about why men do these things, or instead of letting men just *have female friends*, men are shamed and ridiculed and subjected to a whole host of toxic attitudes, both online and in real life.

Perhaps instead of shaming men, we talk to them, help them, and make sure that they’re doing well. And if they then want to donate their cash to Internet personalities, I sure as hell ain’t gonna care.

I wish I could go more into depth but really more than anything I despise modern internet jargon for being so toxic towards men and women, and simultaneously at that!

Could that possibly be liberating for people who currently identify as men? It seems like a lot of the harm to men, as men, comes fundamentally from the fact that they are put into these boxes from birth and then socialised to act a certain way, with unnecessary pressures and responsibilities that can be toxic to them.

More broadly, is a more queer understanding of masculinity a good tool for helping men self-actualise?

This is something I've never been conscious of, myself, with the sole exception of the classic example of walking behind a woman on a quiet street, especially at night. I don't think of myself as an intimidating person (I've never been in a fight in my life, but nor have I ever had to do anything to avoid one).

Now, it's quite possible that I am intimidating people without realizing it, I suppose. I can be a bit oblivious. And if I'm walking around town, I'm either thinking about my shopping list, or designing a transport system for a fictional town that lives in my head, or puzzling over a programming/webdev issue, or suchlike, not so much observing how people are reacting to me.

Is this something I should start to care about? It would never have occurred to me as an issue if I hadn't been reading here.

2020-05-07 02:29:06,Why we need to talk about male homemakers,"So recently I watched an indian movie called ki and ka which dealth with the situation of men who wanted to be homemakers. Obviously in Indian society this is quite unique. So I begun thinking about it.

Firstly let me just that I personally dont mind anyone of any gender wanting to be a homemaker, but I have my reservations about whether or not someone SHOULD be a homemaker. Imagine this scenario, you are a young person who wants to be a homemaker, you get married to someone you love and have children with them. But then your spouse starts abusing you. You dont want to be with them anymore but you are too scared to leave because of what will happen to your children. You fear homelessness, or you fear your children getting taken away from you. Now imagine this person is male.

Without first ensuring social safety nets and a more open approach to domestic violence victims, I dont think we should encourage men to be home makers. My own mother was a homemaker, my father abused her, my sister, and I. Several women in my family became homemakers, and they also faced abuse.

The rates of domestic violence, not just by men but by women is extraordinary. And that risk only increases when one of the people is a home maker. Its quite common in some areas to stay with an abusive spouse due to financial reasons. It obviously depends on where you live but in East Africa it happens alot.

So in short, there needs to be more protections in place for homemakers before we start encouraging men to be homemakers.",True,88,0.91,44,,/r/MensLib/comments/gepk8l/why_we_need_to_talk_about_male_homemakers/,JackieNaper1907

2020-05-06 08:56:07,Is Eco-Friendly Unmanly?,"I came across [this paper](http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2e55/1cfd1feff22213f49e132383b05b680cc0cc.pdf) today and read it in fascination. I'd noticed before that yeah, men were less likely to live a more environmentally-friendly lifestyle or to actively identify as environmentalists. But this was the first time I'd come across an academic study that aimed to demonstrate that *and* explain why.

Basically, the authors of the paper conducted 6 studies, which in total supported their hypothesis that **because being green is strongly associated with femininity, men resist adopting eco-friendly attitudes, choices, behaviors, or identities.** 

Some highlights from the paper:

* There are *several possible reasons* for the green-feminine stereotype:
   * Many eco-friendly messages use font styles/colors that are perceived as feminine.
   * Green marketing efforts tend to target 'feminine industries' like cleaning, cooking, family health, laundry, etc.
   * Environmentalism and conservationism reflect caring and nurturing of the environment, which are feminine traits.
   * To the extent that women are actually more green than men, this could just be a reflection of what comes to mind when thinking of the typical environmentalist.
* A strong internalized association between greenness and femininity affects *perceptions of the self*. Meaning, men and women who engage in green behaviors and who hold green attitudes would perceive of themselves as more feminine.
* Study 1 demonstrated the existence of an implicit association between greenness and femininity.
* Study 2 demonstrated that the greenness-femininity association is prevalent among both men and women, and that people engaging in eco-friendly behaviors were perceived as more feminine.
* Study 3 demonstrated that recalling green (vs. nongreen) behavior led to a higher self-perception of femininity among both men and women. 
* Study 4, 5, and 6 demonstrated that following a threat to their masculine gender identity, men were less likely to choose green products. On the other hand, an affirmation of masculinity made men more likely to choose green products, to a similar degree as women.

2020-05-04 23:17:29,Dr. Michael Flood on Engaging Men and Boys in Violence Prevention,"Michael Flood has released a new e-book (for free) on male violence:  [https://xyonline.net/content/new-book-engaging-men-and-boys-violence-prevention](https://xyonline.net/content/new-book-engaging-men-and-boys-violence-prevention)   


The book offers information on policy and interventions to help tackle the interpersonal violence that men typically inflict on women. The book aims to offer gender-conscious ways to reduce the influence of aggression and violence in men's lives, and how constructions of masculinity shape men's use of violence and acceptance of violence as a form of gendered power. The book also details on mobilising men to reshape the cultures that encourage and enable male dominance and violence, offering various ways to change the dynamics through individual, institutional and educational reform. It also discusses some of the difficulties in engaging men and boys in changing gender scripts and some of the anti-feminist arguments made in challenge of these ideas.",True,51,0.8,2,,/r/MensLib/comments/gddfrx/dr_michael_flood_on_engaging_men_and_boys_in/,DryingOutEarthworm
2020-05-04 03:17:18,How to end expectations of praise?,"Hi, all, this is my first post here. I guess I want to ask you all about what men can do to to stop expecting praise for being pro-feminist or being ""better than bad men."" I recently read a quote from actress Maisie Williams who said that we should think of people as ""regular people"" or ""sexists"" (rather than ""feminists"" vs ""not feminists,"" which seems to give a pass to ""not feminists""). Reminding myself of that quote has helped me. We shouldn't get any praise just for doing the basics of what a regular, non-sexist person would do. The problem, of course, is that everyone likes to be complimented/praised every now and then, but it really has gotten ridiculous. As an analogy, should I expect praise from drivers for wearing my seatbelt, even if some drivers don't? Of course not because everyone should wear seatbelts. Just because some people don't doesn't mean the ones who do are particularly deserving of praise. 
It's probably not going to be an easy thing to accept, but it's for the best. I think a lot of feminists are understandably tired that expectations for male behavior are so low (in regards to treating women).

Edit: Thank you for all the responses! I do I want to add that maybe another strategy would be practicing self-acceptance. Let's go beyond the good/bad binary and let's maybe not make global moral evaluations of ourselves based on singular actions. If we can think of ourselves as enough/acceptable as humans no matter what, maybe we won't feel like we need praise from others. Maybe we can then act knowing it's the right thing to do, rather than, as a commenter remarked, it's the the ego-boosting thing to do.

Edit 2: This morning on Twitter I saw a debate over a related topic. It concerned a man who did NOT have a fit, demand an explanation, or otherwise display male entitlement when a woman didn't want to give him her phone number. In the replies to the tweet, it seemed like about half of ppl were saying that ""why should we be praising men for doing the basic minimum?"" While another half tweeted that, as people in the comments to this post have mentioned, positive reinforcement could help change male behavior. Personally, I'm not sure if I'm a fan of the latter belief. Would it lead male behavior to change for the wrong reasons?",True,582,0.94,214,,/r/MensLib/comments/gcwdx4/how_to_end_expectations_of_praise/,CuriousParadoxIs
2020-05-03 13:31:58,"How do you appropriately respond to your ""unmanly"" speech being mocked?","tl;dr at bottom if you don't want to read really long post.

I grew up in a household full of girls and women.  Four older sisters, mom and grandma.  No father present.  I didn't really have a regular male role model after I was 10.  My great grandfather died, amazing and wonderful man.  Anyway, I grew up in the South. My mom and grandma both very strong but also incredibly nurturing and loving to me, and everyone really.  I picked up phrases that left me feeling cared about, like my grandma would say when I was sick, ""Bless your heart, Nana's got just the thing to make you feel better.""  ""Bless your heart"" always sounded to me like a sincere way to recognize a child is sick.  And it just gave me the feels as a child.  Not to mention that the thing that was going to make me feel better was a concoction of hot lemons honey and *whiskey*.  I'm showing my age here

So today I was talking to a guy I work with, he mentioned his son was really sick, but it's not covid 19 thankfully.  And I said, ""Well bless his heart, I hope he feels better."" And he mockingly repeats what I said in a squeaky ""feminine squeal"".  I said, ""excuse me, did I say something offensive?"" He said, "" Nah man,  you just sounded like you were channeling a woman there.""  Another time a male friend gave me a thoughtful gift and I said, ""Aw this warms my heart, I'll cherish it."" And he replied, ""Woah, calm down there girly, it's not a promise ring."".  I played it off with ""haha this isn't a proposal?""

The ""Bless his heart"" reaction did annoy me and I sounded annoyed.  I really regret that.  The second one ""I'll cherish this"" really hurt my feelings and the nice gift he gave me, lost a lot of meaning to me.  I really want to not only respond better towards those comments, I also want to react internally better.  I want men to know I appreciate them when they do something nice for me.  I also want to express care about their hardships like a sick son, but I'm conflicted on how I should do that.  Should I stay authentic and just respond more appropriately directly to them and internally?  Or should I change my speech to something more ""manly"" so they are more receptive?  I want to have nice moments with men.  We all need that.  But I want them to be *nice* moments not hurtful ones that stay with me and leave a bad taste in my mouth, or theirs.

tl;dr 
When you feel like your speech is being mocked by others for being ""unmanly"" or too ""feminine"" in a situation where you're expressing concern or gratitude towards another man, how do you respond appropriately, and by appropriately I mean, in a way that doesn't make the situation more awkward by being outwardly or obviously offended? 

**Update: Just the few responses I received, made me feel a lot better about the situations I've spoken of and how I express gratitude and concern.  I've decided to be authentic and prioritize the people in my life that appreciate who I am and don't mock me.  So, thank you to those that responded.**",True,975,0.98,120,,/r/MensLib/comments/gclbcy/how_do_you_appropriately_respond_to_your_unmanly/,toddschmod

2020-05-01 05:46:48,"I'd like to recommend a book, I think it'd be meaningful to people in this Subreddit","For those who haven't read it, ""How Not To Be a Boy"" is Robert Webb's autobiography. Webb's most well known for playing Jez in Peep Show, and his sketch show with David Mitchell.

He's also a very intelligent, thoughtful and compassionate person who uses his autobiography to reflect on what it means to be a man in modern society, and the failings of society to prepare men for emotional maturity and health.

Here's a little quote from him which sums up some of his views.

""The work of love, the work of companionship, the work of understanding, the work of humility and gentleness. These are skills that, in so many cases, we still teach boys to despise. We tell the gentle ones to get tough and the tough ones to get tougher.

We do it in the absurd belief that we are preparing them for a difficult life. In fact, we hobble them. We leave them unprepared for adversity and almost entirely unprepared for love. They are our children. They deserve better.""

It's a wonderful book, it's thoughtfully written and includes some very personal stories such as Webb coming to terms with being bisexual, only for his male crush and his female crush to start going out with each other. He discusses the painful loss of his mother, the challenges of attending Cambridge University whilst not coming from a wealthy background, and much more.  

It's something I'd recommend to any man, and I think women would appreciate it too.",True,67,0.92,8,,/r/MensLib/comments/gb51h6/id_like_to_recommend_a_book_i_think_itd_be/,fade_like_a_sigh

The male main character stands up to his crush to say that she hasn't been listening and has been dismissive of the ideas and feelings of the people around her, including him. And it's a problem.

She takes it seriously and so does the film. There's no jabs at a guy being emotional vulnerable. The movie doesn't stop to give him a patronizing round of applause either. 

But he meets men in power who are compassionate AND masculine, after feeling like an outcast after being raised around only woman and feminine men.

So yeah, if you've got kids, or like something that's a little feel-good movie this is a good one. The actual main plot is smarter than it should be.

I wanted to introduce you to The Bravery. [www.thebravery.org](https://www.thebravery.org) (full website being redesigned) We've been quietly doing workshops with teen boys around the country for a couple of years, focused on working with them around what we call Emotional Bravery. My co-founder and I met in an Evryman group several years ago. Our professional lives and personal backgrounds both are deep in education and the arts, and so wanted to create something that drew on those backgrounds for younger guys.  

We've been working with schools and youth groups doing in-person activities and groups, and with social distancing, we decided to launch a digital program for teens. It is an 8-session  digital course with facilitated virtual groups that strengthen emotional bravery among young men and teenage boys in junior and high school.  We're really excited about it, and I wanted to get your feedback, insight, and invite any of you who might be interested in helping to do so.

We'd love any feedback or insight, especially from folks who are working in schools or work with young men and boys.  I'm gonna share some links, and then some questions/requests. 

There is a video about the in-person workshops here: [https://www.instagram.com/p/B-u8cikjCwM/](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-u8cikjCwM/)

2020-04-26 11:22:03,Quick moderation note about personally messaging the mods of MensLib,"Hello, /r/MensLib!

Every so often one of our members takes the time to send a personal message to one or more of our mod team. By and large these messages are positive, or simply a followup discussion on a particular moderator decision. However, our team has been getting an influx lately of harassing or abusive PMs, so I've issued guidance to the team on how to handle these, and I wanted to keep you all in the loop.

1. For the most part, any questions, comments, or complaints about how we moderate this space should be served through [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FMensLib). This is by far the quickest way to deal with these issues, as one or more of us is usually around to keep up on our modmail inbox.

2. There will be an absolute zero-tolerance policy for any user sending abusive or harassing PMs; you will be banned, and reported to the admins if that doesn't do the trick. Furthermore, if your PM fits the description of point #1, our mods have been given full discretion to ban you temporarily or permanently depending on what they personally consider to be the appropriate response. Neither I nor any other higher-ranked mod will be hearing appeals on these decisions.

I hope everyone is having a fine evening and we can move past this problem.

2020-04-25 15:45:58,I had to report a man for sexual harassment and it was terrifying,"So maybe I'm being a bit dramatic here. I play dungeons and dragons a lot. I'm currently on reduced hours at work and running games 4 to 5 days a week in a decent sized community. We have a few women players, but by no means a lot. Some of our group used to meet in person regularly, but we have suspended IRL games and joined a wider discord community. 

In a game I was running a male player decided it would be funny to slap a female player's character on the butt in order to cast a buff on her. Let's just say it didn't go well. The offender is someone I knew pretty well. We've sat across a table from each other many times and shared many laughs and jokes. The game concluded pretty awkwardly, but I felt it was necessary to try and talk with the guy. I explained how it was inappropriate and I tried to appeal to the decent person inside of him by adding that he's a good person deep down who was out of line at that moment. His response was less than stellar. He argued it was just a game and that if the woman who was harassed (he put harassed in quotes) really cared she would have said something instead of me saying something. It was then that I realized that if I didn't say something this would probably never be addressed. So I decided to report him to the admin group on the server.

In that moment, I didn't know what would happen next. Would they believe me? What if they didn't care? What if they decided I was the problem for causing drama? I posted the conversation I had with him along with the general story. I watched agonizingly as people began reading it. In five minutes I had a response. It was, ""We have a zero tolerance policy here. I'll let him know he's banned from all future games here and in person. Sorry you had to deal with this. I will also apologize to the affected players and reaffirm our policy to everyone.""

I certainly don't think my experience is equal to those who are victims of harassment, but just reporting someone was nerve-racking. It's important that observers in the middle speak out when we see bad things. Even now I'm still a bit worried that this guy might show up when we meet in person again, or do something to hurt me or the girl, but I think if men and women are ever going to truly be equal we need to correct other men and if needed report them to protect others. Sorry for the rant and stuff, but it's important for us to police or community and use our places of power and privilege to push for equality. Even if it's scary, even if it doesn't affect you directly, even if it could end badly for you. You might be surprised at how many other people want to do the right thing.

2020-04-25 01:17:15,Rewarding Vulnerability,"Bit of a newcomer, this is my first post. Hi.

I have been thinking a lot about the value of this sub and of myself. Bit of a journey. Right now, I am reflecting on how I punish and reward myself-- and how I am punished and rewarded by others.

To be a little more detailed, I am using an exercise I learned from a therapist, which has you pretend to speak to your younger self, in depth, and discover what it was that child needed at that time. I needed to be vulnerable. I needed to be vulnerable with no guarantee of reciprocity or appreciation.

I concluded that platitudes work, but only as a reward. Saying ""I love you"" or ""I care about you"" resonates with people, but only after they say it first. That person is forced to trust you, is forced to have faith that their vulnerability will not be taken advantage of. The value of saying ""I love you"" is not in the words, its in the timing.

I have a lot of disagreements with Australian foreign policy, the use of war and the propaganda of young men to kill and be killed for exaggerated reasons. I have always been happy to remember fallen soldiers and pay my respects to them, but I feel uncomfortable engaging in a celebration that strengthens a harmful version of nationalism, pro-war and the status quo.

2020-04-22 20:40:59,It's really unfair and unfortunate that male femininity is so...despised,"...Isn't it? While ""Male femininity"" isn't the best way to phrase it, men and boys who do things that are associated with traditional ideas of femininity (which I'm going to call ""femininity"" in quotes for the sake of brevity) often receive a lot of shit for it. What is the best way to fight the idea that ""femininity"" is not for men or effeminacy is undesirable in men? How do we challenge those who enforce gender conformity in boys and men?

I was born a boy with a pretty high affinity for ""femininity"". I grew up repressing it hard after being sexually assaulted for being perceived as gay, when I was too young to understand such things. I ended up not developing a sexuality in my adolescence because I repressed my nature and stayed in denial, calling myself asexual because I couldn't bring myself to lie and say I was straight when I wasn't. I eventually came out as trans^**1** and began transitioning medically^**1**. Not too much longer, I fell in love with a wonderful man. It seemed like I was done with my battle for once. But it was not over.

I'm stuck at home because of the quarantine and I spent a lot of time on gender critical spaces during this time and I broke into a depression again, like all those years ago, because I felt disgusting. I felt ashamed and I felt like I was a pervert for wanting to be ""feminine"". I felt like a deceptive fraud for having a straight man as my partner if I'm not a woman and only a caricature of one. I felt like I was the problem, that my desire to be ""feminine"" is part of why women are oppressed.

I'm over it though. If it was okay for me to be myself growing up, if it were okay for me to sexually develop and explore like all of my peers, maybe I'd have been more comfortable in my own skin. But I didn't, because I felt terrified at the thought of being a ""feminine"" man. And that's the point - ""feminine"" men have it really fucking hard in this world. It's considered paraphilic, fetishistic, misogynistic just for expressing a little bit of ""femininity"". It's fucking bullshit.

I'm a strong believer in feminism because I believe that diversity is great. Being ""feminine"" is powerful, authentic, and it's part of life. And I think it can be for anyone.

Since I studied Sociology in High School, I've been aware that White Working Class Boys are much more likely to underperform.

2020-04-19 05:38:50,Do any of you have issues finding healthy spaces in gaming or nerd culture?,"I was thinking about how exhausting it is to be a woman in nerd and gaming culture, and was wondering if any of you more progressive guys have issues with it as well. For me, it’s really hard to enjoy it with the casual racism, sexism, homophobia, etc. The other day, I was playing CoD and heard some dude get so mad that he lost that he started throwing the n-word around and saying “black lives matter. To who? Not me.” 

And I’m still kicking myself for not saying anything, despite it really pissing me off just hearing someone talk to another human that way, but I also didn’t want to step on any toes and speak for someone. 

Have you guys found any way to deal with this? Or do you typically ignore it? I tried to get into some woman-based gaming groups, and while it was mildly better, and far less sexism and racism, I still found a lot of throwing around ableist and homophobic language, so I ended up leaving. Do you think there is a reason these cultures and groups tend to be more toxic than others you may find? I do notice it varies how much you’ll find from game to game, as well. Anyway, I just kinda wanted to talk about the issues in gaming (and nerd) culture with you guys, as I definitely see it as the more toxic cultures out there, despite the root things joining them together not necessarily being toxic in and of themselves.",True,555,0.96,240,,/r/MensLib/comments/g3vltg/do_any_of_you_have_issues_finding_healthy_spaces/,mymiddlenameisrae

The far right split men into groups, most alphas and betas. This is based on research of wolves in captivity, which has actually redacted. In reality, the alpha wolves are just the fathers. 

Alot of the pickup artist community are also far right (like Roosh V and his disgusting website) and they regularly shame men who do things that are even considered remotely feminine e.g playing a certain videogame, ordering a coffee, or even smiling.

2020-04-18 11:22:25,The Power of Tears,"So, like many of us, the global pandemic has been a huge source of stress for me over the last few weeks. I'm a police officer, so I'm fortunate enough to still be getting paid during this time when so many are struggling with unemployment, but a significant portion of my income comes from working security details at business and events, all of which have been cancelled, so there's still some financial pressure. (Edit: the stimulus check was a much appreciated relief in that regard.) But the main stressor has been the threat of the virus itself. My wife is diabetic and I have two very young children, so, while I'd likely be relatively fine if I contracted the virus, they're all at much higher risk. This frankly terrifies me in ways I've never experienced before. I've had close calls before, but if I'd ever been, for instance, stabbed in the past, it couldn't result in my loved ones bleeding to death. 

All of that anxiety had led to me becoming depressed and withdrawn. My wife noticed and I tried to discuss it with her, but I know she's afraid too and I'm trying not to reinforce that by letting her know just how anxious I am. I know that's not the healthiest approach, but I'm finding it very hard to communicate my fears without feeding into hers. 

So, basically, I've been struggling with all of this and have been overly sensitive about other things basically been on the verge of tears for several days. Today, something insanely trivial was the straw that broke the camel's back and I finally cried. It felt amazing. It allowed me the perspective to recognize that my fears, while very legitimate concerns, don't have to dominate my mood and send me into a spiral. 

Ideally, I would have gone to a therapist in order to have a safe space to talk through things before it got to that point, but that's not an option for me right now. So that being said, I just wanted to remind everyone how healthy it is to allow yourself to experience the totality of your emotions and let yourself cry. It's not a cure by any means, but it can be a tremendous relief, if only for a time. 

Also, if anyone is struggling, feel free to voice your feelings here. We need to be here for each other now more than ever",True,548,0.94,55,,/r/MensLib/comments/g3gmy5/the_power_of_tears/,Wolfhound1142

2020-04-16 00:11:39,Depictions of positive male sexuality.,"Does anyone know of any works that show positive and assertive hetero male sexuality? When we talk about positive masculinity and sex, the conversation always seems to revolve around a sort of repression of male sexuality. We focus on the need for men to form platonic friendships with women without sex being an ulterior motive, for men to be better able to handle rejection, for men not to be pushy with their sexual wants. All of these things are good and necessary, but I feel it pushes a sort of sexual passivity that doesn't work too well in the actual world of dating and sex. Men are expected to be the pursuers, and there is a certain amount of sexual assertiveness necessary to play that role. Indeed, the men I've known to be most successful with women were highly assertive with their sexual desire, and often jaw-droppingly blunt about what they wanted. They were also exemplars of toxic male sexuality, which I want no parts of. So I am looking for depictions of men who can be sexually assertive and direct with their intentions without also being toxic or harass-y.",True,272,0.97,170,,/r/MensLib/comments/g1uz9i/depictions_of_positive_male_sexuality/,nishagunazad

2020-04-13 23:11:30,Existing in men’s and women’s spaces as a trans man,"I’m trying to find my way around men’s spaces as a transgender man, I’m pre-almost everything but a hair cut and some voice training, which makes it kind of awkward, especially since I don’t know how to act like a “real man” because the ideal of manhood that cracked my egg in the first place was representation of queer men. So I don’t know how to act as a “real man” because societally speaking the men I look up to are untraditional. And when you’re trans even though that inherently means I’m not traditional, trans people are often expected to exist in conformity with their preferred gender.
Meanwhile in women’s spaces, I feel more comfortable because I know how to act, I’m also uncomfortable because I’m not a woman, not anymore at least. Women’s spaces are more ready to accept me as trans though, and aren’t weird about in a way men are about it. And most of my friends are women, and exist in feminist and women centric spaces. But I get dysphoric there, especially when they include me because I can relate, because I feel like they’re saying I’m not really a man because I know what it’s like to be a woman. 
Sometimes I give up and go and find an online trans space, but I am disappointed because most trans spaces, online or other wise are majority trans feminine focused. And online trans masc spaces are few and far between.
I don’t think it’s a bad thing that women have spaces for discussion, honestly it’s turned into more of a vent than anything else but if any guys have advice I’ll take it, or I there’s any good link to trans masculine places I can talk to that would be nice.",True,93,0.94,48,,/r/MensLib/comments/g0ks7t/existing_in_mens_and_womens_spaces_as_a_trans_man/,Fangirlhasnoreality

2020-04-07 21:46:18,Mental health and coronavirus,"Like many, many others, I've found the last few weeks a bit of an emotional rollercoaster. Things have started to settle now, but I still have some rocky days. Most of my intrusive thoughts and worries circle around health, so this whole situation has been particularly difficult to deal with. When you couple that with reduced contact with friends and family, it's unsurprising that it's been a difficult few weeks. And I count myself lucky as someone who isn't in a risk group and hasn't had to make too many changes to accommodate for the lockdown. 

There are various ways in which mental illness affects men in particular. I personally have noticed it's been difficult to reach out to people I'm close to and have an honest conversation about how I am feeling during the lockdown and pandemic more broadly. But there are also so many new and difficult emotions being brought up by this whole situation for everyone. Not only are there thoughts and emotions directly related to the pandemic, but also second-order thoughts and emotions as well. Adjusting to new working conditions, not being able to see friends as often, and so on. 

I thought it'd be a good idea to get a discussion going about what we can do to maintain good mental health during this period, as well as share our experiences and any helpful resources we've come across. I'll start things off with a few myself. 

1. I found the [NHS's guide on managing coronavirus related anxiety](https://www.nhs.uk/oneyou/every-mind-matters/coronavirus-covid-19-anxiety-tips/) particularly helpful. 
2. Cut yourself as much slack as you possibly can at the moment. I've had days where I just haven't been able to focus on work at all, and haven't felt like keeping on top of things like replying to friends' messages. Right now the main thing is to be kind to yourself. 
3. I've used this time to rediscover some things that I love. Reading for leisure and playing guitar are two of the main things I've gone back to now I've got a bit of extra time on my hands. 
4. Don't be afraid to reach out to people. I started this whole thing off concerned that I wouldn't have enough people to video call or phone, but I decided to get in touch with some people I haven't spoke to for a while and in some cases don't know all that well. I kept worrying that maybe I didn't know X well enough to ask if they fancied phoning, or Y might think it's strange I'm getting in touch after so long. But so far it's paid off. However, it's also important to be aware that other people are also going through real difficulties at the moment. 

Everyone's experience of this is going to be different, and I'm aware that some of the advice I've given above comes from a privileged position. But hopefully by sharing our various experiences we can all learn how to be a bit more resilient during this time.",True,285,0.97,43,,/r/MensLib/comments/fwkrt3/mental_health_and_coronavirus/,Mr_Fl0wers

2020-04-06 04:55:11,"""At most, 7% of men would talk to their father first, if they were feeling sad""","This is from a study made in 2017.  
Heilman, B., Barker, G., and Harrison, A. (2017). The Man Box: A Study on Being a Young
Man in the US, UK, and Mexico. Washington, DC and London: Promundo-US and Unilever.  
They asked around 1000 men from these three countries,from 18-30 years old questions about the Man Box. It's free to read and 68 pages long. I'll only be including some numbers and conclusions:

The aspect of my physical appearance I would most like to change is weight or body shape:  

|US|UK|Mexico|
|:-----------:|:------------:|:------------:|
| 48%|44%|51%|  
___  
Some of the conclusions:  
 
*Results show that young men are learning how to embrace emotional vulnerability,
but that they most often grapple with emotions on their own or with the support
of women in their lives. Young men, by and large, do not seek emotional support
from their fathers. Fear of appearing vulnerable or gay still has a powerful influence
over young men’s behaviors.  
___  
*Too many young men associate being a “real man” with binge drinking and
dangerous driving, putting themselves and others at risk when they try to measure
up to this harmful standard.  
___  
*Young men’s sense of physical attractiveness, while relatively high, is still primarily
associated with muscle bulk and body shape, as opposed to a more inward,
individual sense of confidence and attractiveness.  
___  
*Young men’s relationships with the ideals of manhood are complex and confusing,
and the process of breaking out of the Man Box is neither perfectly linear nor
straightforward. The study reveals some contradictory trends. Young men in the Man
Box are more satisfied with their lives, even as they display more symptoms of depression,
for instance. Men in the Man Box adhere to the most rigid gender norms, yet also feel
freer to transgress certain norms, such as crying in front of male friends or spending time
on indulgent grooming. These are real contradictions. We believe, however, that they are
accurate and logical representations of the dilemmas young men face in navigating society’s
contradictory ideals of manhood. Young men reap certain benefits from staying inside the
Man Box: it provides them with a sense of belonging, of living up to what is expected of
them. Friends and parents may praise them. However, when those same norms tell men to
be aggressive all the time, to repress emotions, and to fight every time someone threatens
them, the Man Box demands that they pretend to be someone they are not, and the resulting
life can be violent and lonely.  
___  
*Breaking out of the box is not something that young men can do on their own. Indeed,
if conforming to the rigid norms of the Man Box were obviously disadvantageous to men,
few men would do so. The picture is more complicated, and navigating the rewards and
punishments of manhood is a real dilemma in many settings. In this reality, all of us – young
men and young women, parents, educators, the media, teachers, romantic partners, and all
members of society – have a role to play in reinforcing positive, equitable, unrestrictive ideas of manhood.",True,1328,0.99,79,,/r/MensLib/comments/fvl6ze/at_most_7_of_men_would_talk_to_their_father_first/,

2020-04-04 22:56:57,Reluctance to talk about bisexual preferences,"Reluctance to talk about bisexual preferences

I've just recently found this sub, and was delighted to see it is not the reactionary anti-feminist den that I have come to expect from groups of men talking about masculinity online. There is something I have been thinking about, and this community seems ideal to discuss it with. It boils down to the question of why I find it so difficult to be open to friends about the fact that I am not fully straight.  


So, my social circle and family is very tolerant, most of my friends (including my mum) are feminists or at least sympathetic towards it. Something like homophobia is disproportionally rare in my culture, and especially in my environment. I see myself as progressive, and care deeply about social emancipation. Basically, for me there would be no danger in talking openly about my sexual preferences, in fact, I feel like it is a bit silly that I never do so. 

Likely one of the reasons is that on the spectrum, I err towards the straight side. I have had some queer experiments, but all my romantic relationships have been with women. That means that I can easily go through life as straight, without being really impeded by it much. Also because I am only a little bi, I would feel uncomfortable taking it up as an identity lable, because I don't want to be seen as someone trying to come across less privileged or 'vanilla' then they are. 

With some introspection I also had to conclude that a straight masculine ideal affects me, even though I disagree with it. That really bothers me, as I hoped I would be more 'liberated' than that. Basically I feel like on some level there is an urge to protect my masculine hetero status, as breaking it feels a bit scary and unknown (while I don't have a rational reason for being afraid).

Finally, I think that I should be able to just act freely in my sexuality without creating mental thresholds like ''assuming the bi identity''. However, if I were to, for example, be seen making out with a guy at a party, I feel like it would be construed as that. For some reason I don't (yet) have the courage to break out of this kind of petty, low-stakes mindgame that I have set up for myself.

Do people recognize these problems? Do you feel it warrants a 'coming out' as bi if you are only a little bi? Am I exaggerating this problem? I'd love to here from you.",True,225,0.98,58,,/r/MensLib/comments/fuv1ld/reluctance_to_talk_about_bisexual_preferences/,suchapersonwow
2020-04-04 08:41:02,"""If--"" by Rudyard Kipling","I absolutely love this poem and thought I'd share it here then discuss it below. 

*If you can keep your head when all about you   

    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,   

If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,

    But make allowance for their doubting too;   

If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,

    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,

Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,

    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:


If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;   

    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;   

If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster

    And treat those two impostors just the same;   

If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken

    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,

Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,

    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:


If you can make one heap of all your winnings

    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,

And lose, and start again at your beginnings

    And never breathe a word about your loss;

If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew

    To serve your turn long after they are gone,   

And so hold on when there is nothing in you

    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’


If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,   

    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,

If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,

    If all men count with you, but none too much;

If you can fill the unforgiving minute

    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,   

Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,   

    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!*

-----

This poem speaks to me in a way that no other ever has. It artfully describes the demands life makes of us all and gives great advice on how to deal with them. 

Act with confidence, but never think you're infallible. Have your dreams but deal with the reality in front of you. Think things through, but act decisively. Remain true to who you are, no matter who is around you. 

I particularly find the part about meeting with Triumph and Disaster and treating those ""imposters"" just the same resonates with me. I believe the meaning there is that both are transient things and neither defines you. What defines you is how you deal with them both. And how do you deal with both?  By examining them, asking, ""What went right? What went wrong? What could I have done differently to improve the outcome?"" and moving on better prepared for your next challenge. 

And while I'd never encourage anyone to gamble away their life's savings, I definitely agree with the sentiment expressed immediately after: After a big loss, the only thing to do is start again. Again, you don't let that loss define you. 

The only line I don't 100% agree with is about neither foes nor loving friends being able to hurt you. I believe he's talking about taking responsibility for your own happiness and not depending on others to make you happy, which is something that's healthy to an extent, but we're social creatures and need others. Besides, we all need to make a better effort to acknowledge and discuss it when we are hurt by others.

2020-04-01 20:19:24,Secrets Revealed? The Truth About The MensLib Moderators Exposed! [Gone Wrong][Gone Sexual] 110K Sub Special! Re-Upload,"[I’m Here To Make An Announcement.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLBL4M55tJU)

Some of you have noticed that I’ve been absent as a moderator for over a month or so. Some of you may not have noticed. Some of you may have noticed and either don’t care or have rejoiced. Some of you haven’t noticed and still don’t care. Some of you may be asking “who the fuck is this?”

None of that matters. What does matter is that I was unjustly fired from the /r/MensLib moderation team. Why? Well, toiling in the soy fields and running this shithole of a subreddit for so long made me just despise and be so frustrated with men that I eventually began to hate my own self as a man. I bit the bullet AKA an Impossible Burger and transitioned into a woman, leading to an all-out fist fight with /u/sailor_mini_moon on top of Millenium Tower to establish true female supremacy and who was better suited to restore the Tojo Clan… and also run /r/MensLib but mostly the first thing. Just when I was about to snatch victory from the gaping maw of defeat, she cheated by just blowing up the tower with planted bombs (again), took the role of head mod when I wasn’t around and basically left me on the streets with nothing but a banging body, a massive schlong, and a dream.

I have come out of the shadows to deliver a message to you all: DO NOT TRUST THE MENSLIB MODERATORS!!!

I have information accumulated from my years working with them that illustrate how they are not to be trusted. Crimes so heinous that it would tear the fabric of this community apart. Secrets so devastating that you will never look at internet janitors the same way again.

As you all know, our policy on complaints or feedback on the sub and its moderation is that it belongs in modmail and not in the comments. This is because we believe that meta discussions in /r/MensLib proper distract from the discussion of actual concrete men's issues. This is exacerbated by the fact that a small minority of redditors simply object to any and all moderation, under all circumstances, for a stated absolutist belief in free speech, which is more often than not a cover for a reactionary political agenda.

However, we do understand that having modmail be the only way to launch complaints can seem arbitrary and opaque. We also know that about 10% of Americans suffer from a condition called side-blindness, which manifests itself as a blind spot on the right hand side of their field of view. This perfectly covers the subreddit sidebar, leaving many people incapable of reading the rules or finding the modmail button.

# In order to make /r/MensLib more transparent and accessible, we are proud to launch a new subreddit for mod feedback

The sub is /r/MensLibMeta and the rules for it will be as follows.

* Everybody will be equally able to post feedback for the mods, even if they are banned from /r/MensLib. Nobody will be given any more or less access than anyone else.
* We will be doing absolutely no moderation of /r/MensLibMeta under any circumstances, in order to guarantee that all complaints are heard equally.
* Every post on /r/MensLibMeta will receive a full, in-depth response from the mod team within 24 hours
* Any moderator who receives more than 10 complaints in a week will be removed from the sub and replaced by an alternative chosen by the injured party

2020-03-31 19:01:14,Film Discussion: Positive Male Role Models,"This is the first of three posts which I want to make on the depiction of masculinity in film. It’s quite long, so please sit back, grab a coffee, and take your time.

This first post is on *Positive Male Role Models* specifically and I'd like to focus on this. I will define what I mean, with examples, and then list some examples of Positive Male Role Models at the end.

(WARNING SPOILERS THROUGHOUT)

**Positive Male Role Models**

What is *Positive* in this context? This is hard to define, and quite controversial. Some will say any male role model is positive, others will point to the classic traditional heroes and because the films frame them in a positive light, they will insist the characters are positive role models themselves. 

But the concept of toxic masculinity should lead us to examine our preconceptions and recognise that even if a hero is depicted positively within the film, and framed as “strong”, “successful”, “admirable”, and “virile”, the values and qualities that lead to the fictional hero’s positive depiction can actually be damaging, unhealthy, or unfairly burdensome if they are emulated by real people. 

For instance, the classic character of Bruce Willis in Die Hard demonstrates traditional masculine virtues of stubborn resilience, independent strength, loyalty, and a tendency to spit in the face of overwhelming odds. However, these are products of male power fantasy. In reality, and in day-to-day life, these “virtues” actually lead to a damaging inability to maintain mutually-respectful relationships, emotional isolation, and self-harmful behaviours.  

Indeed the films demonstrate a level of self-awareness in this regard as we see the films begin by depicting McClane’s utter failure in his personal life. Although this is just before the very qualities that ruined his marriage, distanced his children, and crippled his career are then lauded as exemplary virtues within the very particular extraordinary set of circumstances within the film’s action. Nevertheless, reality is that every single man watching the film would never face such a set of circumstances themselves, and so if they ever emulated McClane’s “virtues”, they would end up toxifying their lives rather than winning the day and getting the girl, though this would not be apparent on the surface.

The concept of toxic masculinity requires the awareness that the traditional masculine values as depicted by these fantasies, actually do not lead to the positive results that the films show, perhaps not even if Joe Ordinary was suddenly transplanted into those extraordinary circumstances, but certainly not in the day-to-day reality which Joe himself lives in. 

To properly analyse the masculinity presented, one needs to look beyond the surface depiction, the “film-world” in which the characters themselves live and act. In the film-world, a character can be shown to be successful when in the real-world, a person behaving as the character does would be a failure.

This of course, relies on our definition of “failure”. Traditionally, and in many of these films, a man only needs to be able to survive violent conflict, or rise above (i.e. ""stoically"" ignore) personal weaknesses such as cowardice, envy, greed, sorrow, or fear, in order to be considered successful. But, as Jesus said, “if a man gains the whole world yet loses his soul, what good is that?” 

We should consider true success to be more fundamental and all-encompassing. A healthy psychology, balanced emotions, harmonious relationships, loving behaviour.

I would highlight the following traits which I would use as benchmarks to discuss *Positive Male Role Models*. I would define the below as qualities which would lead to success in real-life. These are qualities which we should look for in our *Positive Male Role Models*, far more than strength of will, independence of spirit, refusal to accept defeat, etc. In any depiction of masculinity, I would use the following as a rule to define what I mean by Positive Masculinity and Toxic Masculinity. 

Firstly however, I would add a definition of what I mean by a ""Role Model"". There are many definitions of role model of course, and some will point out that even the worst person can still be an example and inspiration to others if he learns a lesson or does a single good deed despite his other failures. Many people will prefer to point to these character types as role models, they are certainly more prominent and popular in films. However, in this post I am focusing on a particular definition of ""Role Model"", specifically a character whom one can look up to as someone who has *already* successfully developed the *base minimum* characteristics of a generally healthy psychology, balanced emotions, harmonious relationships with those in his life, and loving behaviour. This type of Role Model provides unique cultural and psychological value which other types of character do not. They are of course far less common in films, as flawed characters are usually considered more interesting for a short story arc, but that is why I think it is important to highlight them.

**Socially Connected:**  
A successful man is one who can maintain healthy relationships with others. This should be obvious. But it is extremely rare in films. The classic traditional masculine hero is a loner. Films are filled with male role models who abandon their families, friends, and society as a whole, in order to pursue some external goal or inner dream. This may be a personal ambition, mattering only to them, or, of course, they may be “saving the world”. The reason for their social isolation is beside the point however. The result is either a neglect of, or an inability to maintain healthy relationships. Occasionally such men learn their lesson near the end of the film, and discover the “power of love”, or “power of friendship”, but these are often depicted as rewards for their pursuit of their personal ambition rather than a correction to it. 

For instance the “Pursuit of Happyness” is an example of this. After googling this subject, in every internet list Chris Gardner is unfailingly cited as an example of a Positive Male Role Model. Yet Gardner abandons everything except his son in order to pursue his “American dream” of corporate success and wealth. As he takes an unpaid internship in order to pursue his dream he puts himself and his son through deprivation and distress (which any social worker would see as reason to take his son away from him). Yet this is presented within the film as Gardner being a loving father, and at the end of the film his dedication to his personal ambitions is rewarded not only with the corporate and financial success he desired, but also with a tender and rewarding relationship with his son. 

In reality however, this desperate drive to put one’s own ambitions before the comfort and security of one’s family is a toxic quality, and in real-life it leads to much familial resentment, broken relationships, and emotionally neglected children. The Positive opposite of this would be a man who took a low-paid and less personally rewarding job so that he could ensure his son didn’t have to sleep in a public toilet cubicle (this literally happens in the film). 

As a caveat, by “reality”, I mean the average or typical experience. “The Pursuit of Happyness” is of course supposedly based on a true story. But even if the author is being wholly truthful, his experience would not be typical. He would be one of the lucky few, and the majority of the people who made the choices he did would end up with damaged relationships, broken lives, and emotional ill-health.

This quality of social-connectivity also excludes all of the “Mysterious old wizard” characters who are one of the most recognizable *traditional* positive role models for men. Obi-Wan, Yoda, Dumbledore, Mr Miyagi, and Gandalf for instance would traditionally be seen as extremely positive role models for men, because in the films they are framed as wise, kindly, gentle, yet with incredible hidden strengths and abilities, and always serve as the mentor-figure for the protagonist, teachers and examples for the protagonist to learn from. 

Yet, if we look beyond the fantasy of the “film-world” what would be the result of Joe Ordinary emulating these men? These men have abandoned society and any healthy long-term relationship in order to pursue an isolated and cloistered existence in order to devote themselves to their own obsessions. For Obi-Wan and Yoda, their hermitage is explained (vaguely) in the prequels as a necessary exile, yet it doesn’t take much to ask the question, “Really?” And, of course, whatever excuses the film may provide for its characters, this is beside the point. It is the consequences we are concerned about.

These “Mysterious old wizard” characters often have a mentor-type relationship with a single, particular “chosen one”, but this is part of the “film-world” and these fictional interactions are not replacements for regular healthy long-term relationships. Even if the old monk, ancient wizard, or grandfather is a positive presence in the film protagonist’s life, that also is beside the point. We must step outside the film-world and recognise that spending decades on one’s own, cut-off from the richness and reward of mutually-giving and loving relationships, just to impart a few minutes of mysterious wisdom on one young person isn’t actually a healthy way to live. In reality this kind of behaviour would lead to mental illness and a crippling of one’s ability to relate to others at all.

Not only are the “Mysterious old Wizard” characters excluded, so too must we exclude the other, most recognizable and popular male character, the “Lone Gunslinger”. This character is endearingly popular, no less so today than it has ever been. There are often excuses for the Lone Gunslinger’s isolation, perhaps they used to be a family man but their loved one died tragically, perhaps they are on an extremely important quest. The excuse the film gives them is beside the point however. Whether the character is presented as simply as ‘The Man with No Name’ from ‘The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly’, who is given no backstory at all, or is given a token excuse such as John Wick’s tragically dead wife, the result is the same. The “Lone Gunslinger” works alone, travels alone, fights alone. And this is true even if he is with someone else. Sometimes he allies with a secondary character for a short time, but never for long, and it’s always a one-way street, the secondary character is there to help the Lone Gunslinger achieve his goal, and then the Gunslinger is off again, riding towards the sunset. The Lone Gunslinger always keeps others at arm’s length, he doesn’t open up personally, or share any genuine friendships other than a working one. Though the film may give him many people who call him a friend, they are always acting in the role of servants, usually because of a debt they owe him, or some act of true friendship which is long in the past and never depicted.

Sometimes, the Lone Gunslinger is presented in a very positive light, for example with the character of Aragorn. Yet the underlying qualities of the character remain. He begins as “Strider”, a socially-isolated wandering ranger. And although through the films, he works with others within a fellowship yet even as part of a group, the Lone Gunslinger’s inherently unhealthy qualities remain. He keeps others at arm’s length. He doesn’t easily open up about his past. He is one that will always stand slightly apart from others (except for his one true love, of course – the only one who he can truly connect with, though this is a purely idealised relationship). For we must not interpret Aragorn as positive just because he is represented as such within the exceptional circumstances of the film-world, but we must imagine his qualities if they were emulated and practised by Joe Ordinary in his daily-life. Would they still be positive qualities? Would they lead to a positive and healthy life? I would say that they would lead to arrogance, pride, social-isolation, and an inability to properly relate to others. Joe Ordinary simply cannot emulate Aragorn, and any attempt to do so would be unhealthy for him.

**Emotionally Open:**  
Often tied to being socially connected, a successful and healthy man is one who can be emotionally open with others. Repressed emotions lead to negative behaviours. This is a basic truth of psychology. Yet, again, depictions of emotionally-open men are extremely rare in films. Most male role models are emotionally-closed-off, incapable of expressing their emotions except through sublimation into other activities, usually competitive activities. Men are depicted as more comfortable with communicating through actions than with words, and their actions are usually simple displays of dominance, or control, or unhealthy explosions of rage, obsession, or grief. And an uncontrolled explosion of emotion is not “emotional-openness” as a positive quality. Emotional-openness must be tempered by self-awareness and balance, and be non-harmful to others, even when the emotion is powerful.

Being emotionally-closed-off is often linked with social-isolation, but not always. For instance, Rocky is quite well socially-connected, a part of the community, always greeting his neighbours, and well-liked. Yet for all his positive qualities, he is still incapable of expressing his emotions except through beating up other men in the ring. His is plagued by a deep-rooted insecurity that drives him back to the ring again and again, putting his life, health, and family’s welfare at risk repeatedly simply so that he can feel he has self-worth. Yet despite his success, this sense of self-worth is always transitory and passing, requiring it to be repeated continually. He is fundamentally an example of unhealthy masculinity, crippled by his insecurities into seeking self-worth through inherently damaging means.

This quality would also exclude such examples as Marlin from Finding Nemo. Despite being an example of a dedicated and self-sacrificing father, he is emotionally closed-off as a result of previous emotional trauma. This leads to him smothering his son, and leading a fearful life. And while fear and worry are emotions, these outbursts of uncontrolled emotion are not a product of emotional-openness but repressed grief and guilt. While Marlin learns a lesson about this during the film (and again in the second film), within the film itself he does not serve as a Positive Role Model who should be emulated.

**Peaceful:**  
Again, often connected with the above qualities, a successful and healthy man is one who can live at peace with others, without needing to beat others or prove himself better than them in order to be satisfied. This is not just peacefulness in terms of violence, but also in terms of competitiveness. 

This is a more controversial quality. I am not saying that competitiveness is inherently unhealthy, or that all sportsmen are psychologically unhealthy. Competition can be engaged in healthily. However, the drive to achieve self-worth *through* competition is unhealthy. It is the obsession, or the need to beat others that is damaging. Or just the need to prove oneself, through winning recognition or fame through competition. It is the sense that a person cannot be satisfied with themselves, unless they are recognised as better than those around them. Fundamentally it is the fixed coupling of one’s self-worth to success of any kind. If success (whether in work, sport, or battle) is seen as increasing someone’s worth, then any reverse or frustration will not just be an external event, but will damage a person’s sense of their own value, and furthermore no success will ever be enough. This drive to seek self-worth through success over others is a form of envy, and leads to continuous dissatisfaction, as any victory is fleeting, and no success is ever enough. 

Rather, a positive and healthy man would be able to be a graceful loser, to enjoy any game for its own sake and, in the words of Rudyard Kipling, “meet with Triumph and Disaster, And treat those two impostors just the same”. A healthy man recognises that a game is just a game (or job, or sport, or any other competition), and the man who loses is just as much a valued and worthy man as the one who succeeds.

This quality would exclude positive depictions of men such as Eddie the Eagle in the eponymous film. Despite his other positive qualities, his desperate desire to seek personal fame and success by defeating others in the Olympics actually leads to an unhealthy life, causing him to break his relationships with his loving parents, and driving him to put his life at risk again and again. 

More surprisingly for many, this would also exclude such otherwise-positive characters as Captain America, Superman (Christopher Reeves, of course) and Spiderman. Although they demonstrate many positive traits that can be emulated, their approach to problems is almost always to physically overpower them. This is the fundamental problem with all superheroes. Because they are intended to be heroic their characters will always come adorned with many characteristics which can be viewed as positive. But their plot demands that they are all framed within a world and scenario that resolves its problems through violence. These films reward their protagonists based on the rule of right-makes-might. This is the inverse of might-makes-right but the coupling of the traits is just as intentional. Rather than presenting the worldview that the strongest is therefore the better person, it presents the worldview that the better person is therefore the strongest. 

Indeed often the strength of the hero increases or decreases (either overtly or through subtext) depending on how good of a person they act. See Thor, for instance, which is the most obvious example of the linking of “moral worthiness” (though what that means is kept helpfully vague) with strength and success. But the concept of “good” or “worthy” within the film-world is often very different from what is “positive”. 

In Thor, moral worthiness is understood as connected with self-sacrificial risk. Thor’s selfish desire for personal glory at the expense of his friends makes him lose his powers, but when he proves willing to sacrifice his own life to protect his friends Thor receives his superpowers again. In Spiderman 2, Peter begins to lose his powers, which is hinted to be because of his conflict within himself between his desire to be with MJ and with being Spiderman. The film is quite on-the-nose about it, with Doc Ock saying to Peter early on, “Love should never be kept secret. If you keep something as complicated as love stored up inside, it could make you sick.” This is an interesting example as although this film’s theme could have been an encouragement towards “emotional-openness”, Peter’s powers return, not when he is honest with MJ (he keeps his love for her secret even at the close of the film), but when he resolves his conflict by effectively suppressing his desire for a normal life and embracing his Spiderman persona fully. This suppression of his normal emotions, and enforced secrecy of his true feelings in the service of “heroism” makes sense within the film-world but is not a “positive” quality as it is inherently psychologically damaging in real-life. 

Superhero films provide a classic example of looking beyond the film-world and asking the question, what would happen to Joe Ordinary if he actually tried to emulate these characters? I believe the results would actually look very different from how are depicted in the films (even if we exclude magical powers). Success through physically overpowering enemies or obstacles is not a positive trait because it cannot be emulated, it is ultimately a fantasy that leads to and nurtures an unhealthy perspective that good people will be mightier and more successful than others, and therefore weaker or less successful people are less worthy and less valued. Within the specific events of the film’s world, the actions of the hero are framed as inherently positive, and rewarded with success. But outside the film-world, similar actions would be damaging and be typically met with defeat, frustration, or simple escalation of violence and an increasing level of harm.

Even outside of violence, this quality is very different from how male competitiveness in general is traditionally presented. Competitiveness is commonly understood as an extremely positive quality, a drive that leads one to achieve great things, and without it, nothing great or impressive could be accomplished. It is commonly understood that no one would excel unless they were driven to excel by some inner need. And this may be true, the greatest accomplishments of history may well be the result of this quality. However, it does not result in a healthy life or in lasting satisfaction. It damages relationships, and leads to self-damaging behaviours, as well as damaging one’s sense of self-worth. If society asks men to sacrifice their happiness and health in order to produce impressive feats and achievements, then is that a fair trade for the individual?

**Compassionate:**  
At this point, we are getting into consequences of positive masculinity rather than causes. I am using this quality as a referent for all positive consequences. A man who is socially-connected, emotionally open, and peaceful will, I believe, naturally go on to exhibit qualities of compassion; generosity, kindness to others, and self-sacrificial love. A man who is not depicted as exhibiting these qualities, yet exhibits the rest of the above, may just be a result of poor writing. In any case, if they are depicted as showing the opposite qualities; cruelty, callousness, miserliness, abusiveness, or selfishness, then they should be excluded as an example of positive masculinity by default. 

Sometimes, a character can show these qualities while not demonstrating some of the others above. This is often because of some trauma in their past which has circumscribed their ability to connect with the wider world. For instance, Newt Scamander in Fantastic Beasts demonstrates great compassion towards animals and his small circle of friends, but is otherwise socially-isolated and emotionally-closed off towards the wider world (effectively symbolised by his life-within-a-suitcase, which remains closed and secret, even though the locks are only intermittently secure). For this reason, while he is an example of positive *alternative masculinity*, he cannot be used directly as a positive role model. This will be the subject of a second post in the future.

**Complete:**  
Finally, I will add this one. In many films, we see a damaged or troubled character who have personal issues they need to overcome. By the end of the film they may learn an important life-lesson which is an example of Positive Masculinity. This is certainty an example of positive masculinity in film, and I am planning to write more about this in a subsequent post. However, I wanted to focus specifically on the concept of ""Role Models"" in this post. While characters that learn positive lessons can be helpful inspirations for us, the Role Model is a specific type of character that is separate from the flawed hero who learns to be better.

In order to serve as a Role Model I would argue that a character needs to already be complete and demonstrating Positive characteristics fully from the beginning of the film. A damaged or troubled character can certainly show positive qualities in overcoming their issues or bettering themselves. But I would term such characters as “Inspirational” for the viewer rather than “Aspirational”. To qualify directly as a Role Model in particular, a character must not be incomplete, damaged or traumatised, even though this would not disqualify a real-life person from being considered positive. 

A Role Model is not someone who is *becoming* a Role Model, or learns to become one, but someone who *is* a Role Model already. This is because the Role Model is someone who has *achieved* success at being an emotionally-open, socially-connected, peaceful man, and thus can be looked up to by other characters (and the viewer) as a goal to aim for in the development of one's own character. They represent the idea that it is possible for adult men to exist who are completely positive characters. This is an important (and largely missing) representation of masculinity in film. Most men in film are presented as needing to be fixed in some way. 

The representation of damaged, negligent, distant, sexually-selfish, violent, needy, emotionally-repressed men are innumerable, and while they often learn lessons that fix some (or even all) of these issues, I think it is important to represent the existence of men who aren't negative until the plot, or another character, manages to fix them. Ultimately, we must aim for the idea that men *shouldn't need* to be fixed. We should already be positive characters. The fact that many of us aren't is a social failing that needs to be corrected. And one strong way that media can correct it is through the normalisation of positive male characters, not always the normalisation of *negative-but-fixable* male characters.

**Examples:**  
Finally, if you’ve read this far, you have earned the chance to suggest your own example of *Positive Male Role Models* from films. They do not have to be protagonists, but they do need to have enough screen time that we can say something about them. Please post the film, the character you’re thinking of, and an explanation of why you think they qualify as a *Positive Male Role Model*.

If you disagree with any of my qualifications above, then you are free to post examples of Role Models that contradict them, but please pay attention to my points above and explain why you think I’m wrong. Don’t just post, “I think Rambo’s cool”, without any explanation. 

My own examples of some films which portray *Positive male role models* are as follows:

*Slumdog Millionaire*  
Throughout the film, Jamal demonstrates a desire to protect Latika from harm, not seeking to win her out of a selfish desire to possess her, but in order to protect her from those who seek to use her and treat her as property. One gets the impression that even if she did not love him back and wanted to only be friends, he would still act exactly the same out of his self-sacrificing love for her.
In other regards, Jamal does not avoid society, but embraces other people as best he can in his circumstances. And interestingly for a show about winning a million dollars, he does not care about the money, he enters the competition only as a means to rescue Latika. He is emotionally open and speaks of his past traumas freely when asked, without repressing them or sublimating them. He is not perfect, as I would say his social-connectivity and peacefulness could do with some work. But I think he is certainly worthy of inclusion.

*Hacksaw Ridge*  
Desmond demonstrates a self-sacrificial desire to save others at his own expense. This is not at the expense of his social-connectivity or his peacefulness, since he enters the army as a determined non-combatant, and maintains solid relationships with his family back home, and with his new comrades (eventually). He does not seek isolation, nor does he pursue his goal at the expense of others. He also remains emotionally open throughout.

*A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood*  
I think this is an obvious one, so shouldn’t need explanation.

*Princess Mononoke*  
A brilliant example of a peaceful warrior, which Japanese cinema perhaps does far better than the West. Ashitaka never uses his strength or skill of arms to harm others except as a last resort in the pursuit of peace, and even then he sincerely regrets it afterwards. He continually seeks peace, even during wartime, not seeking to defeat enemies but to reconcile with them. Despite being an armed warrior, it is this sincere desire for reconciliation between enemies which prevents him from becoming a traditionally toxic warrior hero. 

Ashitaka never gives up trying to protect others, not through taking lives, but through saving them. For him, a death is always a tragedy, even, right at the beginning the death of a demon who threatened to destroy his village. He immediately sees that the boar demon has been corrupted by events outside his control, and regrets having to kill him. And when he is fleeing unnamed samurai who attack him without cause, he is forced to kill them in order to escape and expresses sincere regret again afterwards. Even when faced with implacable opponents, he never loses his regard for them as human beings, or seeks their destruction. At the end he allows both Jigo and Eboshi to leave peacefully, which is quite a shock to the viewer who expects some level of comeuppance to morally punish them for their selfish and short-sighted mistakes. 

This is also an example of how someone being on a lone quest doesn’t have to turn them into the “Lone Gunslinger” archetype. Despite having had to leave all of his previous relationships through the demon’s curse, this is never used as an excuse for Ashitaka to keep others at a distance, or be socially-isolated or emotionally-closed. He always seeks genuine connections with the people he meets along the way, and shows sincere care, respect, and sympathy for even the lowliest person he meets, even if they themselves show him hostility. And at the end he doesn’t ride off into the sunset, but remains with the town he’s saved.

He spent 25 years in 22 prisons looking for someone to help him, but unable to ask for it due to his belief of never being allowed to ask for these things due to being male. He had an international best selling book and movie talking about his time in Thailand in jail (A Prayer Before Dawn). He talks about bottling up of emotions and never being able to talk about them due to the persona he thought he needed to show, how we got himself into trouble and how he got out of his spiral.

I think what makes this one unique is the opposing views the co-hosts take. One is an empath while the other is more what you would call the ""traditional"" male, a bit more stuck in his ways. 

The empath, LV (Lavaughn)  is married (7 years) with two daughters (aged 4 and 1) while the other is a single divorced father of one son (aged 5). Both come from very different backgrounds and upbringings so it makes for some very interesting and oppositional dialogue.

2020-03-29 08:42:59,Are men generally more prepared for the touch starved reality of pandemic?,"To preface, this is more of a shower thought than a fully researched argument.

Anecdotally, I feel like there has been an increase in the number of threads I've been reading around Reddit where men are posting about suddenly being hit up by women in their life. Many are innocent, like talking about cuddling and making plans to cuddle and watch a movie when social distancing is less vital. Some are aggressively sexual, like a few I read where a female friend with a slightly flirty history suddenly sent a risque text or pic, initiating some safe distance fun.   

What really got me thinking about it was a comment on one of those posts suggesting that the woman felt more safe during this time and secure that the physical distance was a significant barrier to overcome. This seems like a good reason but it felt lacking, in need of something to catalyze the desire into action. These are women who are willing to make the first move and these are men they have known for a while. It seems to me that the opportunity was surly there before social distancing and that safety is likely less of a concern with someone you've know for some time.

As the title says: are men generally more prepared for the touch starved reality of pandemic? 

Much like how men, in general, are more prepared for romantic rejection than women, practice makes perfect. Because of the many systemic factors discussed on this subreddit, men are raised that less platonic touching is acceptable and may feel like they often have to suppress the urge for romantic and sexual touch. In my opinion, this doesn't even necessitate that the person in question had a lot of physical contact prior, but felt secure knowing that the option was available; similar to the pick-up artist concept of ""Abundance Mentality"", where getting into the frame of mind that you DO have many options makes it easier to be confident and in control of yourself. Romantically, woman are usually assumed to have abundance mentality by default, maybe not an abundance of high value men, but rarely zero options.

I keep saying ""in general"" because I don't think this is gendered at it's core. I think it is possible that anyone who is used too an abundance of touch (platonic, romantic, sexual) is going through a form of touch withdrawal right now. For some, this may be the first time in their lives to have such a stark lack of physical contact. Like a drug withdrawal, I'm sure many will come out the other side of this pandemic feeling like the ""morning after"". Feeling like they did something they would not have done when clear headed. Not to imply that they will regret it, but many will, like being lonely enough to reach out to that toxic ex. 

I love this community because I often get exposed to a variety of opinions and viewpoints, almost all respectfully given. And I would love to know what others think about this and maybe even discuss how to help those going through it.",True,88,0.97,64,,/r/MensLib/comments/fqwexq/are_men_generally_more_prepared_for_the_touch/,AngelusYukito
2020-03-27 16:04:54,Is men's sexuality demonized?,"Hi! I'm a woman I can definitely say that women's sexuality is demonized. I live in a small and backward city, where even having a boyfriend means you're a slut (They don't care about me since I'm a lesbian but yeah) And obviously there are places in the world where women can be killed for having sex.

But my question is, how far is MEN's sexuality demonized? I've known some men to be criticized for sleeping with several women and being called playboy, fuckboi etc. To be fair, some of these men are known as playboys because some of them treat women badly after sleeping with them, but are they really being criticized for the right thing? Are they being criticized for having 'too much' sex or for treating women badly?

To me the de-demonization of consensual sex is very important because it is the first step to normalizing sex education for all genders. 

So, in your opinions, how far does Men's sexuality (Not including homophobia/biphobia) get demonized?

2020-03-27 10:20:34,Indoctrination of men and masculinity within religious schooling and upbringings,"I was reflecting today on the ‘ethical teachings’ I received growing up catholic and attending a seventh-day Adventist school. I believe, today, that many of the things I learned were damaging and propaganda, despite being led to believe that the school was simply guiding me to make my own ethical decisions later in my life and not trying to convince me to be a Christian.

I also reflected on how these beliefs I was taught may have impacted my views of men and masculinity. As such, I want to ask everyone here whether they believe their religious upbringings affected their view of gender, society and culture in general.

Personally, I think believing in Christianity led me to also subsequently adopt as an adolescent traditional judeo-Christian beliefs of gender and sex being the same thing, homosexuality being wrong and that atheism leads to a worldview without ethics or hope.

>   [Simply put, the majority of men secretly disagree with how we have been taught to be men, but act as if we don’t.  Why?  Because we wrongly assume that most other men believe in what we have been taught to be as men, and also because we fear their disapproval were we to reveal the truth.  The result is “role-conflict,” a state of inner conflict and stress resulting in impaired mental and physical health.](http://alanberkowitz.com/articles/college_men.pdf) 

For example, [men perceive a discrepancy between their true self and the perceived expectations of their gender role](http://alanberkowitz.com/articles/college_men.pdf) in areas such as drug/alcohol use, attitudes towards women and sex, and pro-sociality. 

In particular, men tend to *overestimate* other men's:
  
* use of alcohol and other drugs 

* amount of sexual activity  

* desire to “hook-up” 

* belief in rape myths 

* interest in gambling  

* willingness to use force to have sex 

* frequency of unwanted sexual activity 

* acceptance of homophobia 
 
...while *underestimating* other men's: 

* discomfort with language or behavior that objectifies or degrades women 

* willingness to intervene to prevent sexual assault

* desire to ensure they have consent when sexually active

* desire for a socially just world and to act against injustice.

2020-03-23 00:03:04,"Let’s talk about respect. Though more specifically, the leveraging of “disrespect” and a potential generational divide.","I don’t want to make this post too lengthy, mostly because my relationship with my father could be a novel series, but hopefully discussion in the comments will be fruitful.

I wanted to draw attention to something I have been mulling over recently. To make a long story short, my father recently exposed himself (something i knew but hadn’t outwardly seen) as a vitriolic racist. As a white man in an interracial relationship, and as a victim to my father’s dysfunctional parenting and emotional vacancy, I decided this was the final straw and I’ve put my foot down.

My girlfriend was supposed to meet my family this past Sunday for a baptism (i’m atheist, family catholic), we’re semi-long distance and she was with me for the weekend so it felt like a good chance. She was looking forward to it. I had already been texting with my father about the fed propping up a failing market with what could’ve ended the student loan crisis. My father is in his early 60s, a traditional conservative turned trump-cultist whose pride is more hardy than diamond. I remembered the baptism and let him know I’d be bringing my girlfriend. Then, because it’s no secret now that he’s a bigot, I simply said “and I expect you to behave yourself.” Given the context, and what we know, I figured this was tame at best. Apparently not to him...

He exploded, basically. Unfortunately it sort of spiraled out from there into a conversation about his general failure as a father to connect with one of his sons (me) because unlike my brother, I don’t have much in common with him. But something that kept coming up, and what bothered me the most, is his insistence that my statement was disrespectful.


Let’s talk about respect. This is why I mention generational divides. I feel like this “respect your elders no matter what” steadfast social rule exists only in the minds of the current “elders” and those who’ve they’ve successfully convinced to believe it. Was he disrespectful when he went on a 20 minute racist rant over the holidays, targeting a race my partner belongs to? Absolutely. Was I disrespectful when I subsequently requested that he behave when I bring her around the family? He sure seems to think so, I don’t agree. Still I see it everywhere in the older generations, constant bemoaning about obligatory respect and lashing out at younger actors whom they believe to be violating a guaranteed right.

It may not be an unpopular opinion here, but I believe respect is earned. I believe it’s earned in individual ways as well as in general. I can respect someone’s hard work, but not their hateful rhetoric. I can respect someone’s kindness to friends, but be critical of their non-inclusive treatment of strangers. I believe respect is *earned* and not just once, but every day and every moment. 

I also believe treating others with respect, even when they don’t deserve it, is the mark of a good person.


I’m realizing this post is all over the place now but I had a question to round it out, to hopefully get some feedback to implement in my life moving forward: How can we navigate relationships where a person acts with constant disrespect for others, then demands respect in return, and shuts down completely if they feel that respect isn’t being gratuitously delivered?

I’m *not* going to use this as fodder for the noxious ‘everyone’s a little bisexual’ canard. Jalees describes herself as gay. I absolutely take her word for it.

I will, however, argue that there are hints in her comedic storytelling about how [compulsory heterosexuality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_Heterosexuality_and_Lesbian_Existence) and the noxious patriarchal structures we all have to wade through fuck things up for all of us.

Because, Jalees, someone who happily understands herself to be a lesbian, was able to be taken by the beauty of a man and, even further, be taken by his desire for her.

And she was able to do this because *there was no pressure*. No heteronormative expectations. No patriarchal assumptions.

Indeed, Jalees being the client — however problematic Capitalism is — turned such assumptions on their head. The dancer’s goal was to entertain and please his client (Jalees). Which allowed her to take what she would from his performance, knowing it was all in her hands (pun sort of intended).

She wanted to be there, and he was not trying to do anything other than have her enjoy his presence. And, in that moment, in that circumstance, the beauty and delight of that dancer’s sexuality was appealing to her.

Two take-away points for me.

1. It’s fucking terrible that such moments are so damned hard to come by. 

2. I really, really, really, really, wish (way too many) straight men *in particular* would fucking understand this. That they can be beautiful, if they’d only put in the energy to be so. And that this is as much about how they deport themselves as it is how the present themselves. And that they can be desired. And that being desired is not some affront to their masculinity. Hell, it’s the fucking acknowledgement of and delight in that damned masculinity.",True,914,0.83,226,,/r/MensLib/comments/fjh148/canadian_comedian_sabrina_jalees_recounts_her/,ruchenn

A new study from the University of Michigan has found that men who exhibit toxic masculine traits are more likely to suffer health and isolation issues as they age. The study observes that these men often refuse to ""seek out help"" and believe in being ""autonomous"" and self-reliant. In return, they develop high likeliness of becoming very alone as well.

I know the right wing make a lot out of ""feminizing"" boys, but it sure seems to be necessary on some level. Considering feminizing often means teaching them emotional skills and sensitivity, two traits that when men lack them, they end up in bad places.  We evidently need a cultural shift to make boys and men being emotionally open and vulnerable more acceptable, to be willing to not feel ashamed of needing help. The question then becomes, I guess, how to we go about achieving that? The burden is often put on women to be men's helping hand, but we need to really make men accountable in deconstructing toxic masculine values as well. If women are doing most of the work, it'll just reinforce the same toxic gender stereotypes, as well as simply be more ineffectual without men being the ones pushing the gendered change. If it's women doing most of the labour, it just looks like ""women attacking boys for being boys"" and too easy for right wingers to spin it into sensationalize ""anti-male"" angles.

Another question is why, when toxic macho stuff is so harmful, do men continue to support it? It paints a picture that for some men out there being masculine is more important than being well. Why have our gendered values gotten so entrenched in our lives that this is the case? If toxic masculinity is so harmful why exactly is it so hard to get men to see that and start changing the gender script?

2020-03-15 14:10:04,COVID19 - stay at home!,"COVID19 apparently kills more men than women. And once there is competition for hospital beds and equipment, I suspect men's lives will not be prioritized. So I figure this is appropriate to post here - though in any case, I'll be posting about it on any platform I can and I advise you to spread the word too.

Any politician who tells you the situation is under control is lying. Most Western countries are on the same trajectory with COVID19 cases doubling roughly every three days, as illustrated by this sobering graph: [https://twitter.com/AusSeaSteph/status/1238941980291284993](https://twitter.com/AusSeaSteph/status/1238941980291284993)

This means most Western countries are 1-2 weeks behind Italy.

In Italy right now, doctors are having to choose who gets a chance to live because they don't have enough hospital beds. Middle-aged people might have a lower death rate, but can still get critically ill and compete with older people for beds and equipment that don't exist.

People are failing to understand the power of exponential growth, a 14-day incubation period, and overwhelming of the hospital system. COVID-19 is spreading like the flu but is 40 times more deadly.

The only way to delay, let alone prevent, your country becoming like Italy is through social distancing. That means stay at home and stay away from people as much as possible - society will catch up to you in a week anyway. Don't go to sporting events. Don't go to church. Don't go to parties and social gatherings. Don't go to school. Don't go near a hospital or a doctor if you're not sick. Don't visit your elderly relatives, or visit anyone for that matter. Don't go anywhere you don't need to.

It is up to each non-essential workplace and organization to facilitate this even if your government won't. These measures are generally being advocated from the bottom up rather than the top down, so you should be loudly advocating for such measures even if it makes you temporarily unpopular.

#Part 1: Science and Gender 

###Biology and The Brain by Markhem Heid

*Science in exploring how much if gender expression is shaped by our life experience — and how much of it is hardwired.*


This article breaks down what is and isn't true about neurological differences between the sexes. While a history of medical bias where women were referred to as ""little men with menstrual cycles"" have allowed scientists to overlook legitimate efficacy differences of drugs scientists are now coming to terms that certain conditions like depression, stress and seizures manifest different in men and work and function differently in the brain as well. Another emerging discovering in brain development points towards girls who experience protracted trauma have increase her risk for depression and emotional regulation whereas men show similar risk as lack of impulse control and aggression. Scientists stress that ignoring the current science about where men and women difference is a bad move, and it's critical to understand that different doesn't mean one is better or worse. 

What the science doesn't allow researchers to do is to predict behavior or look at a brain scan of any individual and make an informed decision on The gender of the individual. Population trends show sex distinctions on average, just as we experience it in life - men are taller and women are shorter. But any woman could be taller than any man, and any man could be shorter than any particular women. Furthermore ""the human brain tends to shrug off all attempts at male-female categorization at the level of behavior or cognition"". There are no absolutes here.

####""Each brain in a unique mosaic""

Even when scientists don't agree with what differences exist, they still agree that ""sex based discrepancies in structure or connectivity undergird most female-male stereotypes"". The environment of people still plays a large role, ""putting men and women into boxes denies the complexity of the human brain"". It's humans own adaptability that has created the conditions that make environment weight heavily on our development.

###Fueling & Gender by Janette Beebe

*From the womb to well past puberty, genes and hormones shape and drive gendered behavior — whatever that means — and gender identity too.*

This article takes a deeper look at hormones  and the role they play while paired to a story about a AMAB girl going through her transition consisting of puberty blockers and hormone therapy. 

Hormones play a large role at two stages, when a child is still in the womb and at puberty. While most things are still uncertain in the womb (with unsexed gonads and genitals) they really surge at puberty, producing androgens in men and estrogens in women which are responsible for developing their respective sex, creating what is known as sexual dimoprhism - where men appear for male-typical and women appear more female-typical. 

This article stresses sex development isn't always straight forward. Generally, high levels of DHT and SRY (genes referred to as the ""spark plugs"" of sexual differentiation) leads to a male and lower DHT and SRY leads to a female. But cases like classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia can produce girls (XX chromosome, or XXX) with ambiguous genitalia if they are over-exposed to androgens. 

What one scientist discovered though from this otherwise straightforward chemical difference is that these girls still identify as girls but more generally prefer toys and activities that are more ""boyish"". Along with this finding these girls also joined their male counterparts in being more successful on tests regarding spatial tasks. 

Once again however it is stresses that individual potential is paramount. "" The variance within each sex is far greater than the variance between each sex"".

###Mating: It's all About Babies by Barbara Sadick

*Reproduction is necessary tot he survival of the species — and an evolutionary imperative that has driven both genders.*

This article moves past the reductive myth that because women produce relatively few eggs and men produce sperm on a continuous basis that this justifies what sociobioloigists decades used to explain women's more reserved and selective mating preferences and men's more indiscriminate and cavalier behavior.

This article first cited hunter-gatherer arrangements (with small groups rather than bonded pairs) in which humans ""may have mated more promiscuously... [so] the more men who the female mated, the more, theoretically, might have a potential interest in looking after her offspring"" - literally taking the village. This article offers that as society became less tribal, it too became more magnanimous, focusing on pair-bonding - still this didn't require exclusivity, there is still ""a fair amount"" of promiscuous sex found in many pair-bonded species.

The myth of ""The Bateman Principle"" came about by studying fruit flies and found that male flies found advantages in reproductive success from multiple partners and females did not. This quickly left the world of insects and was used to even generally apply to humans. This theory, however, completely overlooked the ways that it's advantages to females whose mates multiply. One fact when it comes to make promiscuity that is frequently overlooked are the male partners who might be the parent but cared for it as if it actually were. The Bateman principle is false on the face of it, in regards to birds, or chimps, or even the Himba people of Namibia ""for whom infidelity is an accepted fact of life"". Later the Bateman test would be attempted again at UCLA and the University of Georgia where they discovered the results didn't hold up and non-surviving offspring as never included in the results - skewing the data.

Seeking once more to reinforce that any averages in mating behavior ultimately breaks down when observing the individual the article reminds us that there are countless men and women who remain in faithful magnanimous relationships where neither mother or father fall victim to some pre-wired and gendered reproductive strategy and that the pair-bonding, child rearing imperative benefits both sexes.

###Lessons From Animals by Courtney Mifsud

*The Differences between the sexes in the animal kingdom are vast and wild. These dualities point to a striking picture when compared to our own gender divides.*

This article explores sexual dimorphism and how appearances and roles vary greatly across the animal kingdom - from lionesses doing both child-rearing and hunting and male peacocks who have all the glamour. WHen it comes to size differences humans and birds tend to hold the standard of men being larger - this starts to beak down in other areas of the animal kingdom. Habitat and competition play large roles in the adaptive paths of many species like where female fish are larger allowing them to be found more easily in the expansive sea and be able to produce a much larger amount of eggs. Males are smaller to have more momentum in order to find females in the same expanse.

Like in humans, androgens play a role in gender-bending as well. in 2016 researchers discovered female lionesses started to develop manes and even mounted lions as they became masculinized. They also appeared to be ultimately infertile, as is typical in these cases, because of the imbalance of hormones in development. With fish. 2% are estimated to have some form of  hermaphroditism. The Blue streak cleaner wrasse will transform form female to male if the leader of their harem ever dies. This sex-fluidity is also found in some corals, snakes, insects, and slugs. This poses that if sex-fluidity is possible, what about gender? What is shown in species like Bonobos is that simply appearance and behavior can inform gender as much as evolutionary design. That includes living the life opposite to the gender assigned at birth.

####""Gender is the appearance, behavior and *life history* of a sexed body""

___

###Health Research Revealed

*From different life spans to bone health and treatment varioations, researchers are uncovering new findings in the unique health concerns of sex.*

This section has too much nuance to be able to summarize without quoting the whole article. What is attempts to show is the complexity in understanding the causes in health concerns. Men sufferer more heart attacks in part because they were more likely to smoke - in part because they were more likely to experience more stressors from work. When women started working they too started to catch up. While men experience a earlier death than women all across the world - and even in great apes - there's citations of the regular mix of toxic masculinity traits (help seeking behavior, alcohol, risk taking, and drug abuse)  as well as obesity and a higher likelihood to die from ""brawls, car accidents and gun fights"". Yet while testosterone may attempt to explain some of this behavior low testosterone is a killer too in the form of heat disease. Inversely, it may not be men's hormones that cause them to die early but rather women's to cause them to live longer. ""Estrogen appears to be protective - it has been shown to have an anti-oxident role"".

When it comes to lung disease the sexes who smoke don't directly map onto who get's lung disease, even when non-smokers are added in. (24% of women diagnosed did not smoke at all).

2020-03-10 06:21:10,Accounting for Abusers in Our Midst,"Before I get into the meat of this post, I am a gay trans man. I experienced violent sexual abuse before I transitioned and I will be partly speaking from my own experience. Trigger warnings apply. 

I also tend to refer to myself in the feminine prior to medical transition. This is what works for me. Please do not assume all trans folks are okay with this. 


*

It came up earlier on this sub that someone recommended the writings of a man who has been called out by the #metoo movement and had some serious allegations levied against him. 

Before I transitioned, I was in an abusive relationship. I am still in therapy today over some of the abuse I endured and I retain an inherent distrust of straight cis men, especially if they are charming. 

Women with often form word of mouth networks to protect each other from predatory men and abusive men. It is incredibly hard to actually prosecute for sexual violence, although I hope that may change in our lifetime, so women can not afford to take, “He was never convicted in court,” to mean, “He isn’t an abuser.”  

My abuser tended to pick younger, naive women from my college. Once that was figured out, a sort of network sprang up organically, and if he was spotted around campus, one of the older students who knew his history would stick themselves to any of the younger students who might not be aware while letting them know. 

I have seen similar things happen in many spaces - work, festivals, activist movements. The burden falls to the women themselves to protect themselves from these men. (And for this space I would like to focus on men who abuse women or men who abuse men, while recognizing that yes, men can be the victims of abuse, this space is about perpetrators.)

I see a lot of men who don’t even realize they are supporting abusive or predatory men. Before I transitioned, I was a very pretty and attractive woman and I have had more than my share of experience where men did not understand, at all, what their buddy was doing or would even protest that their buddy is a good guy and it can’t be that bad. In terms of famous folks, I assume it’s much worse. 

What are ways that, we as a community of men, can acknowledge the abusers in our midst, the predatory and dangerous men, and rescind the tacit complicity that comes with not recognizing their danger, whether to ourselves or others?",True,895,0.94,268,,/r/MensLib/comments/fg32zt/accounting_for_abusers_in_our_midst/,grayperegrine

I need some advice in setting the group up, however. I need to emphasize that this is not a space for the ""men's rights"" crowd with misogynistic tendencies, but I still want all young men to feel welcome to talk about their experience. How do you folks suggest I best set up an atmosphere with open discussion but clear boundaries (trying especially hard to avoid anti-feminist beliefs)? I also need a good name for the group, and suggestions are welcome. Lastly, what would you have liked or needed when you were in high school, and how can I best provide that?

2020-03-10 10:24:53,Are hyper aggressive role models for men inherently dangerous?,"So, one thing I've noticed among all of this recent talk of anti-toxic masculinity stuff is highlighting the importance of men's feelings/emotions. All well and good, I'm an artist myself and I've always been someone to get wrapped up and involved with emotions and sentimentality, I'm not a tail-chaser but I crave romance and intimacy so would be nice if it didn't feel so fucking awkward/wrong to say to a girl who wants to take me to bed 'yeah I'm not interested in that right now. Can we keep playing scrabble instead of having sex?'

But I've also found that one of my favorite podcasts to listen too is one by this guy named Jocko Willink, a former Navy S.E.A.L who served in Iraq. And I like a lot of the stuff he talks about, and his attitude, but I feel like I'm living some kind of double life, and if all my fellow feminist/anti-toxic men advocates found out about about the respect I have for this guy then they'd cast me out as if I was a harpy.

But I think some of the things he says are valuable:

He spends  great amount of time talking about how valuable physical health is. He gets up at 4 am to work out every day, and while he doesn't tell his listeners to do that he always speaks in praise of people who do the difficult task of working out/learning martial arts. As a man who's spent most of my life being the weakest person in a room I really connect with this.

He does talk a lot about how people should face challenges head on, rather than accepting defeat. He's got this one really cool speech were he says the best response to trouble is to think 'Good.' Ex: 'Oh no I got injured! Good. I get a break from training, I can read more. ' 'Oh no, the deadline is approaching. Good. I have the opportunity to figure this out. Oh no, I didn't get promoted. Good. More time to get better before I'm given more responsibilities' etc.

Also he doesn't shy away from violence, and the simple fact that it is often the necessary solution to problems. I mean he's not arguing for us to go get in bar fights, beat our wives, or enslave other people like colonizers. But he's aware that there are evil people in the world who mean you harm, and this true of a national and personal level.

A guy I know at the gym got fucking shot in the legs like four times because he didn't give up his necklace when he was getting mugged, my brother once had a guy hit him across the face with a tire iron because he didn't like white rednecks, and let's face it: Political groups like Nazis or ISIS aren't really going to respond well to love and tolerance. Would the world be better if all of the above didn't exist, and John Lennon's dream was realized of a brotherhood of humanity. Sure. But here in the real world, the guy who wants to fuck me up in the street needs to be dealt with through violence, and fascists need killin'.

But so much of these pro-men sentiments I see are all 'Don't feel the need to live up to physical male beauty standards, don't feel the need to suppress your emotions, don't think that violence is the answer.'

Well sometimes I like or at least agree with all of the above. Does that make me a bad man for liking role models like this and wanting to be more like them?

EDIT: Some pretty good responses. I think if I were asking this again I would change it from 'Hyper aggressive' to 'assertive.' I think that when I'm discussing the traits that I like and want to cultivate, I'm speaking more about being assertive and prevent harm, rather than going out and looking to cause harm.",True,68,0.89,88,,/r/MensLib/comments/fg6o84/are_hyper_aggressive_role_models_for_men/,Raspint

2020-03-09 06:41:14,What does healthy confidence look like?,"Recently discovered this community. Along with watching a movie called “The Mask you live in”, I’ve realized how much harm I’m doing to myself by trying to adhere to the impossible and toxic image men are taught to mold themselves to.
 
Along these lines, where I grew up, confidence meant being quick to fight, being ready to kill people that wronged you, doing lots of drugs, being disrespectful to and objectifying women openly, and of course not showing any “feminine” emotions. 

While I realize now that these things are wrong, I still find myself slipping back into that mindset from time to time. I want to challenge myself to be more confident, because I am often passive when I don’t want to be, but I often struggle to have an idea of what a confident man without toxicity looks like.

2020-03-09 04:38:51,Soap box on the idea of Mental Loads,"Relatively recently, I (M) came across this [web-comic discussing mental load](https://english.emmaclit.com/2017/05/20/you-shouldve-asked/), and had an ""aha"" moment. I was the protagonist and maintained the mental load of my former marriage.

This led me to pursue a large amount of discussions among several circles of friends, family and colleagues (of various genders, cultures, and orientations) around the idea of the mental load in both non committed relationships and committed relationships and what each partners part was. Here are what several different groups had to say: 

Hetero men of various cultures expressed the following regarding their committed relationships:

* Initiated dating and selecting of a partner.
* Maintained the courtship, suggested when to move in together, and sacrificed individual activities to make it happen
* Planned and executed fun activities for the family to take part in
* Earned a higher salary at a more stressful job
* Initiated physical intimacy and were the ""giver"" in the sexual interactions while not receiving a full gamut of pleasurable experiences
* Played defensive and protective roles in stressful environments and interactions
* Played the ""bad cop"" in child rearing, billing issues, and others
* Modulated their behavior so as to not trigger their SO
* Planned for far off future events and set long term agendas/plans for large changes in living, life, etc.
* Managed billing and finances 
* Pursued additional schooling, business opportunities, or work/financial opportunities to be able to provide more income
* Did all most of the dirty/dangerous jobs such as car maintenance, house repair, etc
* Commuted greater distances for work. Sometimes even working across the state/country for large stretches of time in unfamiliar areas

Hetero women on the other hand: 

* Managed the day to day operations and chores of the household like when cleaning certain things took place, children's toy management, etc.
* Maintained relationships with teachers, children's friends parents, other family members etc
* Prepared and managed the kitchen, laundry, etc and duties surrounding it
* Manged the emotional state of others in the household and offered free therapy to children, etc. 
* Managed daily inventories and stocks of commonly consumed items
* Maintained lists of children's, friend's and family member wants/needs/desires 
* Worked at least part time to offer more financial support (but this was evolving as many women pursed additional employment and many were the bread winner)
* Therapy, drs visits, and other mental/physical health status checks
* Did most of the delicate jobs
* Stylist for herself, children and husband. 

In non heterosexual relationships I generally found a more egalitarian balancing as the discussions were more open and fluid about who was doing what and why during the relationship. However, when certain aspects crept in where one member of the relationship would take on whichever task they were best suited for, generally that task had knock on ramifications where other tasks tended to follow suit along the above gender lines. For instance, one partner was a much better cook and took on 90% of the cooking, kitchen management, dishes, etc as they became defensive of how everything was organized so as to make sure their job was easier. This led to grocery management, household shopping, and household budget management. 

Regarding non committed relationships, I found it interesting that men who lived alone adopted either a lone wolf mentality and did the bare minimum of the stereotypical female areas of mental load (like interpersonal relationship management (besides friends/immediate family), cooking, in depth cleaning, doing delicate household jobs, etc) or they did but to less of a standard as what was typical in single female households. However, one thing became very apparent. Single people (regardless of gender) and people with young children household's are generally in need of routine cleaning and food management. Stereotypically, men ate out and did not cook at all (besides grilling) while women bought ready made meals or easy to cook meals like blue apron. Single women also had the ever present self defense in mind while single men (that were dating) were constantly searching for opportunities to find a suitable match and bemoaning the defensiveness of single women. 


But you see, I think the problem with these discussions are that when someone is frustrated by the current role or situation, they become angry and are not able to articulate how they are managing their share of the mental load and what they are actually doing. People make assumptions based off of things like this webcomic or others and end up doing nothing to change it or build resentments. I know I had tried to have this conversation with my STBXW multiple times, as I was performing both the male and female traits above, and tried to express why I constantly felt so burnt out but because of my baggage and history of abuse I would just lay down and take it. After we separated I sought out therapy and have been able to manage my living space and the other above issues easier. I digress but I believe the conversation surrounding mental load needs to a frequent conversation in any and all relationships both of the intimate kind of the friendship kind (this effects them as well) so as to prevent relationship disfunction and to improve communication among everyone.

Any thoughts, personal experiences/anecdotes, or ideas on looking at the reported aspects of mental loads and how to assign weighted values to them that transcend gender would appreciated!

2020-03-09 07:23:59,"It’s Just Love, Baby; Or, How Polyamory has made me re-examine Men and their Relationships","Hello all you beautiful people!

So over the past few months, after a rough breakup and starting some much needed therapy, I’ve slowly been rethinking my approach to romantic relationships, specifically exploring Ethical Nonmonogamy (re: ENM), and how men today are expected to act in relationships and how we can think about how we can act in healthier ways in relationships.

I started seeing this coworker (soon to be ex-coworker. No worries though, she’s being transferred to a different section for harmless reasons!) who went through her own reexamination of herself following a breakup about a year ago, and has been exploring ENM as a form of self-actualization, and self-confidence that she doesn’t need a singular partner for validation of her own self, she wants to simply be able to enjoy dating other people!

And for me, she’s sort of the first serious step I’ve taken towards ENM (or polyamory, the terminology is still fairly new to me right now). And I’ve come to realize that I think I have the capacity and have the desire to love more than one person, and it’s made me think about how this is so contrary to how society dictates the role that I should play in relationships.

Men, in a lot of ways, are ‘expected’ to not only be aggressors and go-getters in relationships, but as I like to think of it, ‘conquerors’. That they must be brash and take what they deserve (this case being women) and not share those resources or prizes that they have won. And consequently, women are simply seen as prizes and things to be won, rather than the whole people that they are.

What Polyamory has slowly turned me around to is an alternative way of thinking about relationships, that it’s not a competition to fight and keep that partner or their (eventually, maybe?) love. That I enjoy my time with her and we really connect, but that that’s because we both choose it and desire it, and that we are involved in this as equals. And that at least for me, if and when I decide to start a relationship with someone else, because of how the relationship between me and this coworker is on equal standing, me going for someone else isn’t me losing out on any ‘prize’ or failing my duties as a man. It’s simply because we choose that, and that in the same way a friendship doesn’t detract from my relationship with my family, one romantic relationship isn’t going to subtract my love for another person.

This isn’t to say either that monogamy is incapable of this either! What is the case though is that our society is heavily hetero-mono-normative. That is to say, people are expected to be in straight, monogamous relationships, just with all the extra societal pressures attached to it instead of it simply allowed to be an agreement between equals. Healthy, monogamous relationships absolutely do exist, but they face the same strain of expectations that polyamorous relationships do (and that poly relationships are much less commonly socially acceptable!).

I’m still working through my thoughts on this and how it relates to masculinity and being a man, because that’s what I’m trying to focus this on, rather than the validity of poly vs monogamous relationships in the first place (because as we all know, as long as everybody consents and is informed, both are equally valid!)",True,47,0.73,41,,/r/MensLib/comments/ffl7d2/its_just_love_baby_or_how_polyamory_has_made_me/,mandolin6648
2020-03-09 10:34:53,Advice on starting a new men's circle would be tremendously appreciated.,"So I've been a member of a men's circle for about four years, and it's made a tremendous difference in my life. This group has helped me see how men of different backgrounds deal with problems we all face: depression, grief, worthlessness, anger, rage, lust, envy, loneliness, addiction, etc. The level of trust is profound. I'm so grateful to be a part of a group which accepts me unconditionally. While I dislike using *brother* without blood relation, these men have become comrades. I've helped many of them outside the group, and I've leaned on them when [tragedy struck twelve](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG-8uZg2uV0).

But there's a problem: this circle was started over thirty years ago. Most of the members are 65-75. It's a healthy group, with a mean of ten at each meeting. We're visited by one or two new members who are thirty or under at least every other week. Fewer than 10% come back. I suspect two factors are at play: 1) it's an older crowd 2) some elements are corny: a spiritual/faux-Amerindian invocation & close, chanting, and singing campfire songs. I will admit, both of irritate me sometimes, especially the latter. I'm not aware of other groups like this in town, especially for men who are 25-55. I'm considering beginning my own later this year.

I do not like being a figurehead. I'm good at planning, organizing, and design. I will [step in if no one else qualified wants to](https://invidio.us/watch?v=HzA6KiYiwo0), but I prefer to be an architect behind the scenes solving problems than a politician taking credit at the ribbon cutting ceremony. I'm also exhausted by excess email, text, and phone conversations with acquaintances. However, I think I'd have the support of the current circle if I created a new one (a regular member started another group for retirees).

I reckon it's worth trying. **This is my plan based on what I've learned**:

* 2 engraved talking sticks: current and next speaker.

* A board with knickknacks (rocks/feathers/peace pipe/beads/meditation bell)

* [5 candles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XchwE9zVdnw): one in the center as well as each corner

* A singing bowl to commence & end the opening meditation

* Radical freedom: all that is required, aside from being male, is to show up and sit down

* Ten minute silent meditation/grounding/prayer, with a sign on the door telling latecomers to wait

* Going around the circle to check-in. Going around the circle to check-out. Each time someone speaks, he first takes the stick and says his name.

* Someone who wants feedback is encouraged to say so once when he's finished talking. If he doesn't do this, the following speakers must ask permission first.

* Having a restroom nearby

* Having blankets, heavy socks, and heaters/hand warmers on hand when it's cold outside

* Being consistent with the meeting time and place: start on time, end on time.

* Avoiding days+times when similar groups meet.

* A distributable email/call sheet (updated monthly) of members are available to be contacted for support outside the group

* Offering *optional* activities outside the group for cohesion: volunteering, potlucks/bashes, book club, nature walks/camping

* Asking for help. It'd be foolish to try and manage a group alone.

**What I want to avoid**:

* Religion, Politics, Abuse/accusations

* Prayers, recitals, singing/dancing/drumming, hokey mumbo jumbo

* Food. But it's OK to bring a beverage with a lid, and coffee/tea will be available on a nearby table.

**Help I would like from anyone reading (including women)**:

1. Your suggestions on what does and doesn't work.

2. Books & resources you've revisited on this subject

3. Whether or not any of this sounds foolish.

The consequences of sexual abuse in my life were deep and destructive in many ways.

Recently, I decided to face that, and deal with all the fear, shame, insecurities, distrust, loneliness and even with some compulsive behaviors that was generated my childhood experience.

I know it is difficult to deal with that. 

I know it is painful - It was when it happened and it is now.

2020-03-08 08:20:10,Healthy support for circumcision emotions,"Hi. I know this is a divisive issue, but I need help. 

I have very intense anger and depression surrounding my childhood circumcision. I have occasional flashbacks and body memories,  symptoms of PTSD, and have had significant body image issues and relationship problems (I've had one relationship, ever, and though this issue wasn't what broke us up, it complicated it). The sex I've had was pleasurable inasmuch as I gave my partner pleasure, but I often couldn't function or orgasm, and simply didn't really feel much of anything except when I did manage to orgasm (with effort - it just felt like work). I'm angry that I'll never have a normal, healthy sex life.  I can't overstate how much this has affected my well-being. 

I  really need support right now to keep the self-harming thoughts at bay. I'm concerned though, looking for example at what happened to the original ""incel"" community - it seems like when a support forum isn't well-moderated, people tend to reinforce each other's most toxic and negative feelings and things go downhill. There's a reason in-person support groups are often run by therapists. 

I guess I'm wondering if there are any well-moderated support communities that exist on this subject?

2020-03-06 12:06:46,Why can’t a trans man be feminine?,"I’m a trans man and though I live in a state where trans people are respected, I often find that most people believe that trans men are always masculine and trans women are always feminine, which isn’t true, but when they meet someone outside that belief they sometimes call the person’s identity into question. 

I’m a trans man who’s also gay and I love to paint my nails in a large variety of colors, I wear bright clothes and sometimes crop tops and am a Soft Boy. So I’m pretty much your typical gay twink femboy. 
I pass 99.9% and the only time I have issues with passing is over the phone calls and legal stuff which I jus casually correct them that I’m a trans guy and all that jazz. 

I just want to know where this weird thing came from? I understand that most fresh out of the closet trans people are more intense and are overly masc ftm or overly fem mtf but tone down  and their gender expression changes later once they feel they pass enough.


Edit: If I came off offensive, forgive me as that was not my intention. I know Gender and Gender Expression are different and regardless of gender anyone can be masc, fem or androgynous.

2020-03-06 04:54:22,The Many Lost and Misguided Men and the Dark Places They Often Turn to,"I found out about this particular subreddit today and the emotions it invoked were incredible.

Earlier today, I read a post from a man speaking about the personal dilemma he faced when confronted by his wife about what was perceived to be harmful male traits. I was brought to tears when I saw the extremely empathetic and informative responses that followed - but those few tears multiplied as I remembered all the other men out there feeling the same and uncertain of why or where they can healthily express themselves. 

Unfortunately, many of those men get mixed up in the wrong crowds that often weaponize their feelings and insecurites and convert them into anger, hatred, and bitterness. This particular man, however, seemed to have stumbled upon the right group that not only understood his pain, but offered helpful alternatives to come to a reasonable conclusion.

It hit home for me, mainly because I also once shared the same feelings he did but with no understanding of why (and am still learning to this day). I, just like many other men, then felt strange, lost, confused, etc. and turned to the internet for similar experiences. Alas, the first things you often see tend to be all of the wrong paths to take. I landed on posts from men who spoke about how they feel, but also loaded it with the idea that women (or other related groups that may've wronged them) are generally to blame for all of their problems. At the time, I didn't understand much about feminism, men's rights, or politics in general, but I did feel connected to those other men who seemed to share similar feelings and experiences. This connection brought me to extremely dark places (and, regrettably, the same happens to many other men).

In the end, I wanted to express my happiness that a subreddit like this exists that serves to give men an opportunity to express themselves positively and better understand the things even they probably never knew or understood about themselves. I also wanted to show the immense amount of empathy I feel for those men who unknowingly get involved in the wrong groups (and eventually get pulled into a seemingly inescapable abyss of hatred for women and everything alike).

I'm fortunate to be able to continue moving forward from these (often miserable) spaces, but when a harmful mentality consumes you, it's usually very difficult to break away from it.

2020-03-06 02:46:17,How do we stop treating ourselves as disposable?,"A couple weeks ago I had this conversation in a general discussion subreddit (one of the AskX, for context) where we were discussing gender dynamics in survival situations. 

The primary example we used for our thought experiments was a sinking ship with a boat in which there was only one place remaining, and we were weighting the life of a man versus a woman. 

During this conversation, another user insisted that if I decided to save my own life instead of giving my place to a woman with whom I had no connections, I would be a coward, yet somehow he said that he didn't think I had an obligation to do so, but not doing wo would be cowardice. 

The debate went on for quite long and somehow the other user was unable to conceive that a man would put his own life above the life of a woman, to the extent he seemed to think I was trolling. 

There is a lot of pressure put on us by society and by ourselves to treat ourselves as sacrificiable if somebody else, a woman or a child, is in danger. It is actually expected from us to do that, to the point that not doing it is considered a moral flaw. 

I've found myself doing that. I go on night bicycle rides once a week, and a couple times when I ride along with a woman, I almost instinctively position myself in a way that any potential incoming car would hit me first and she would be protected. 

And even in less pressing situations, there are a lot of moments when men are expected to put themselves through discomfort just so other members of society don't have to (the simplest example is giving up a seat in a crowded bus to a woman, simply for being a man and because she is a woman)

And, in a lot of times, these expectations are enforced by other men just as much or more as by women. 

So... do you think it's right that we should treat ourselves as if our comfort, physical integrity and lives are more sacrificiable than those of the rest of society? And if not, how can we stop doing that?

As a note: I am aware that there are other situations where the opposit expectations are into play and society coddles men for certain circumstances, but that doesnt invalidate the first part of my post.

Feminism in Japan is unfortunately still predominantly seen as angry women's voice. There is almost no information on men being feminist, or how to be supportive and inclusive to others as (particularly cis) men.

2020-03-04 19:11:10,"Boys Need Cuddles Too: Early Childhood Experiences, Infant Development and Masculinity.","The more I learn on my child development and psychoanalysis course the more I am convinced that much of a person’s chances of living a happy life depend on early childhood experiences. Research such as the papers I’ll link below seem to say that children who develop well attached relationships in early life live longer happier lives. It makes me curious as to the effect this has on masculinity. There’s research to show infants perceived to be boys are treated with less tenderness, and described as less social and more aggressive. This despite evidence that show infant boys experience more stress (or at least their cortisol levels spike higher and faster than girl’s) and take longer to develop self-soothing defence mechanisms against stress (such as thumb sucking, or turning away). The usual caveats about gender essentialism apply, every baby is different, it represents a general trend etc. But seeing how much boys, especially white lower-class boys, are being left behind in school makes me wonder if we should pay more attention to the way babies are raised and the culture around raising young children. I’m curious as to what you menslibbers think about this.

2020-03-04 09:37:53,On sex between trans and cis men: questions & ponderings,"I’m a trans guy and have recently been delving into sex with men (cis and trans). I’ve noticed a few things and welcome comments or dialogue about this. Feel free to point me to threads already started on it. 

Some of the most intense transphobia I’ve experienced has come from white cis gay men. I’ve felt disheartened and confused about this, but I think I partially understand the underpinnings and fears/discomforts. 

I recently moved to a more conservative city than where I was just living (from coastal BC, to Southern interior BC, Canada), so I have been apprehensive about seeing what sleeping with or dating cis men would be like. However, I had an amazing experience with a cis gay guy from India recently and felt validated and hopeful. 

Some things I’ve noticed (as a white trans guy):
- I’ve been primarily hit on/pursued by black and brown men of varying social classes
- white cis men seem more intensely transphobic or rude on gay dating apps
- some people are really afraid of vaginas / front holes; I have no issue with people not liking this body part or any other, but there can be like a fervent intense fear or disgust from some people

Questions: 
- What are your communities like around sex and  relationships between cis and trans queer / gay etc men? 
- Do you notice any cultural etc differences?
- Do you think there are any specific things that help your community (or could help) it become safer and more open?

*edit: I’m not saying it’s transphobic to not be into a trans man if he doesn’t have a type of penis you prefer, I am meaning transphobia like purposely misgendering, belittling, saying “you’re not a real man if you’re trans” and the like. I have no issue with people’s preferences, just be kind.

*edit: thanks for everyone’s responses. I’m honestly most interested in sociocultural and geographical stuff, and how we can be more inclusive and kind to one another. I wonder what makes one community safer and another more transphobic, and how to move out of / through this. It’s not a quest of making more people sleep with me, I’m fine in that area, but about making things safer in general for more folks.",True,717,0.93,178,,/r/MensLib/comments/fd5exm/on_sex_between_trans_and_cis_men_questions/,arr0wrooted

I went to a dance social the other day and it felt like the polar opposite mood from online dating.  I walked in uncomfortable because - well, dance is hard and I'm not good at it yet, but several different women asked me to dance (!).  I felt like the world.  I had a great conversation with someone I'd never met who was a total joy to talk to.    

For that period of time it felt like I had nothing to prove, like it wasn't about what I could do, but rather just the sensation of people enjoying my company.  Like I was valued for my appearance/presence, or that at the least these were Enough without buying anyone anything.  A far cry from swiping endless profiles in an empty void.  Women were \*happy\* when I asked them to dance.   No second-guessing about word choice or lines.  Just like that.  No expectations.  Enjoying ourselves.   

I started going to the gym, dressing better, and getting into fragrances because I thought it would get me dates; I can tell it's made a difference in how I come off, but online dating doesn't feel much more successful or less lonely.  

But I found that I really enjoy these for their own sake.

2020-03-03 02:24:50,Misandry in culture: Are men capable of caring about women's issues without secretly seeking to bang them?,"Greetings, brothers. 

I've noticed a trend that is increasingly getting on my nerves. It's something I think most people here can relate to, given the current state of internet discourse regarding gender, identity and all that stuff. 

I'm talking about this false idea that you, as a man, are only motivated by sex when dealing with women. That your politics, behavior, morality etc. are all ""not real"" or genuine, but apparently part of some elaborate plot to impress women. 

That if a man calls out misogyny from other men, then he must be some 'white knight' trying to get laid. That if a man is a feminist or advocates for women's rights in other ways, he is somehow less of a man and loses magical masculinity points. 

These are, in my view, incredibly misandrist attitudes, and it saddens me to say that a lot of people in society are unfortunately ok with this. Now, I would love to tell you that these attitudes are merely the psychological projection of misogynists, but unfortunately this line of thinking is also present among some feminist women.  

As revolutionary as it may sound, it's perfectly possible to advocate for the rights of people without wanting anything in return. It's perfectly possible to genuinely care about the plight of a group without being part of that group yourself. Nor do you compromise your masculinity when dedicating time and effort into fighting for the rights of said groups.

e.g. Does standing up for LGBT people mean you secretly wish to bang them or impress them for favors? And is advocacy for the rights of the Rohingya people or the Kurds not genuine if the advocacy is coming from someone who isn't part of said ethnic groups? Does animal rights advocacy make you a sheep-shagging bastard? etc. etc. 

The answer to all these questions is obviously no, unless you're devoid of reason. Likewise, it's possible for a man to genuinely care about women's issues despite not being a woman himself. Man may be a sexual creature, but he is also a moral one. 

What do you guys think about this cultural attitude? What are you experiences? Are you afraid of speaking up for women's rights or calling yourself a male feminist because of these attitudes?",True,1591,0.95,308,,/r/MensLib/comments/fcgewl/misandry_in_culture_are_men_capable_of_caring/,MandrakeThePancake
2020-03-03 23:23:38,"Dear ""Not all men"", or how to face culpability of being an oppressor - the case of the mental load","Hi there. I just discovered this sub yesterday, and I'm very happy to find such a place I've been looking for a long time.  


My first post is about how to face, as a man, the ""not all men"" automatic response we can give when someone (generally a woman) points out some of our toxic behavior as a man against women. I think it's the biggest issue I'm facing in my deconstruction process as it really hurts my GF (cis man here) and it really messes our couple up. My thoughts are a bit messy while writing this so I'll start by a bit of background in which you may or may not identify. After that I will sum up an article providing some help.  


English is not my native language so sorry for any mistake I could write...  


So we live together since a few years, we both work at home most of the time, and our main source of conflict is that I cannot face the fact that her mental load is way above mine. I mean I can face it but most of the time the wrong way, especially when it comes to chores. When she's out of patience and becomes angry against me because I did not \[insert some chores here\], I just cannot react like ""yes you're right, again, sorry I'll fix it and try to do my best then"". We spoke a LOT about mental load, and I know it should be the appropriate answer (at least for her),  but in place of that I get upset and I need to highlight what I  actually did and she did not see, and explain why I did not this or that  or maybe I planned to do it later or why we should do that or this in  another way.  
When a crisis happens, I try to  say to myself what I just described in order to react appropriately but  most of the time it just doesn't work and I just keep getting more upset  and angry because at this very moment I'm basically 100% sure that  she's exaggerating and overstating things. Which of course makes things getting worse.  She has a very solid feminist culture and can handle her anger very  well, so she has no problem to throw to my face the whole arguments  about how typical this situation is in terms of toxic masculinity and  privileges. After that I feel like she puts on me the responsibility of a whole social group and totally forget about me as an individual, which feels unfair to me because I cannot annihilate Patriarchy by myself. I know this is all biased by my anger on the moment, but this is precisely what I fell in these moments.  
During our discussion (the calm ones, not when angry) I even came to the point that in our life as a couple, I will always be the one that will receive reproaches as I will always be the faulty person because of my privilege of being a man, whatever amount of effort I can put in deconstructing my privileges (those are so sticky!). Which feels like a permanent kick in the stomach.  
Another argument I cannot deal with is that the efforts I put in my deconstruction process and correcting my behaviour (and thus maintaining our couple healthy) are far less important than she does for herself (thus ourself). I agree with that but I sadly cannot answer positively to that. Feminism has a huge place in her life: it's certainly what helped her to surmount many obstacles in her life, it's central in her daily work and her discussions with her friends. This is not the case for me and I don't want it to be. I mean I admire who she is and what she does but I don't want to ""tint"" my life with feminism to that extent. Of course when you begin a deconstruction process it spreads in your whole life, but with a different gradient depending on the time you spend on it. Adding to that the fact that she began this process earlier than me and that she's older than me, I will never be able make up for lost time and I'll always be ""behind"" her in terms of efforts. I see no solution or compromise there, it's like we'll never get to a stability point.  


Enough of white cis man tears, here is the interesting stuff:  


The day after one of the crises as described above, she sent me an [article](https://jesuisfeministe.com/2017/10/26/lettre-ouverte-aux-not-all-men/) (she reads literally hundreds of those) called ""Open letter to 'not all men'"". It's in French but here is a recap: 

* the ""not all men"" phenomenon comes from feeling guilty of patriarchy, whatever you are a man (even if your machismo is to its lowest) or a woman (which could feel guilty of making a man feeling guilty of its toxicity)
*  Guilt, which comes with shame, is very poorly handled by men (resulting to misplaced anger I guess, at least in my case) and is very ""familiar"" to women who can easily feel guilty of being a victim
*  guilt and shame are very powerful and toxic tools coming from the dogmatic Judeo-Christian culture, where mistakes, errors, defaults become faults or even sins
*  Feminism is not a judging court (as we might think it is in some cases because of the said inherited Judaeo-Christian culture) and is more about responsibility than guilt
*  Responsibility is heavy, especially when it comes to patriarchy, but it's also an ability to change things, a potential of actions, in which mistakes and fallibility are accepted
*  as a man you necessarily embody patriarchy, whatever your behaviour is, whether you like it or not
*  instead of feeling guilty (resulting in shame, and/or anger in my case), men should take a better sens of what responsibility is.

Intersting huh ?  


I  agree with all these summed up points, and since way before reading  this article, but in practice I obviously cannot apply the lesson, even  if I try for years. In the meantime I try hard to keep away the idea that this relation could be an impasse, because since the beginning it's not: I, we evolve, we move on, some progress is done. But I cannot get rid of the kind of situation described above. I/we tried many things (therapy, talking with friends, reading and watching stuff about it, chore planning...) but results are thin. I know it has to do with the way I handle my emotions (I'm the kind of hyper-emotive-who-tend-to-overthink-everything-to-keep-emotions-away guy) which has to do with how I connect to my body (spoiler: very poorly, spend most of my time on my desk, do very little physical effort, but keep attached to my appearance), which are things I'm working on too.  


So here are my questions:  
Once you theoretically get the point, what can help you actually take your responsibility and not act as a jerk?  
How do you do to get rid of this Judeo-Christian heritage?


**EDIT:** thanks for your answers, I'll try to answer back more precisely to each of you, but as 3 of 4 comment says I'm being abused in this relationship (thanks, you made me dig a lot in here), i think that a bit more of context should be appropriate. 
So yes she starts the fights because she puts the problems on the table. She becomes angry because she runs out of patience because I in a way, abuse of her by not taking my responsibilities. At least not enough for her to feel released. And I guess she's right to blame me for this.
To me, patriarchy is not just about small groups of men owning power (to me this is more the definition of what capitalism is, which is part of patriarchy). It's a widespread system whose values are inherited by everyone. Of course I'm less responsible than others, but it would be an error to say I'm not part of them. Otherwise it's like saying ""I'm not racist"" as a white person. We all reproduce oppressions, in different ways and to different levels, but we can't get rid of those, even kindest and most comprehensive of us. All we can do is just to take our responsibility for the toxic part of us we struggle to fight against, especially when these toxic parts are linked to a privilege. At some point it always hurts your ego to fight against one of your privileges. And I think this is the problem I'm facing. But please tell me if you still think I'm wrong.
These fights are not the only part of our relationship. She turns out to be very supportive, patient and instructive about these issues, and that represents an additional mental load she has to cary to keep our relationship healthy as long as I don't take my own responsibilities. Which is another reason for her to become angry at some point, and I can understand that.
We are also starting to plan a bit of our future, including a child and buying a house, and she's afraid that the mental load issues we're facing take even more place in this future, because taking care of a child and a buying a house are a lot of mental load. And once again I cannot blame her for this fear. Because obviously right now I spend less time than she does in looking for information to prepare all of this. I'm less autonomous an pro-active than she is. I'm working on it, but I cannot face most conflicts it can raise when I'm doing it wrong, and that's why I wrote this post first.

This article is over two years old, but its still an interesting read and I found myself coming back to it the other day. I think one section is rather telling. 

One of the writers reflects on how social work is a very female heavy field, and how he noticed what he perceived to be a startling lack of empathy from coworkers when interacting with men who exhibited angry or violent behavior. 

Obviously there is no excuse for violence and we should offer no excuses for such behavior. However, anger is completely different. Anger is a normal emotion that everyone experiences, especially at the low points of their lives. Its troubling to think that men who are the most vulnerable, in need of social services by trained professionals, might have their problems or emotions dismissed or even condemned by the very people they turn to for help.

2020-03-02 13:55:31,My Bystander Intervention Course,"I'm a part time student taking a class for a pre-req I need. Enrollment at this school also means I needed to take a short (maybe an hour) Bystander Intervention course (centered mostly on sexual and relationship violence) and it made me realize a couple of things.

First, that I may have been in an abusive relationship. Many of the things it notes as examples of controlling, emotionally abusive behavior were present in my last (serious) relationship. She more than once accused me of cheating because my depression was causing my sex drive to completely disappear. By her logic, she was beautiful (true) and therefore if I didn't want to have sex with her I must have been having sex with someone else (untrue). She also texted to check in on me constantly and had near breakdowns when I didn't respond quickly.

Eventually the relationship fell apart and when it did, she told everyone that I had been abusive (her family, friends, etc). She even went as far as to tell her family that I was dangerous. I'm a gun owner and because her dad had a secure ""armory"" I kept my guns there. When I picked them up, her mom contacted mine telling her that they feared for their daughter's safety, afraid that I'd hurt or kill her with the guns (something I have no history of and had never indicated I had any interest in doing). It's caused me a lot of insecurity and anxiety and has made the short relationships I engaged in afterward very hard.

I don't really know what to do with this information, as I already see a therapist and it doesn't really seem to be getting better.

Second, I realized I might be prone to some of the things the training talked about myself. Specifically, I'm a very jealous person and I find it extremely difficult to trust women I'm dating. I don't want to be prone to abusive behaviors and while I don't think I exhibited them in that relationship, I'm afraid that I might in future relationships. How do I train myself to trust people? I'm asking specifically about romantic relationships but I notice this kind of trust problem in my friendships as well. I always feel insecure about people talking behind my back.

2020-03-01 18:20:48,1917 and male pain,"Bear with me, I'm going to talk about women for a bit, but please keep reading as the relevance to this sub will eventually become clear!

I'm a woman, and the last few years, as my eyes have become opened to patriarchy, and the oppression and suffering of women down the centuries, I've been feeling the weight of a sort of collective female pain, passed down through generations.

In addition to the continuing suffering inflicted upon women today – in the form of oppression, sexual abuse, discrimination and so on – we also carry the weight of women's mistreatment throughout history. It affects how we conduct ourselves, even today. It means we can struggle to assert ourselves in conflict situations, and it means we move through the world fearful of assault. It means we devalue our own capabilities when applying for jobs and it means we unquestioningly take on the majority of emotional labour in relationships.

These traits are passed down from mother to daughter, down the centuries, meaning that historical oppression (as well as current oppression) still negatively affects women today.

Anyway this is something I've thought about a lot as a woman. 

I've always been strongly aware that there is an equivalent male pain that exists, but yesterday I went to see the film 1917 and it brought home the concept of male pain more forcefully than ever before. So I just wanted to take a moment to acknowledge, and honour, male pain.

For those of you haven't seen the movie, it's a film about the first world war. The suffering portrayed is unrelenting, and heartbreaking. You get a real sense of the disposability of men's lives, how no-one cared about them, how they suffered unimaginably, and for no reason. It's an extremely difficult film to watch. The destruction is devastating.

It made me think about how, throughout history, men in particular have been expected to walk into violent situations unquestioningly, no matter how sensitive or peaceful an individual they may be at heart. Men have been taught they should be willing to die for their family. They've been taught that suffering and inflicting mortal pain is more important, more valued, than connecting empathetically with others. More important than having individual hopes and dreams. 

And the whole concept of going away to war being the right thing to do, to protect your family, rather than actually being there for them in person – it's reflected today in the way that many men work themselves to the bone, in toxic work environments, ""for the sake of their families"", rather than actually being there.

I have no doubt that almost all manifestations of toxic masculinity that we see today have their roots in this collective, historical pain and suffering.

I realise I'm speaking in generalisations of course. Women also suffer in war. And the problematic behaviours I've alluded to above – in reference to both men and women – are of course not exclusive to either gender. So I hope I haven't caused anyone any offence with these observations.

Once again, I want to emphasise that none of this is news to me. As a feminist I believe it's my duty to consider how patriarchy has damaged both men and women. But the film shook me to my core, and it just seemed an opportune moment to say something I've been thinking for a while, which is this:

Men, I see you. I see the pain you have suffered and the sacrifices you have made. I see the way your lives have been treated as meaningless, disposable, the way that you have been seen – throughout history – as cannon fodder, mere numbers, pawns in a game played by more powerful men. 

I see the way you suffer today, from the weight of social expectation on you. From the way you are expected to always be strong, to suffer silently, to support those around you. I see the way you die by suicide, in large numbers, from pain unseen and unacknowledged. I see the way the more damaged among you lash out and inflict further suffering on the men and women around you. I see how you struggle with the knowledge of your own privilege, as males, whilst also dealing with the very real disadvantages inflicted on you, in the form of poverty, or illness, or struggles with gender identity or sexual orientation.

I want you to know that this woman sees you, and appreciates you, and wishes you well.

I love this sub. You guys are all great dudes and I love you. Sending you a big hug!

TL;DR I went to see 1917 last night and my heart just broke for all the men.

Edit 3: Someone called me out – quite rightly – on my use of the word ""sacrifice"". I just want to say that I completely agree with what the commenter said, which is that what happened during WWI was not sacrifice, which implies willingness, but slavery.

Edit 4: Just removing edits 1 and 2 which were just me whining about not being able to see some comments that turned out to be awaiting approval

UPDATE: 

I'm blown away by the response to this post. Thank you to everyone who has responded – it's been great to see some really interesting discussions. I've been reading all the comments and learning a lot.

There are still a few comments that I've been turning over in my head and intend to reply to asap. Some of you have really poured your hearts out on the page and I want to make sure as many people as possible get a reply. 

Thank you to everyone who has given me an award. I'm really touched and really shocked. I've said it before but you're all great people.

Guys, people care about you, I promise. Please talk to the women in your life. Even if you've been stung before, I promise it is worth it. Being vulnerable IS hard, for everyone, but it is rewarding to. And don't forget about all the support available across Reddit, including in this sub.

2020-03-01 22:46:27,Navigating life as a feminine cis straight man,"I've been struggling quite a bit to better accept the fact that I tend to present in a more feminine way.  By this I mean that I've been told that I have more feminine mannerisms, intonations,  a cleaner/well kept appearance, and can be more submissive in regards to romantic relationships.   I don't think that these traits are intrinsically bad, but I do have issues regarding feeling comfortable being myself since I find myself often mislabeled with regards to orientation and have had issues in dating since these don't seem like desirable traits.  As a result, I feel an urge to try to change these qualities at times to better fit the expected behavior of a man.  I know that this is not a healthy way of approaching the situation, but the feeling is there.  I also know that no one truly measures up to the societal ideal of manliness, it's just that I seem to be particularly distant.  

I'm generally pretty proud of where I am in life.  I've accumulated a supportive friend network, have a good job, take care of my health/appearance, and pursue a variety of hobbies (art, philosophy, burlesque).  So in some ways you could even say that I embrace this part of myself.  My issue tends to be with seeking romantic relationships since my perception is that  expressing myself in a more feminine way  and being open about my feelings seem to make me less desirable.  It can often lead to a deeper depression as I struggle to see myself as having power in the situation.  Even though I'm 30, I should say that I don't have as much experience in this realm as many people since I was fairly religious up until I was 23.  I've had two serious relationships and really only one that was somewhat fulfilling/accepting.  I keep flipping back and forth between feeling like I bring a lot to the table and that it doesn't matter since I have seemingly unchangeable qualities that put me outside the norm.  Unfortunately, a lot of my research and anecdotal evidence seem to back up my views.  In fact, part of the impetus for this post was having recently been rejected by someone with whom I was feeling a strong attraction specifically due to my feminine qualities.  I was genuinely surprised when they initially reciprocated interest and was hopeful that the relationship could have served as a miniscule amount of counter-evidence, but so it goes.

Has anyone else successfully navigated this sort of situation?  I feel so lost and only have a vague notion of fleeing Indiana as a remedy.  As I said, this is part of a thought process that often leads to depression and so I'm trying to reframe this in a way that is more hopeful.  I'm generally the kind of person who puts in a lot of work to be someone I am proud of, but I feel like this may be insurmountable.  Any feedback would be appreciated.

TLDR feel like my more pronounced femininity puts me at odds with the kind of people I'm interested in dating and not sure what to do.",True,99,0.99,35,,/r/MensLib/comments/fbuzbm/navigating_life_as_a_feminine_cis_straight_man/,pistaciosis

2020-03-01 01:34:40,The double standard regarding critiquing sexual performance.,"I saw on Twitter today that #SexAdviceForYourPartner was trending, so I opened it up expecting to see people of whatever gender lightly ribbing their partners on what they could be doing better. What I actually saw was 100% sex advice for men on what they're doing wrong, and nothing in the other direction. While I'm sure the advice was completely warranted, it struck me how one directional everything was.

It's not an entirely new thing I've noticed, but there just seems to be this double standard where we recognize that women have unique sexual needs and that most men have learned about sex from porn and therefore get a lot wrong, but men are essentially all the same and have the simplest sexual needs that require no further understanding. 

If you are a man, maybe you have experienced this in your relationship. Your significant other may explain to you what you could do better and it's well received, but trying to explain to them what they're getting wrong, even in the kindest terms results in tears, accusations, and just generally is off limits. This is most definitely not universal but I'm sure people can relate.

Am I totally off here? Can you personally relate to what I'm talking about? I'd love to discuss.",True,245,0.94,70,,/r/MensLib/comments/fbfxj8/the_double_standard_regarding_critiquing_sexual/,YesThisIsSam
2020-03-01 04:16:58,What do you think the future of masculinity looks like?,"Hi everyone, this is German from the Modern Manhood podcast (modernmanhood.org). I'm lucky to be recording my 100th episode coming up soon here (whoo hoo) and I really owe a lot to the MensLib community here.
