2020-08-01 05:43:28,"We shouldn't be teaching young male kids not to rape women, we should be holding both genders at equal responsibility by teaching both genders that rape is wrong and by teaching young women about the cause of rape and how they can avoid being raped.","So, recently I found myself arguing with a girl in my class about a particular statement she made on her Instagram, she said that we should be teaching all young males not to rape and we shouldn't be blaming women at all.
I very strongly disagree with this because it's very fucking hypocritical for the lack of a better term 
Men and women don't rape people, rapists rape people. we shouldn't be telling all kids not to rape and exposing them to that at a young age. The reason is that rapists aren't exactly mentally sane, obviously rape is the worst thing imaginable so the people who perform rape aren't like the rest of us they don't understand logic. If you tell a rapist ""hey, it's not nice to rape stop doing it"" he or she will still rape because they aren't mentally sane.
Instead of targeting young males, we should be teaching young kids of both genders that rape is wrong. We should be also teaching young females that excessively showing skin in public, going out late at night alone, and getting blind drunk in pubs increases their changes of being raped.
I think people should be able to wear what they want but, unfortunately our society is full of rapists,  murderers, and mentally insane people.
Think of it logically, if men and women dress responsibility in public and don't go to sketchy areas alone in the dark, rape cases would dwindle because the rapists won't attack them. Rapists are weak people they won't attack someone in public.
I also think that if someone wants to wear what they want, they should so it in a safe place with people they trust.",1.0,1.0,1.0,30.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i1g8y6/we_shouldnt_be_teaching_young_male_kids_not_to/,sukablieataa

This isn't the first time this sort of thing happened, it's always been going on and many people of both genders have been betrayed by the justice system because justice systems would rather appear tolerant over chase justice.

2020-08-01 14:11:45,Modern Slavery report recommended better support services for men and boys.,"[The report can be found here.](http://www.respect.international/murky-waters-a-qualitative-assessment-of-modern-slavery-in-the-pacific-region/) 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; KEY RECOMMENDATIONS   
&gt;  
&gt;Coordination and cooperation at both the national and regional level are vital for a successful response to modern slavery, more so in resource constrained environments. Walk Free make the following recommendations not only to Pacific governments, which play a pivotal role in developing and implementing legislation and policy, directing funding, and putting priority issues on the agenda, but also to development partners who have the ability to build capacity in the region, civil society with expertise in operating in the Pacific context, and to faith, business, and community leaders who work in, and are part of, the communities within the Pacific.   
&gt;  
&gt;Fund and establish evidence-based and culturally specific awareness raising campaigns around how to identify and report cases of modern slavery, key vulnerability factors, and available support services in local languages.  
&gt;  
&gt;Provide comprehensive and systematic training on victim identification and victim-centred responses to those who may come into contact with victims, and support existing legislation by establishing training programs on laws and regulations that are meant to eliminate modern slavery.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Increase access and strengthen victim support services. Provide emergency care and long-term reintegration support to all victims of modern slavery, including men and migrant workers.** Build upon existing systems where suitable, such as services for victims of gender-based violence.  
&gt;  
&gt;Enact legislation, or strengthen existing legislation, to ensure that all forms of human exploitation are criminalised and penalties for crimes associated with modern slavery are appropriate to the severity of the crime.  
&gt;  
&gt;Develop National Action Plans to combat modern slavery, in coordination with relevant stakeholders, that are based on research and data on the nature and trends of human trafficking and child exploitation. This includes involving the private sector in the national response to modern slavery.  
&gt;  
&gt;Modern slavery extends beyond national borders. Pacific governments must implement a coordinated and focused regional response to successfully combat these crimes.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mainstream women‚Äôs rights into national strategies. Support the empowerment of women and girls by ensuring access to education for all and access to land rights, and by investing in community programs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Extend programs that engage with communities through human rights-based education and other community empowerment models that address social issues related to modern slavery such as violence against women, child protection, and early marriage.  
&gt;  
&gt;Development partners must expand support to Pacific Island countries and territories to strengthen climate change resilience and minimise the number of those forced to migrate. This must be joined by action on the root causes of climate change and the provision of safe, orderly, and dignified migration pathways for climate migrants.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Fund and support research that examines the vulnerabilities that boys face** and that addresses gaps in knowledge on modern slavery more broadly, including prevalence of different forms of modern slavery and with a focus on at-risk sectors.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i1ni4y/modern_slavery_report_recommended_better_support/,iainmf

![video](k5b1433yuce51 "" "")

The incident is believed to have taken place in a bar in Oklahoma City, USA last week but it is not known for sure if the pair are a a couple.¬†The clip was filmed by a customer who was sitting behind the couple in the bar and it is unknown what prompted the incident. The footage begins the woman and her male partner sitting tensely at the bar.  

The woman shouts 'Cool. Cool. Get it!' and launches her hand to slap him again - but the man gently restrains her for a moment. However she continues to swear at him and then hits him hard across his body three times. He utters something inaudible to her and she replies with 'Are you f\*\*king kidding me? You wish! You want to hit me? You f\*\*king wish!'.¬†

Nowhere is this more obvious then our perception of homosexual males (even if it's accepted now is seen as most deviant, nobody want to see it). Lesbians are cool because of vagina, bi women are cool because vagina/penis (which is seen as a natural evil almost but necessary, maybe they ""aren't even attracted to penis""), and normal straight men are normal because vagina.

2020-08-01 22:00:20,Made my sister cry by arguing that not all men are rapists,"So I was sat outside with my dad and sister and the topic of my sister learning to drive came up. I said I thought my mum‚Äôs reasoning for not getting the male driving instructor I had for my sister was extremely sexist. My mum doesn‚Äôt want my sister to have the same driving instructor as me simply because he is a man and wants to get a female driving instructor instead, under the basis that apparently male driving instructors have a tendency to sexually assault/ rape female students. 

My dad and sister actually both agreed with my mum. I sarcastically replied that ‚Äúyep, I guess all men you don‚Äôt know are rapists‚Äù. My dad then said that statistically men are more likely to commit those types of crimes so teaching women to fear men they don‚Äôt know is justified as being cautious. I then replied if we were talking about statistics, did he know that black individuals are much more likely to be convicted of a crime than white individuals. Does that make me justified in not wanting to sit next to a black person on the bus because they might steal something from me? Is me preferring to have a white driving instructor over a black one just me being cautious? I also explained that men are much more statistically likely to have a crime committed against them than a woman is. So, why are we teaching women to fear men? If it‚Äôs all based on cold hard statistics, why are we not instead teaching men to fear other men? 

All this was to show that the judicial system is biased towards men and blacks. Yes, the statistics might suggest that men and black people are more likely to commit crimes, but that doesn‚Äôt take into account the racist and sexist nature of judicial institutions. Women are less likely to be arrested for or charged severely for the same crime that a man commits, and so do whites receive favourable treatment than do blacks. This all then acts to skew the statistics to make it seem like men and blacks commit more crime when that may not be the case in reality.

After all this, I think my sister realised that she had no decent argument to come back with and thus reverted to the age old technique a lot of women use when losing an argument in order to emotionally manipulate the white knights and that is to cry. She went inside and cried, just enough to make sure my dad could hear her so she could go in and ‚Äúcomfort‚Äù her and obviously side with her. Because the crying woman is always in the right, no matter how poor her argument is. I‚Äôm sure if I went away and cried it would‚Äôve been a very different story. 

We‚Äôve since got over it. My family doesn‚Äôt really do the talk things out and make up thing, we just all pretend to forget about it and act like everything‚Äôs normal. I can‚Äôt wait to get back to university",1.0,1.0,1.0,281.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i1sndk/made_my_sister_cry_by_arguing_that_not_all_men/,The_Eraser123

The patriarchy causes inequality in men and women, the discussion of who is hurts more is beyond pointless, and is rather bigoted, no matter what side you're on. I only write this post because I see a lot of people talking about how a lot of Men's Rights issues come from feminism, and while a lot of misandry does seem to get thrown around in feminist circles, the actual movement is not the enemy. A \*real\* feminist wouldn't participate in misandry, and whereas a lot of them do, a lot of them don't.

I'm not exactly sure what the point of this post was, I guess I just want to know how many of you agree or disagree with me.

2020-08-02 07:24:40,It seems that male children are also treated disposable when compared to female children,"To me, the idea of male disposability starts to happen to males when they just children, and circumcision is one of the things that proves that. 

It's so sexist and so unfair that male babies get circumcised, while the genitals of females are protected by law in the United States. 

Male babies go through a lot of pain when they get circumcised while female babies don't have to go through any pain because of the law protecting them. 

Females have their own version of the foreskin . The ""Clitoral Hood"" is basically the female version of the foreskin (prepuce).

So people who think male foreskins are gross looking and are very unhygienic need to understand that females have their own version of the foreskin.

I think it's very unfair that females get to keep their foreskins in the United States, but males don't.

Male children are just as vulnerable as female children are, so they need to be protected from things like genital mutilation like how female children are. Male children deserve the same protection that female children get.

This sounds like:

Blackmail: ‚ÄúIn blackmail the threat might consist of physical injury to the threatened person or to someone loved by that person, or injury to a person's reputation.‚Äù
https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/blackmail 

Extortion: ‚Äúany person who takes money or property from another by means of illegal compulsion may be guilty of the offense. When used in this sense, extortion is synonymous with blackmail, which is extortion by a private person. In addition, under some statutes a corporation may be liable for extortion.‚Äù

‚Äú(b) Whoever, with intent to extort from any person, firm, association, or corporation, any money or other thing of value, transmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.‚Äù

I see a lot of bitching from blatant brigaders who don't even post in this sub about how everyone here just 'complains' instead of do anything useful and as usual there's zero introspection on there part of why that is.

Some of the complaining about issues is on minor topics, but by and large if people actually took part in the sub properly they'd realise there are some very real issues like how women keep getting away with horrible shit and everyone just keeps brushing it off or downplay it.

Is it any wonder then that groups like MTGOW and incel pop up in greater numbers and more and more men are just going fuck it and avoiding society altogether? Would be nice if the brigading turds took five seconds to maybe think about what they're doing because given the way reddit by and large behaves when it comes to real discrimination against men they downplay it constantly and run damage control for horrible women who act like criminals and sociopaths online and off.

By the way, I'm going to make a prediction, if any users from outside the sub even bother looking at this topic I guarantee you they're going to prove my point and call me anti-woman for even talking about this. I hope I'm proven wrong but they'll probably either ignore the topic because they only ever look at blatant click-bait or rage bait or just spam at me because they can't take it when someone dares to criticise the way society treats women.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i299pu/when_the_response_to_genuine_discrimination_and/,Lethn

2020-08-02 20:49:55,Growing up being fat was a horrible experience,"So I've moved to many different homes when I was in school. Making new friends was always tough because I was pretty shy and introverted kid. 

I started to gain weight because I didn't had many friends to play with, it gotten to a point where my chest started to get a little fat. I became very self conscious around that time, my self-esteem dropped  very low as well. 

Now I moved to this new home (I've been here for almost 10 years now) when I was around 12-13, it took me a while to make friends but when I did I was enjoying their company. I used to hang out with a group of boys and used to play hide and seek and all those stupid games. 

One evening when we were playing, some of those boys started touching and squeezing my chest which I was already very ashamed about for being breast-like. I told them to stop and pushed them but they kept doing it (smiling and laughing coz they thought they were just messing with me) . I just felt pretty shitty about it. I was around 15 when that happened, it destroyed my self esteem. 

I never told my parents what happened because I didn't know what to tell them, I felt like it was my fault because I was fat and I should've seen it coming. 

I wish we had some awareness classes like the one they have for girls in schools because I've seen many boys suffer from this sort of behavior from their peers or friends which they would describe this thing as just a playful thing but the one on whom this thing has been practiced could be devastating.",1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i2bj1e/growing_up_being_fat_was_a_horrible_experience/,Nisarg_Vaghela555

2020-08-03 00:14:10,"Yes, body standards for men exist and are absurd. And no, you aren't a freak for saying this."," It seems to be such a common sentiment that 'men are the shallower gender' or the belief that a man's attractiveness is determined mostly by his personality and not his actual attractiveness. I think a lot of you have been shut down by men and women alike for voicing anything that contradicts those beliefs and is treated as a freak by others for having this opinion. I'm here to tell you: **Yes, your struggles are valid. You are not alone.** Men have a high body standard placed on them, and if anything, our standards are much higher than women's. A lot of men can confirm as well, but they are just shut down by the gynocentric crowd.

If you go to any thread on any website where the women ask ""Do you find this breast size/ass size/hip size/any female dimorphic body part attractive?"", almost all answers will rush in to say 'yes'. A lot will say that they don't give a damn about it at all. Women can be attractive regardless of breast size, their butt size, their curviness, and their height.

On the other hand, women have certain physical standard cutoffs that are inherent to the male figure. Shortness in men can be considered unattractive. Short penis in men can also be considered unattractive. Hell, height and penis shaming is now a common thing on social media. Basically, if you are a man, there will be things that are cutoffs for women that are out of your control.

And this is just talking about things you can't control. For things you can control like weight and muscle, men are held up to higher standards as well. Women can be attractive in many types of bodies, if anything, they can be considered attractive at a much higher body fat percentage. On the other hand, as a man, you are already expected to be thin, and you would catch any eye either unless you have some muscle definition.

 So lads, I know what you've been through and I've experienced all of it myself. If anything, not being acknowledged at all for my struggles is the worst part. It made me feel like a freak; that I'm just imagining it all in my head.

Your struggles and your insecurity: they are all real and valid. But don't give up! There is so much in life to live for besides besides being attractive according to such absurd standard.

2020-08-03 03:37:43,I‚Äôm afraid of dating women at this point. How do I rid of this need to be with someone in order to be happy?,"Hey lads! 

Well first and foremost I‚Äôm straight just in case some of you suggest I date men instead. 

I‚Äôve been in a few relationships, ones where I was both physically and emotionally abused but left to pick up the pieces on my own because I had no support when I reached out. 

I‚Äôm doing much better these days by myself. I save more, I get the luxury of spending on myself more too and I‚Äôm not in a toxic relationship which makes life so much better. 

So recently I thought I‚Äôd get back to dating again but I came to the realisation that I‚Äôm actually afraid of dating women at this point. 

Mainly because of past experiences but also because just after meeting a few it always seems one sided. It‚Äôs always about them instead of the both of us. That applied to my previous relationships too 

Plus with all that‚Äôs going on at the moment with false allegations and people going around cheating or just leaving you once they‚Äôre done with you. It just puts me off from dating completely. 

I‚Äôm fine with not dating but when the loneliness sets in, it does feel depressing. 

I just need help with ways to rid of that feeling and just be content with myself.

2020-08-04 03:41:01,Good Things About Being a Man,"I personally believe being a man in a Western country is harder to be a woman, all other factors beinf equal. Still clearly ones family situation as a child dwarfs society impact, even considerintg laws disempowering men have become very extreme.

But I want to focus on ways in which I think it is advantageous to be a man. Your sexual life declines gradually, doesn't fall off a clifd in menopause, and sexual underporformance with ageing is usually readily treatable in men. Also, no one covers for you if you misbehave, so no one other than your parents will spoil you and reinforce negative behaviour.

Society doesnt encourage you to fantasistic thinking to your own aggrandizement (it will encourage you to fantastic thinking to your debasement if you let them). Irrationality is unhelpful to the psyche, and it leads to baf behavioue, and bad behaviour leads to unhappiness. The most extreme example of this I have ever seen is with Catholic feminists Melinda Tankard Reist - who has moved on from more Catholic leaning books impugning abortion to more mainstream man hating, eg. ""there is a war on women"" and we ""live in a rape culture"" because teenage boys eatch too much porn. Her colleague Caitlin Roper focuses on the urgent social crisis of men penetrating realistic latex sex dolls, which she sees as analagous to rape.

This level of irrationality isnt healthy for man or woman, but at least as a man your not massively incentivised in most domains, including being given cold hard cash, to make ever more outlandish claims aggrandising your gejder ingroup and demonising the gender outgroup.

I am glad I am not incentivised at a societal level to be unjust, to make terrible slanders against billions of people I never met, and to create legal and other structures that unecessarily make it very much harder for large segments of the population to live a good and full life.",1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i33y73/good_things_about_being_a_man/,playingpoodles

2020-08-04 10:55:55,"""Being one of those MRAs won't get you validation from boys.""","Okay, so this kinda long, but please bear with me here. This literally happened today, and I'm stressed about this and don't want this to hurt my friendship. 

I'm a girl and have been interested in men's rights for quite a while now, since I was in 8th grade. I was very well-aware of the biases that society has towards women and against men (i.e false rape allegations, custody, reproductive choices, domestic violence, much, much more) at a young age, in fact, when I was little and used to hear people say phrases like ""women's shelters"" and would ask ""What about men?"" 

Anyway, enough of that, I knew that being open about being a pro-MRA female was dangerous, as I'd get called an internalized misogynist, pick-me girl, and little miss not-like-the-other-girls. I only talked men's rights with friends I deeply trusted, and a lot agreed with me. This one friend of mine (let's call her Dominique) seemed to tolerate my men's rights talks, and I really trusted her deeply. She didn't seem to interested, but she agreed with some things. 

However, today made me realize that she isn't as pro-MRA as I thought she was. 

We had band camp today (didn't get cancelled due to the fact that my county went from red to orange pretty damn fast in terms of COVID stuff) and Dominique was on her phone during a break when I heard her ask, ""You do realize that being one of those MRAs won't get you validation from boys, right?"" Surprised, I asked her why she was randomly bringing it up, and she showed me her phone, revealing that she was looking at all of the accounts I follow on Instagram. I follow a lot of anti-feminist and pro-MRA pages, and she found these and immediately accused me of looking for dick. 

I wish I could be a girl MRA and not be seen as a pick-me. This made me very angry, though I didn't start a dramafest about it because I hadn't seen Dominique in so long and we get along so well. I'm still very angry and needed to get this off my chest.",1.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i3bfe7/being_one_of_those_mras_wont_get_you_validation/,kennatellsitall

Why  do you believe woman's traditional gender roles are more flexible and shouldn't be enforced, while male gender roles should absolutely inherently be enforced either legally or socially (conscription, protecting, providing, etc)?

You think men should be conscripted, but also women should have the right to  vote in politics (something which isn't traditionally done).

Feminism has been demanding that women be ""freed"" from their traditional gender roles for decades now, largely successfully and you've gone along with it, while men are still supposed to follow male gender roles.

You think men should follow every single gender expectation but you sure as hell don't expect women to do the same, in fact, in some assbackwards way you seem to think women not following their role is the fault of men  too.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i3flbg/questions_for_conservatives/,IcyChillMikes

Did you know that you could disarm any Feminist argument in less than 15 seconds if you understood only one female character trait?                                                                             #men

MGTOW helps out the MRM by causing an effect on scociety by refusing to interact with women due to men being screwed over by a multitude of things and the MRM helps MGTOW by giving them the statistics and facts to back up the lifestyle, why it's good for men and incurages men to go MGTOW, we give men a reason to go MGTOW but this is of course personal preference depending on the man, sometimes it works out, sometimes, it doesn't.

2020-08-04 22:51:09,Now apparently being anti-feminist is akin to being a white supremacist,""" Half of young men  thought ‚Äòfeminism has gone too far‚Äô and ‚Äòmakes it harder for men to  succeed‚Äô, more than twice the proportion of young women who felt the  same.' ...

""And in a climate  where men feel more uncertain of their place in society, there is  considerable worry that this way of thinking could occupy a place in the  mainstream.' ...

""White identity is no  longer a socially acceptable refuge for those young people who feel  that things are working against them, and who seek an escape from  feelings of victimhood and inadequacy. This is what makes ‚Äòthe manosphere‚Äô ‚Äì male online subcultures linked to  the alt-right, focused on grievances around sex, popularity and personal  suppression ‚Äì and men‚Äôs rights movement so dangerous.' ....

""As society heads  into a looming economic crisis, we must ensure young men understand that  accepting their place in an equal society is not just a benefit for  everyone else ‚Äì a just and fair society will benefit them, too.'

2020-08-05 01:55:55,"The ""Sex Cartel"" explains everything about gender and sex","**The sexual customs and taboos in traditional societies are created by women, and act in most women's advantage.**

Traditionally women exchange sex for resources, creating a market for sex, however this is not a free market; women, especially older and less attractive women control the market through ""slut shaming"", crimes against prostitution, male homosexuality, and even sex outside marriage, in order to create a ""coochie cartel"" that pressures men into marriage.

Marriage itself can then be biased against men, without fear men will refuse to marry.

This explains why women ""slut shame"", ""incel shame"", and are generally against pornography, prostitution, and casual sex.

It also explains the suffragettes obsession with prostitution and 'modern' feminists obsession with rape, as well as the double standards over male rape victims, female promiscuity, etc.

The war of the sexes is best seen as a battle between younger women who want a free market in sex, and older or less attractive women who want a cartel. Men are not an adversary in the battle of the sexes, men are the battleground.

but the biggest benefactor of aa isn‚Äôt black men. it‚Äôs women, especially white women. even though aa makes it tougher for white men and asian men for college, it actually makes it a lot EASIER for white women and asian women to get in. yet the conservation is typically only about race, not gender. 

right now black people still make up a minority of college students, but women are being over represented greatly among new college students and grads. it seems as if affirmative action has run its course for women at the expense of men. so why is nobody ever going to mention it?

How come if a woman cums early this is never seen as an issue? Its almost as if the woman must cum first before the man or the man is considered to not be fufulling the desires of his wife. Like is this not a case of double standards and favouring woman. 

Another thing is, woman sometimes become overweight or stop taking hygeine serious and then the man finds it hard to get aroused, yet it is still considered to be a problem of the man and not the woman.

Don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying that men should be lackadasical in this department because its important to take care of your woman if you want a succesful long term relationship but yeah, the whole way the media portrays these issues reeks of double standards.",1.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i4fcdd/how_is_premature_ejaculation_actually_determined/,deprogrammed48

2020-08-06 08:37:11,Loneliness &amp; Friendship Advice Inquiry. Anyone feel more isolated as they age?,"Hi. It appears there's some existing posts related to this, but thought it'd still ask.

Who here is becoming more isolated the older they get? Why?  Who here has been isolated / lonely for some time (pre-quarantine)?  

Does anyone have practical / applicable advice for an adult man that has the time &amp; interest in making new friends?  How do you make friends despite being shy / having SA?

Me.  I'm 35. I grew up in another city then the one I live/work in now for 10 yrs.  I've had social anxiety (SA) since at least my teen yrs, but I've gotten a lot better over time &amp; through work.  I went to university, but didn't make any friends. SA. My HS friends went by the wayside. I tried to reconnect yrs later, but they didn't care to reconnect.  Despite the SA, I've casually dated (I guess I'm alright looking &amp; can be charming when not anxious). I'd say I've had 2 LTR partners maybe worth marrying or dating LT, but both failed. I seem to date very social extroverts.  I made friends biking when I first moved here, but I became less involved in that after an injury &amp; one LTR.  Now I'm single, locked down, have one friend from back home (hours away &amp; I don't even like him much, in short, he's too 'woke'&amp; 'beta'), &amp; feel a bit incompetent &amp; hopeless in making &amp; keeping friends. My bdays come &amp; go w/ only a call from my mom &amp; the ex that remembers my bday. I'd bike again or play music w/ folks but have such anxiety &amp; fear that I'm not 'athletic enough' or talented at playing anymore.  Any advice is appreciated.

So I am a single straight male looking for love. So my best decision was to talk to a female I knew through one of my friends (g 1). When we talked she made it seem like she was into me. We were asking questions back and forth and eventually I asked for her phone number (prior to this we were talking on Snapchat ).
This is where her friend comes into play ( g 2). She (g 1) gives me her friends phone number ( 2) and they both start their scheme. she (g 1)acts like she never gave me a phone number, while her friend (g 2) acted like She didn't know who I was. This went on for a while until I figured out they were playing me. in the end she (g 1) told me she didn't loke me and that i was stupid for falling for it. I personally think what they did was kinda fucked up. I might be a little stupid for falling for it, but whats wrong with now day females? Why do so many of them play with our feelings?

A common refrain when discussing dating is that women get more dates, but men get more quality dates.  My response is...huh?

Why do men get more quality dates?  A date is an opportunity to click with someone, so more dates means more opportunity.  The only way men would get more quality dates is if you assume that men are inherently shittier than women, i.e. that women need more dates to sift through the dating pool.

To me, this seems like nothing more than another attempt to dismiss men's feelings, and diminish men in the process.

2020-08-07 03:23:08,How I View Feminism Also Why Whether It's Right Or Wrong Why We/Women Believe That Our Problems/Disavantages As A Women Are More Important Than Men's.,"Hi, I'm a 24 year women and after reading some posts and other online comments about feminism and other topics I thought I'd give my opinion on it.  This is proberly controversal and I'll understand if I don't get upvotes.

Feminism in my view is Men and Women being treated equally/fairly as each other however as time went on, idiots (sometimes other women) have changed its true meaning and made it seem like feminism means women are better than men, women should be treated better than men due what happened in the past which I think is completely wrong. 

So my word of advice unless we're saying it in an offensive way, when some women say we're feminists it can actually mean we just believe Men and Women being treated equally/fairly as each other and are actual rational people unlike the stir crazy girls who hit guys for no reasons and think they can get away with anything because their a women. I've seem some guys quickly get offended and defensive when someone says they're a femenist but hold on, women thinking they're better and being idiots isn't the only meaning to that word so please don't assume.

As for my view on men as a women I thought some people might be interested in my perspective. 

So I think sometimes guys need to be more aware on average, how intimidating they can feel to women who don't know them and when we're alone with guys for the first time. I have friends that are guys, one of them, a bigger than the others after I worked with him for about a month and chatted with him on the phone for a lot longer then eventually he invited me over to his place just to hang out, it turned out fine, we just watched some tv shows together, talked then I left and we've repeated this but despite knowing him for a while to tell you the truth I was nervous about being in a room with him alone when he first invited me over. 

Actually understanding and knowing, this guy could overpower me easily if he wanted too, is freaking hard to deal with as a women, you know you're being stupid most of the time that thought pops up, usaully when your alone with a guy you don't know too well. 

That thought pops up again whenever we get offered to be walked home at night and you know logically that its the safest option yet you feel your pride being hurt whenever it happens. Same thing repeats when a guy your uncomfortible around flirts or shows interest in you.

Some women who are idiots get overly defensive when their pride is injured, for example when a women snaps at a guy who was just trying to be polite by opening the door for them or other small things. Its not that they hate you but they take your politeness as looking down on them as the physically weaker sex and to try and soothe their damaged pride they'll lash out, which usually includes shouting and all that. 

As a women I admit my own pride has been injured in certain circumstances but I've always been able to deal with in a rational way unlike certain women who clearly can't handle their ego being damaged and take offence for really stupid things. 

My lifes normal yet as a women I have come across casual sexism, for example a very small thing but something that hurt my pride a lot was when I was the only one out of the group, the rest were guys who had to prove to my teacher that I knew what camera shots the lecturer wanted me to do yet the guys who were in the same situation as me where never asked and I was left wondering why are you questioning my skills and asking me to prove myself and not the other guys on the other camera as well? What hurt even more about that reletavly small incident was that they were very basic camera shots as well. 

Other casual sexism would be a guy staring at me but not really at me, not even looking at my face, if you know what I mean and dancing closer and closer to me in a club, also clearly a lot older than me, so I pretended I didn't notice and had just moved out of his way, my friend after the club had also told me she'd noticed the way he was behaving and had put herself inbetween us while pretending to dance and had hurried away with me while also pretending she hadn't noticed. 

I don't go to clubs regually at all, so I was rather shocked that something like that had happened and had made me feel genually scared and nervous.

I've also encountered sexist jokes as well, which to be fair I've never cared that much about as I think women also can and do make sexist jokes, though to understand why some women can be offended by these jokes despite other women also doing the same with men is pretty simple. 

Gender wise in history, on average we were treated as property so when certain jokes make us feel like guys are looking at us as an object instead of a person I think it's easy to understand why some women can get easily offended by jokes like that. 

To them its not a simple joke but reminding them of what they were taught in schools when they were young, than men used to see their gender as a property, an object only there to sold of and won, even though thats not what you're thinking when you make these jokes, thats what women can see it as and thats why some get far more offended than what they should be.

So honestly when your making jokes about our gender its fine and all but please be aware at what your actually saying and how it can be taken, jokes that could be taken the wrong way by women in general include are ones that make us feel like we're not being looked at as a person and will feel like our history to do with our gender is being insulted even when its not and you didn't actually mean it that way. 

So yeah in a way these small things is a reason why women are still saying ""we should be treated fairly"" even if they're small in my life, just because its small, doesn't mean it should be overlooked. 

Honestly I don't anything physically work wise should be changed, we are on average physically weaker so obviously women sports, men sports, that type of seperation and that type of seperation in work, is fine, only of course it isn't fine when occasionally but it can happen, that a women proves she can physically keep up with a guy, or has some sort of tech that allous her to do that then she should be aloud to cross that seperation.

Honestly what needs to be stomped out and made us feel like we're being treated equal to you guys, is the fact most women have experienced sexism, whether its having their opinion ignored or not taken seriously or their skills being questioned just because their a women and the main one being treated like its okay to behave in an inapropiate way towards us, which even my sister has experienced too, even more to an extent than me as she goes out to pubs and clubs more and told me about times when guys have touched her inapropiately, even one of my work colluges experienced it when a much much older man gave her very creepy comments (especially considering he was like 40 while she was in her early twenties) and tried to reach out and touch her while she was just doing her job. 

So yeah this is my perspective, maybe its things you've heard before, maybe it isn't but I hope this helps. 

Of course guys have lots of problems too that they face that needs to be addressed and not ignored but I do still believe women are at a more disavatage then men. 

I did have an argument with my father about this while he tried to tell me men were treated just as badly as women. 

So my counter argument to everyone who thinks this or just doesn't understand why I think this is this... 

In average women are raped at a much larger pecentage than men are. Women are sexually assulted and physically abused also at a larger pecentage. Yes I personally thankfully have never experience any of this but how is, what problems that the opposite gender is facing, a bigger problem that sexual assult, rape and physical abuse? 

When guys say, we're just as disadvataged as you, or our disadvatages as a man also matter, of course they matter but trying to tell a women that they matter more than whats happening to their gender or their just as important unless its the sucide rates that your arguing and that is just as important but anything else? 

To us it immidiatly feels like guys are making light of these things, unless it's the higher man sucicidal rate.

Women are like inside our heads or if we're directly arguing with you. 

So... you're trying to tell us that your disavantages as a man are more important than... 

Physical abuse against my gender?

Sexual assult against my gender?

Rape against my gender?

Then thats also where...the pure anger and other emotions can also come from in arguments such as this from us, as to us whether its right or wrong but this is what we think, anyone that argues against this, is not taking these statistics/(these women who's were likely traumatised/lives ruined/ or even possibly killed ) seriously.",1.0,1.0,1.0,24.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i4yaz7/how_i_view_feminism_also_why_whether_its_right_or/,cecld

2020-08-07 05:07:02,I am not angry with feminists,"I came to a realisation in the last few days that I think is important.  I am not angry at feminists.  I had been.  Specifically, certain housing advantages would have been available to me in my circumstances as a woman that weren't, and society disregarded my contributions as a non-elite man which discouraged me from contributing which in my view is the most destructive thing of all.

&amp;#x200B;

But I just realised.  I am not angry with feminists.  They're people trapped in irrational belief systems - I imagine many of them started off as progressive humanists, and they ended up just seeking to advance the interests of one group to the disregard of the other, and block the other group's attempts to reform things to better themselves.  They are irrational haters.  I can understand that.  That would be a terrible place to be, psychologically speaking.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem isn't feminists per se - the probaly is Western progressivism generally.  It has stopped being progressive.  It has become prescribed thought.  But because Western countries are relatively wealthy, and perhaps also because family structures have weakened so, people don't see it.  We can all look at Iran and say,  it is grotesque and undesirable to impose a doctrine of thinking on a population without allowing critical analysis or genuine attempts to compare the idea with reality.  Feminism has become the same, actually, almost no one, publically at least, dares to submit it to critical analysis, and those who do are quickly silenced one way or another (you've lost your job). 

&amp;#x200B;

In America, this irrational thinking that will use politics to stop itself being questioned is being expanded right now to the whole race debate.  I remember one retired American policeman a few years who pointed out that blacks were not more likely to be killed proportionate to their interactions with police than other races.  The black host, Lemon I think, cut straightaway to a black man who told how 'hurt' he was by the policeman's comments.  Lemon said something like, 'can't you see that your views are deeply hurtful?'.  The policeman then mumbled and beat around the bush.  He should have said, 'no,  I just said something that was true and non-offensive, I'm concerned people in society feel entitled to feel hurt by that, that's dangerous for them and us'.  Of course, he didn't.

&amp;#x200B;

But I personally believe that there is no domain other than feminism and possibly the gay marriage debate where questioning the narrative has been effectively banned.  You could question the narrative publically, but that will be the last time you do as you'll likely be de-platformed, and you could lose your job.  And you will be emotionally attacked and accused of being a bad person.

&amp;#x200B;

This is obviously bad for secular society.  When men hurt more than they would otherwise need to, this is an increase in total unecessary human suffering and is bad for secular society.   It's also bad for feminists, they're missing out on their chance to do good because they're mind is trapped in unquestioned dogma - and we, as Western societies, are trapping them by giving in to them all the time.",1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i509il/i_am_not_angry_with_feminists/,playingpoodles

Yes men‚Äôs suicide rates are higher than women‚Äôs but that doesn‚Äôt discredit women‚Äôs. Women are much more common as  victims of rape but that doesn‚Äôt mean men don‚Äôt suffer rape as well.
 
There are plenty of twitter screenshots and other examples on this sub of women saying horrible stuff about men but on feminism subs there is just as much evidence of men saying things just as bad about women. Both the men‚Äôs rights movement and feminism need to realise that we should all be working towards equality for all instead of equality for men or equality for women.

Justifying being against women or against men because they‚Äôre against you isn‚Äôt okay. Everyone has the potential to be just as toxic as anyone else but the only reason not everyone is a pos is because there‚Äôs enough people making the decision and effort to be better.

I have for a long time watched the feminism sub with disgust as it echoes ignorant ideas and fuels hate towards men, a place where the slightest implication of there being a positive side to masculinity would get you banned or downvoted to oblivion.

I now realize that my support for the MRM has blinded me to what this sub has turned into, this isn't a place for discussion and debate anymore it's just an echo chamber for views and ideas that will never solve the issue, this place is filled with the exact same shit as the feminism sub.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i5cdwg/when_fighting_monsters/,Tourettesaintshit

2020-08-07 21:32:49,Just saw someone publicly &amp; falsely accused of sexual harrassment by a 80k follower TikToker and he can't even defend himself because he doesn't have a platform.,"So I'm not a regular Visitor of this Sub and not sure where to post this but I think this is relevant for the theme of this Sub and I'm more curious of opinions.  


So the incident itself was not some big deal. A female Influencer makes a tiktok Video About how annoying it is when Girls do not get off by their boyfriends and instead of communicating that with their boyfriend and telling them what to do, they go to their friends and gossip or talk bad About the men.  


The guy left a three word comment of ""teach me then"", as in ""if my girlfriend is not satisfied she should 'teach me then' how she wants to be stimulated."" (which he later clarified)  She then makes a Response Video to this comment, saying ""I'm Pretty sure this was sexually suggestive (harrassing/inappropriate/etc). ""  and uses this as an intro to talk About female anatomy. But that few second intro seems very dangerous to me painting an innocent men as an abuser.

&amp;#x200B;

So she essentially took that ""teach me then"" and felt it was a personal attack or harrasment as in him telling her to have sex with him, which is very far from what he actually said. When he responded with something like if you are not 100% certain if something is sexual harrassment then maybe do not make some allegations like this and do you even know what damage that can do to a man's life  (IG is linked and identity can be found out) and saying he doesn't even have a platform to defend himself because she has the 80k followers and he has under 100.   


So that girl has a lot of power with her following and due to that misunderstanding paints the guy as someone doing sexual misconduct. When pointed all that out, she just shrugs it off with ""Well you are not my boyfriend so it was still not appropriate to say that."" Which again is misunderstanding the comment he left.  He was not saying it to her directly (as later clarified), it made sense in the context of her Video, too. He was even agreeing with her Point of her Video. Just repeating what she said in a different Phrase  but then she makes allegations smh.

    
Are we really at that Point  where a male has to Phrase everything they say very carefully with a lot of clarifications and explainations so that Nothing can be misconstrued to not have your reputation ruined by a false Allegation.   


Even if a Video like that is deleted, or she makes an apology Video (which she currently doesnt seem to be going to) then not everyone who saw the first Video will see the apologies  or clarifications so the damage will be done.",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i5dv77/just_saw_someone_publicly_falsely_accused_of/,OneAttentionPlease

2020-08-08 07:40:22,Fathers penalized by sexist outdated NH parenting laws.," Please just take one second to fix New Hampshire archaic child support laws and please share the post with any local fathers rights/mens rights pages.

Right now in NH, one person, typically the father, pays 100% of the child support obligation with no consideration for parenting time. This law would simply do what most other states do, calculate both parents paying each other and split the difference.  Just asking for equality. 

I personally spent $25k to get 50% custody, and am probably going to lose it because I am not at the point where I'm putting child support on credit cards.

Right now I have a 5 figure income and I pay 420/w for child support. With this law I would pay 150. That shows the extreme difference and how insane this is. That 1170 month would almost pay my rent. 

So again, please sign and share, thank you.

What I mean about toxic masculinity are certain behaviours imposed by society on men (a man must earn money for their family, a man must not cry, a man cant show emotions), earning himself the right to a relationship. This type of behaviour can lead to certain problems, like a certain entitlement for man to be with someone (typical, Im a nice guy, why wont you give me your number) and a feeling of not beeing enough (i did everything right and this woman didnt give me her number. Something must be wrong with me), which can lead to depression. I know that men dont like to be confronted about this topic, because I actually got offended by it the first i heard about it, but now, I believe it is a problem that both femininists and mens rights activists should want to tackle",1.0,1.0,1.0,26.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i5y13t/m20_how_is_the_subject_of_toxic_masculinity_viewd/,GustaQL

2020-08-08 22:47:00,A response to feminist claims on custody,"This is going to be more of a ""shower thoughts/skepticism of empirical data"" post than a research one. 

I was thinking about the average feminist responses that I've been given when I've talked about custody and the possible bias men face and many of them don't seem to hold water or make sense to me.

I will name some of them and attempt to address them and I'd like to hear your thoughts on the matter.


&gt;Women are the primary caregivers, the primary caregivers get most of the custody in divorce, therefore there is no bias against men because women spend more time on childcare/domestic work. If men put in more effort, then they'd be given equal custody. 

Several things here:
1. That doesn't tell us how much of the custody gap it explains. It is like somebody bringing up the fact that black people commit more crime than white people in an attempt to eliminate the possibility of racist bias in the law enforcement and the criminal justice system (like for instance overpolicing). I don't doubt this ""fact"" explains a certain portion of the gap, but just naming it alone without telling us how much of the gap in custody it accounts for is a rather simple way to disprove the existence of bias.
2. One can still argue judges can have biased beliefs about fatherhood and associate motherhood with being the primary caregiver based on this vague average which isn't an absolute fact either because in some marriages men are the caregivers and women are the providers. As a consequence that assumption can lead to mothers getting the upper hand due to fact custody disputes start with the assumption the mother is possibly a better parent or the primary caregiver which in return leads to fathers having to prove they have equally contributed to childcare. Even studies on gender stereotypes have found that we still associate nurturing behavior with women and nurturing behavior plays a role in the position you are assumed to hold as a parent in society (whether you are the provider or the caretaker).
3. If we assume the gap in childcare explains all of the custody disparities and judges hold absolutely no biases, the fact that women tend to be the primary caregivers alone tells us nothing about why they are the primary caregivers. It doesn't explain anything - it is an empirical fact, it doesn't answer why questions. Is it because women are simply biologically better suited for childcare, is it because of traditional gender roles or is this just what women want (they choose to stay at home because of their flexible role as a parent and a worker while imposing the provider role on men which tends to be less flexible)? Men would be more than happy to stay at home and do childcare were it not for things like money which is the cause for many divorces (the loss of income of the husband), or their wives' demands which keep them as the wage slave of the family (one survey comes from the Myth of Male Power and there are tons of others like it) or the lack of equal opportunities (paternity leave) and the praise of motherhood which is often associated with being the caregiver. 

Feminists who claim that traditional gender roles are the status quo and that we are socialised to conform to certain behaviors (and they are not completely wrong) sure do seem to be the ones to ignore their existence or actively perpetuate them when it comes to the custody debate or reduce the issue to being a women's issue. 

&gt;Men just don't ask for custody. If they asked for custody, they would just get it.

I take several issues with this claim:
1. The studies feminists typically cite that show men are equally successful with custody, if not more successful are usually cherry picked or don't even support their position to begin with.
2. Let's assume they are completely accurate for the sake of argument, how does this disprove our position and how much ""custody"" do fathers exactly get? Fathers should be assumed to be equal parents from the get go. They shouldn't have to ask for custody, it should be a default assumption that they are of equal value. The idea that men just need to ask for custody like a beggar begs for some money on the street just shows that we treat fathers like sub-parents who need to ask to be seen as equal.
3. Shared parenting has many more benefits than disadvantages which are usually based on pseudo-science feminists bring up to argue fathers are not equally important and the equal involvement of fathers in their children's lives is not of the best interest of the child - something else to note is that shared parenting legislation doesn't say every father is equally fit to be a parent - but it says fathers should be considered to be equal parents, unless they can be proven to be unfit for childcare whether it is because they don't care about the child or because they have committed acts of abuse which can be proven and aren't mere allegations that we should interpret as facts because ""believe accusers"".

&gt;Most decisions which argue the child belongs to the mother are made by both parents without the involvement of the courts.

Really? There are no external influences? Like possibly fathers being discouraged and just deciding to give up because the fight is not worth fighting? How does that apply to cases where they fight the good fight? 

&gt;Men abuse their wives more than the reverse.

I call that feminist bullshit which even if it were 100% true, it wouldn't explain anything unless in most situations it is proven fathers who want custody are proven abusers who don't deserve to have custody which seems absurd on many levels. The same applies to child abuse which women are prone to doing as well (children are mostly abused by their mothers statistically speaking, however an honest person can conclude the fact doesn't answer why questions - it could be because mothers are more involved in the child's life). This whole misandrist attempt on the part of feminists to paint men and fathers as wife beaters, child beaters and molesters is exactly the problem which is holding fathers back (so thank you for conserving the status quo again).

&gt;Men don't get equal or more custody because of misogyny.

This is called trickle down equality - any men's issue can be blamed on misogyny which yet again preserves the status quo which views women as victims and doesn't treat men's issues as their own legitimate issues which are the result of sexism against men. Trickle down equality seeks to deny any sort of privilege women have in society and instead paint these privileges as disadvantages.

The idea women are better parents, children belong to their mothers and men are not equally important or capable of caring for their children is by definition misandry as it is also prejudice against men. And it's funny how the very same people who complain about ""patriarchy hurting men, too"" will also often perpetuate it when they oppose shared parenting (such as NOW which has been opposing it since the 1980's) or argue fathers are abusive deadbeats.

&gt;False allegations of domestic abuse and parental alienation are not an obstacle for fathers to get custody and they don't hurt them.

That seems false and again based on cherry picked studies, but I don't have much information on it. I'd like to know your thoughts on this. 

Also, it does hurt fathers emotionally as well as the child who will be the recipient of all of the allegations and alienation and it might discourage fathers from seeking custody as well.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i60aq7/a_response_to_feminist_claims_on_custody/,Nicksvibes

I agree that if the woman wants the child, she should ALWAYS be allowed to keep it. You should never force an abortion on someone.

But if the man wants to keep the child, too bad ""mY BoDY mY CHoICE, PEriodt""

So, no matter what, according to your rules, the man has no say over the survival of his own child. People often forget it takes two to make a child. And making the blanket statement ""it should always be the woman's choice"" enables a lot of bad women to take advantage of the unequal power. Also it's HIS DNA too ""his body"" and it's his biological/physiological property should be respected just like any other form. Just because your pregnant doesn't make him any less of a parent. Now I think most women could agree/empathize with men that it's unfair in the scenario i presented above that if a man wanted to keep the child he couldn't but a women could.

These are the facts: There is an inequality when it comes to the decision whether to abort or not.

I've seen many solutions to this grey area/ inequality from lots of people, such as If the mother doesn't want it because it will be such a ""burden on her life"" then give it to the father who would want the baby instead of getting an abortion and killing the baby when the father would've happily raised it. Although I agree it is wrong. You cant force someone to hold your baby for you "" No women should have to go through 9 months of pain"" yes I agree but no man should have to deal with the loss and trauma of losing his child. But you cant force someone to give birth, the same way you cant force a man to pay child support. Men is that unfair/unequal YES ABSOLUTELY. but there's nothing that can really be done with that. Off topic: but in general nobody is really equal or treated the same. that's just life.

At the end of the day women should have the final say But it shouldn't be 100 percent their decision. More like Men should have 50 percent and women have 60 percent, and that extra 10 percent is just because they have reproductive rights / they carry the baby. ( i know math wise it doesn't make sense but u get what i mean)

BUT THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE

is that yes on a legal/government level women should have the final say. 100 percent agree because even if the government did side with men on the scenario above a government still just cant force a women to give birth neither, too many problems arise on that level.

BUT HE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE

is that when it comes to the abortion dispute. Social media and other toxic pro life members like to silence men or simply tell them to shut the fuck up. Men should have some say when it comes to abortions because at the end of the day it's their child too. Should women have the final say, Yes absolutely. But we need to make sure Men feel that their voices are heard too and are part of the overall discussion. Not this elementary school bullshit. Granted the couple in question is in some sort of committed relationship. Obviously men shouldn't have a say if he was a rapist or if it was just some one night stand type of deal. But if not, then men absolutely should have some say.

and i do think if a man wants to keep the baby but the women doesn't. I don't think Its SUPER far fetched for the women to give birth and give the baby to the man, she doesn't have to raise it/ pay child support or event be a guardian. And yes i already know ""But giving birth is horrible and you might die from it, it's not worth it just so the MAN can get his offspring "" First off if she's okay/agrees with this method then it's fine. But if she doesn't want to give birth, then yes she doesn't have to give birth BUT most pregnancies will not result in death some do happen yes but it's not HIGHLY LIKELY. At most you will have minor physical damage to your bones.

It should at least be considered as an option between the two partners.

the decision of whether to abort or not should BE between the two partners. Only. nobody else.",1.0,1.0,1.0,151.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i6q2t0/men_should_have_some_say_when_it_comes_to/,Luke_notlucky

&amp;#x200B;

In this context, I think to myself, how can men - without any social change to be fairer to men, which does not appear to be likely in the foreseeable future to me - do anything?  Sure we can altruistically help and love our brothers, fathers, sons and friends.  But those who can are already doing this.  The issue with feminism isn't that it breaks down relations between men in terms of close friends and family - it is dysfunctional parents with or without additional illogical ideas to try and respond to the problem of death that does this.  Even the most radical feminist doesn't, I believe, seriously seek to or believe it can intervene in direct non-romantic relations (eg. friends, family, but not husband/wife).  

&amp;#x200B;

It is just where the private life intersects the public, marriage, child custody, university places, employment opportunities - to name some key ones - where feminism exerts unquestioned political influence to create relations that in the context (eg. 'divorce') advantage women and disadvantage men.  Now, it is a bigger question of whether this 'advantages' women in the longer term.  I am sceptical, because the rhetorical question is, 'is being given the power to be quite unfair on your counterparty where this excess of power can be easily removed, or indeed was artificially created in the first place, a good thing?'  The rhetorical answer clearly is, 'no'.

&amp;#x200B;

So what can men do? Very little. To me one of the few things we could do is to show females in our lives who are altruists the evidence.  Usually, those women will be indoctrinated in feminism in some form or another, so it may be difficult.  The question I suppose is, 'is this woman really a fair minded person seeking the truth'?  A lot of people, male and female, are not fair minded people seeking the truth. Maybe most.  They're best left alone and not antagonised.  But I believe that many women certainly, at the personal level, can see what is fair from what is not - the only reason many women perhaps question feminism so little - apart from the fact it's superficially to their benefit - is to dissent from feminism publically means to lose platform and possibly career.  It continues by threat.  But we can facilitate an 'underground' so to speak of women who internally understand the injustice and do not support it - and I am convinced such women would pass these beliefs on to their daughters.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i6r91j/male_altruism/,playingpoodles

[Predictors of Sexual Coercion Against Women and Men: A Multilevel, Multinational Study of University Students](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/6474011_Predictors_of_Sexual_Coercion_Against_Women_and_Men_A_Multilevel_Multinational_Study_of_University_Students)

Here is a 2007 survey investigating sexual coercion in romantic relationships in a sample of 7,667 university students (2,084 men and 5,583 women) from 38 sites around the world. It found that 2.8% of men and 2.3% of women reported forced sex in their heterosexual relationships. (Table 1 and 2 on pages 408 and 410 respectively). A slightly higher proportion of the men reported forced sex and a slightly higher proportion of the women reported verbal coercion, with 22.0% of men and 24.5% of women reporting verbal coercion.

Here is a 2015 study about young people‚Äôs sexual victimisation and perpetration in 10 European countries. It found in a sample of 3,480 participants that the prevalence of sexual victimisation by force did not differ significantly between the sexes: 15.8% of men and 19.5% of women reported experiencing force (defined as the use or threat of physical force). Neither did the prevalence of sexual victimisation through exploiting the victim's inability to resist: 14.6% of men and 17.2% of women reported experiencing this form of sexual victimisation. Of the countries surveyed, Cyprus, Greece, Lithuania, Poland and Portugal had higher rates of male victimisation by force and exploitation of inability to resist as compared with female (though in Poland and Portugal, the difference was rather small).

Here is a 2001 study by Fiebert and Osburn investigating sexual coercion among 452 Southern California students (259 females and 193 males).

At the beginning of a class period, students were asked to respond voluntarily, anonymously, and confidentially to a survey regarding sexual coercion. After completing the survey, students placed their completed surveys in an unmarked envelope.

Here are the survey questions.

1. I have gone out on a date with a man/woman because she made me feel I had to.
2. I have been forced by a man/woman to kiss him/her.
3. I have been forced by a man/woman to touch him/her sexually.
4. A man/woman has insisted, without using physical force, that I have sex with him/her even though I didn't want to.
5. A man/woman has made me have sex with him/her without a condom.
6. A man/woman has insisted, without using physical force, that I have oral or anal sex with him/her.
7. I have had sex with a man/woman because he/she threatened me in some way.
8. I had sex with a man/woman because he/she used some type of physical force such as holding down, hitting, hair pulling, biting.
9. A man/woman has threatened me in order to get me to have oral or anal sex with him/her.
10. After having sex with a man/woman, I have felt sexually taken advantage of.
11. I had oral or anal sex with a man/woman because he/she used some type of force such as holding down, hitting, hair pulling, biting.
12. A man/woman has sexually touched my body when I did not want him/her to.

They found that ""A higher percentage of males than females reported having experienced sexual coercion on all items assessing mild, moderate and severe sexual coercion"". The only item where a higher percentage of females than males responded affirmatively was on item 10.

Here is Table 1 in the paper displaying the percentage of positive responses to each item by gender.

Percentage of Positive Responses by Gender on Items 1-12

|Item|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9|10|11|12|

|F|13|19|14|23|12|15|4|5|3|27|2|38|

The findings that are most useful to highlight from this paper are item 7 and 8 and the percentages. 10% of men compared with 4% of women reported having sex with a man/woman because they were threatened, and 6% of men compared with 5% of women reported having sex with a man/woman because their perpetrator used physical force.

In this study, data was collected from Mormons between the ages of 14 and 19. In a sample of 636 males and 754 females, 5% of both genders reported that they ""forced or pressured someone to engage in sexual activities."" Though, it's important to keep in mind that ""pressure"" is a very loose term and ""sexual activities"" does not necessarily mean intercourse, so that 5% figure most probably includes many things outside of the scope of ""forced sex"" (rape).

""Most research suggests that the sexual assault of men is more likely to be violent, and accompanied by more and greater corollary injuries, than sexual assaults of women (however, also see Kimerling, Rellini, Kelly, Judson, &amp; Learman, 2002; and McLean et al., 2005). Here it is important to acknowledge that not all sexual assaults are violent, and often center on coercion of victims. However, ‚Äúrapes‚Äù in the traditional sense of the word have been shown to be more violent when perpetrated against male victims. King (1995) reported that when men are raped in almost all instances some form of physical force is used against the victim, and weapons are commonly involved. Weapons are most likely to be involved when men are sexually assaulted by a stranger (Stermac et al., 2004). Kaufman et al. (1980), describing data drawn from male rape survivors seen in hospital emergency rooms, report men who are sexually assaulted are more likely than women to have nongenital injuries (see also Hillman, Tomlinson, McMillan, French, &amp; Harris, 1990). However, they also conclude that men who are sexually assaulted are not likely to seek medical attention, unless they suffer significant physical injuries.""

**""**More specifically, drawing on a stratified random sample of the American population, Elliott et al. (2004) report higher scores on the Trauma Symptom Inventory for sexually assaulted men than women. On eight of the ten scales of the Inventory, sexually assaulted men report higher levels of distress than sexually assaulted women. Depression also frequently leads to attempts to self-medicate (Burnam et al., 1988; Choquet et al., 1997; Coxell et al., 1999; Iseley &amp; Gehrenbeck-Shim, 1997; Plant, Miller, &amp; Plant, 2004; Ratner et al., 2002; Walker et al., 2005) in efforts to block out memories or overcome feelings of low self-worth (Scarce, 1997). Self-medication includes use/abuse of alcohol, illicit drugs and licit (both prescription and over-thecounter) medications. Male sexual assault victims are more likely than female sexual assault victims to report subsequent alcohol abuse problems, although abuse of illicit drugs does not show a gender difference (Burnam et al., 1988). Additionally, researchers in both England (Plant, et al., 2004) and Australia (deVisser et al., 2003) report that sexually assaulted men are more likely than other men to smoke tobacco.""

And:

""Men who are sexually assaulted commonly present a high degree of depression and hostility (Iseley &amp; Gehrenbeck-Shim, 1997; Walker et al., 2005). Several community-based studies have shown that male sexual assault victims are, in the short run at least, more likely than female victims to present with greater degrees of depression and hostility (Carmen, Ricker, &amp; Mills, 1984; Frazier, 1993; Goyer &amp; Eddleman, 1984).""

[Experiences of men forced-to-penetrate women in the UK](http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/forced-to-penetrate-cases/files/2019/07/BA-FTP-project-report-2019.pdf)

A report which explores the experiences of men who have self-identified as having been forced-to-penetrate (FTP) women. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 men who self-identified as having been FTP a woman. Almost all of the participants indicated that their FTP experiences had negatively impacted their personal lives and relationships in some way. 14 men reported that they had experienced varying types of sexual dysfunction since their FTP experience(s). This included erectile dysfunction; ""when I started trying to have another relationship, I found that I was having impotence problems"" (Participant 7). A lack of libido or reduced sex drive, as well as a desire to avoid sex and sexual relationships was also discussed.

Linked to the above, 18 participants reported difficulties in forming new romantic relationships, often citing difficulty in trusting new partners. This is perhaps to be expected when it is remembered that FTP incidents most frequently involved partners and ex-partners. 

""I find at the moment I haven‚Äôt got trust like I used to, I mean I find it a bit like er, I don‚Äôt trust like, women, in a way, like, the way I used to. I feel like as if it could happen again"" Participant 3. 

""It affects how I view relationships, I‚Äôm single at the moment by choice"" Participant 13. 

For some this inability to trust others and develop new relationships extended to include any and all relationships, not just intimate ones.

Nine participants reported that their careers were impacted, they were unable to work, or that they lost their jobs. This was typically as a result of the severe mental health impacts that they experienced. 

""Now I just sort of lock myself away, I stay at home, I‚Äôm not working anymore"" Participant 24. 

""I‚Äôm nowhere near recovered really. I‚Äôm still under the mental health system, I‚Äôve not worked full time since then"" Participant 18. 

**Men are less likely to view to acknowledge their experiences of sexual assault and are less likely to report it, which likely affects data and statistics on the topic**

[Big Boys Don't Cry: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis of Male Sexual Victimization](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1524838018816979)

This is a review of the literature surrounding male sexual victimisation. It notes that ""Prevailing stereotypical gender roles and sexual scripts are in favor of women‚Äôs ability to acquire (ideal) victim status. However, quite the opposite is true for men who must reject their gender roles and sexual script in order to be considered an (ideal) victim.""

""Existing expectations shape the way that people perceive sexual victimization and may therefore influence the victim‚Äôs own perception of their sexually unwanted experiences (see Figure 2). Davies (2002) suggests that men may never have considered that they could become sexual victims since prevailing gender stereotypes cause them to internalize the belief that male sexual victimization is beyond the realm of possibility. If such an event does occur, they may have trouble accepting not only that it happened to them but also that it happened at all. It is often presumed that men are able to defend themselves if they do not want sexual activity to occur and would find the experience pleasurable given their sexual opportunist nature. In addition, given the existing assumption that the presence of an erection is an indication of a pleasurable erotic experience, it is claimed that men are less traumatized in comparison to women (Bullock &amp; Beckson, 2011). Since men often get an erection, ejaculate, or both during an assault (Bullock &amp; Beckson, 2011), many male victims might feel as if they cannot label their experience as sexual victimization. Furthermore, the nature of male-to-male sexual victimization frequently leads to the conclusion that it is a homosexual act, suggesting that the victim must be gay (Davies et al., 2013). Additionally, men who acknowledge their sexually unwanted experience as rape feel as if they have failed to uphold the masculine ideal (Artime et al., 2014), resulting in a sense of ‚Äústolen or harmed masculinity.‚Äù Men may therefore remain silent, to avoid being viewed as unmasculine and gay.""

""A stereotypical description of rape (i.e., rape scripts) may therefore lead victims to refrain from defining their experience as rape or sexual assault if the rape does not fit into this narrow definition (Peterson &amp; Muehlenhard, 2004). Research has shown that many male victims do not seek help, or wait longer because of difficulties in self-identifying as victims (Machado et al., 2016). Machado, Hines, and Matos (2016) state that masculine gender socialization, social stigmatization, and strong endorsement of sociocultural values appear to be the main reasons why male victims do not seek help. This further increases their already high risk of developing PTSD (Larsen &amp; Hilden, 2016), generating even more negative consequences when they do not get the help they need. Overall, these differences in the possibility of being considered a sexual victim will lead many male victims to refrain from reporting their experience or seeking help."" Indeed, an empirical study of how men describe their own victimization of child sexual abuse and adult rape found that only 24% of adult male victims self-label their experience as rape.

The authors go on to suggest ""Subsequently, this may be reflected in prevalence rates of sexual victimization being generally lower for males in comparison to females.""

A systematic review of the prevalence rates of sexual violence is conducted in this report, and the authors note that all of the studies reporting high male victimisation rates use BSQs (behaviourally specific questions) as opposed to non-BSQs which use more generic terms (e.g., ‚Äúrape,‚Äù ‚Äúsexual abuse,‚Äù ‚Äúsexual assault‚Äù) without further clarification. The authors assert that using BSQs is preferable partially because many male victims do not label their sexually unwanted experiences as rape. Not using BSQs may thus cause lower prevalence rates of sexual victimisation (especially among men), since reports of nonconsensual sex by victims who do not define their own experiences as sexual victimisation are not detected. They conclude ""it is recommended that future research should consistently use BSQs"".

[Forced-to-penetrate cases: Lived experiences of men](https://wp.lancs.ac.uk/forced-to-penetrate-cases/files/2016/11/Project-Report-Final.pdf)

""The majority of men did not report being compelled to penetrate a woman, either to the police or to friends and family. The reporting rate to the police of 1.7% is even lower than the reporting rate for women who have experienced serious sexual violence, which stands at around 15%. The extremely low reporting rate in compelled penetration cases suggests a clear lack of engagement by these men with the police and criminal justice process.""

Thus, data based on police reports likely understate male victimisation far more than it does female victimisation.

A study examining attitudes towards female and male rape victims among 240 UK medical students (120 females and 120 males) using the Attitudes Towards Rape Victims Scale (ARVS). Half of the participants received the female rape questionnaire (where the statements referred to female rape victims) and half of the participants received the male rape questionnaire (the questions were the same as on the female rape questionnaire but the focal victim in the statements was male).

The researchers found that ""Attitudes towards male rape victims ... were significantly more negative than attitudes towards female rape victims"".

This is an old study from 1996 (so the situation might have improved), but it is the only research study I am aware of which has sought to examine the provision of services to adult, noninstitutionalised male victims of sexual assault. This investigation found that many of the rape crisis providers and law enforcement agencies contacted held common stereotypes about male rape. The belief that men could not be raped or that they were raped only because they wanted to be was frequently endorsed. 

One law enforcement representative bluntly stated ""Honey, we don't do men"". She laughingly asked, ""What would you want to study something like that for? Men can't be raped."" Another law enforcement representative said ""Most males which are fondled or sodomized are males that want to be sodomized.""

In addition, more than one third (37%) of the agencies initially contacted reported that they would not provide services to a male victim because their crisis services were geared specifically toward the needs of women.

[Decisions and attitudes concerning child sexual abuse: does the gender of the perpetrator make a difference to child protection professionals?](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014521349800101X)

Here is a 1994 research paper. An investigation was conducted into whether child protection investigators, specifically social workers and the police, are as likely to take seriously a case of child sexual abuse if it had been perpetrated by a female rather than a male. What they found was that ""social services involvement and social services investigation were considered significantly more appropriate by male social workers if the perpetrator was male as opposed to female. Registration of incidents as cases of child sexual abuse was viewed as more appropriate by all participants as a group if abuse had been carried out by a man rather than a woman. Finally, imprisonment was viewed by all participants and, particularly, policemen as more appropriate for male perpetrators rather than female child sexual abusers."" The only finding of theirs that runs counter to the pro-female/anti-male biases here was that female social workers viewed prosecution of the perpetrator as more appropriate if the perpetrator was female than male.

I find this one uproariously funny. This is an article published in the journal ""Feminist Criminology"" attempting to examine the utility of the evil woman hypothesis by examining sentencing discrepancies between male and female sex offenders. They used National Corrections Reporting Program data to identify sex offenders for the years 1994 to 2004 and the sentences they received for specific sex offences.

The hypothesis for their study predicted that women would receive longer sentences than men for sex offences. And they did indeed find a significant difference in sentence length between men and women, but not in the direction they expected. Men received longer sentences for sex offences than women.

At least these researchers were honest about what they found. Few feminist researchers are.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i6sdli/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/,problem_redditor

2020-08-10 23:47:51,Male privilege is a myth. Here‚Äôs why.,"Women are actually suffering in the Middle East and Africa, with real inequality, but America is the place with problems that needs to be focused on. 

Men make up 99% of both combat and workplace deaths, but we need to fight for your ‚Äúright‚Äù to kill the baby you chose to put inside you. 

You‚Äôre not seen as a predator for holding your child‚Äôs hand at the park, but it‚Äôs a problem that you‚Äôre afraid to walk down the street at night (which is a problem, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but one not exclusive to females. Everyone is scared to walk down the street at night). 

It‚Äôs okay to ‚Äúteach boys not to rape‚Äù even though it‚Äôs the same mentality as ‚Äúteach black people not to do crime‚Äù   

Women get 95% of full custody verdicts, even if they‚Äôre a shitty parent, but god forbid a father gets praise for doing his daughter‚Äôs braids (something men don‚Äôt traditionally know how to do). 

You‚Äôre not legally obligated to register for the draft, but it‚Äôs sexism when you don‚Äôt get the same benefits men do because they registered. (And then you get these benefits regardless). 

There are hundreds of female-serving-only organizations (even for problems that affect men at a similar, or even higher, rate, more on this later) but when men have an organization that serves men only, it‚Äôs sexist and you need to be included (Boy Scouts). 

The only domestic abuse shelters and help centers serve women, and even bar men from entry, even though men are the victims of domestic abuse in nearly 50% of cases, and women the offenders in a nearly similar percentage. 

There are more female-only homeless shelters than both co-ed and men-only shelters, despite women only making up 25% of the homeless population. Shelterless men also make up a greater percentage of those without a shelter than their homeless percentage. 

The UN is biased incredibly towards women, only including women and children as victims of some tragedy, only offering food and aid to women and children in a humanitarian crisis, yet still claiming through their skewed gender inequality index that women are oppressed and unequal everywhere. 

In a domestic court case against you, you can claim sexual assault, violence, or threatening with no evidence and turn the tide of the case, and get everyone on your side. 

Men will lose their livelihoods over a false rape accusation with no evidence while the woman walks free, yet female teachers who are convicted (with evidence) of statutory rape or child rape get to KEEP their jobs, and no one ‚Äúcancels‚Äù them, ‚Äòthe kid enjoyed it‚Äô. 

If you make less money than men working in your building, even if you have an entirely different position and pay grade than them, you can claim sexism and the false wage gap narrative; forcing the manager to give you a raise under threat of lawsuit. 

Female behavior in schools is seen as the ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù, while male behavior is seen as problematic and needs to be corrected. Women will also get higher grades for the exact same work in schools. 

You don‚Äôt have to worry about being told to ‚Äúman up‚Äù whenever you cry or talk about your mental health issues. 

Your income never has to be ‚Äúfamily supporting‚Äù and in many cases money would not be a large factor in choosing a job, because the man is supposed to put food on the table. 

Women make up 80% of domestic spending, much of that coming out of their husband‚Äôs pockets to buy luxuries for themselves. 

Men are expected to blow thousands of dollars on a ring, just for you to decide whether to marry him or not. 

Men are almost always expected to make the risky first moves, AND pay for the date, ring and wedding if you decide to be so nice as to say yes. 

Because of this, the outcome of nearly every decision sexually, romantically, or monetarily is decided by you. Thus, You will always be happy with the outcome, whether it be turning down a date etc. 

It‚Äôs rape only towards the female if both parties are intoxicated, and not rape towards the male if the man is the only one intoxicated. 

It‚Äôs not rape because he ‚Äúhad a b*ner‚Äù and ‚Äúenjoyed it‚Äù despite you not knowing the full story, not even mentioning the fact that animalistic instincts does not equal consent. 

Women are expected and allowed to have good tasting, exotic, fruity drinks at bars, but when a man has anything other than a nasty beer, he‚Äôs gay. 

It‚Äôs sexism and patriarchy when men make up the majority of political seats, even though there‚Äôs nothing stopping women from running for office, AND when women make up the majority of the voting age population. 

But why are they oppressed and we‚Äôre privileged?",1.0,1.0,1.0,24.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i77b48/male_privilege_is_a_myth_heres_why/,PeddarCheddar11

Like an example is that boys are more likely to get in trouble at schools than girls are even if the girl is misbehaving more than the boy is. Also, I heard that  a study found that female teachers are likely to grade students tests lower when they knew the test taker was a boy.

And also, in movies and in TV shows and in other forms of fiction, male children are much more likely to be shown getting hurt or killed than female children are.

Hearing this from an MRA is mind blowing ! if you don't trust the media and the UN when they talk about gender issues in the west why you trust what they say about third world contries ??

Our life as men in africa is not a privilige. we have the same problems you face in then west. hight suicide rate, homlessness, paternity fraud, child support, family courts bias, male victims of domestic violence are ignored/mocked etc etc ...

Do women and girls face unique problems you don't in the west ? yes like child marriage. but we also have child labour that disproportionately affect boys.

Just 3 days ago i was watching on Algerian TV a man crying because he can't see his kids !! 

NO ! women are not oppressed. not even in Iran. both men and women have problems and issues. the media only show women's issues that's why we have the illution that women suffer more.

Stop spreading the feminist propaganda. i'm not defending islamic laws by the way i'm an atheist.

2020-08-11 21:09:49,Can the victim industry be defeated?,"The victim is always morally right, neither responsible nor accountable, and forever entitled to sympathy.

&gt;Victim means good business for attorneys and psychotherapists. The search for the cause and the person or circumstances to blame helps support hundreds of thousands of therapists.


&gt;The psychotherapeutic community adopted the blame approach back in the beginning of the 20th century with the birth of psychoanalysis. While originally the blaming finger was pointed primarily at mothers, later on it came to be pointed at men, racism, sexism, militarism, consumerism, the upper class, immigration, etc. The myth of the psychotherapeutic community is that somehow if one can identify a person or an event that supposedly caused the shortcoming, anxiety or depression, the condition will be improved. The result has been a huge waste of time, money and life in search of someone or something to blame rather than finding a way to improve life now and in the future.  https://www.zurinstitute.com/victim-psychology/#victims
 

The issue with the ""victim industry"" is, by defending a victim's right to stay angry, it insures the cycle of co-dependent treatment, never ends; however, the route cause could be that agreeing with the victim only feeds the anger to keep the victim feeling helpless, but doesn't help the victim to be empowered to move forward. I think a better approach may be anger management tactics to return the person to rational thoughts as a first step:  

&gt;Be careful of words like ""everything,"" ""never"" or ""always"" when talking about yourself or someone else. ""This !&amp;*%@ machine never works,"" ""why do I have to do everything myself"" or ""you're always forgetting things"" are not just inaccurate, they also serve to make you feel that your anger is justified and that there's no way to solve the problem. They also alienate and humiliate people who might otherwise be willing to work with you on a solution.   Don't say the first thing that comes into your head, but slow down and think carefully about what you want to say. At the same time, listen carefully to what the other person is saying and take your time before answering. https://www.apa.org/topics/anger/control

I saw it and realized it was me when I was about 5 or 6 standing outside the tub with bath toys completely naked. I was really embarrassed by the fact both my female cousins saw my genitals and tried to change the subject until my aunt interrupted and said she has another pic like that of me bathing with my female cousin that was my age and showed a picture of a little me in tub completely naked with my cousin sitting across from me was in a swimsuit. I felt humiliated knowing my privacy wasn't taken seriously and everyone is laughing at it but no one would dare take a picture of my cousin naked because she is a girl.

2020-08-12 09:55:50,Good sources on custody statistics,"Currently looking for good data on the custody battles.

I having personally gone through an abusive mother towards me and my divorced father, I'm finally coming to terms with it.

I'm in college currently so I've heard and experienced wilful ignorance from the feminists on campus and our major's club. Our major's club is the general club, and then we have a feminist club promoting women in STEM (something I agree with because we are a STEM major) but have had member's have blatant misandry with no repercussions.

A few of us men suggested starting a men's version of this and was immediately brought to the attention of the chair and we were threatened with pulling support/sponsorship from the general club if pushing for such a club. Granted at the time I had barely did much research truly facing men two or so years ago and was doing it more as a joke to balance out some very radical expressions from certain members of the club.

So getting to my point. Since this debacle the womans organization started changing their tone and now advertise that it is not just a womans club (even though it literally has the word women in the name) and the everyone is welcome. Now I'm a grad student and continue to have good relations with the current members of both clubs.

I brought up this issue over child custody to the womans club president as something the club can advocate for as a project, and she is very on board with the idea and appointed me to lead the project.

Any sources helpful, dont want any stone unturned. I've done some late night research into the topic so far and have come across some statistics that are alarming on law firm sites, but then kinda played off as ""father consent"" or not providing where the research was conducted. I'm not neccesarily using what people say on forums due to being anecdotal evidence on 50/50 cases, traveling without notice, etc but I am taking note on the amount of women posting compared to men and how they start describing the men as ""bastards"" and other colorful language (in which the comments of support are similarly worded and encourages them to do what it takes for dad to suffer) where as the male comments were just more frustrated at the system and not bashing the mom at all.

but, i'm just realizing. what if we're both right? what if we both discriminate against eachother, but in different ways? like what if on one end, women are discriminated against by pink tax, or whatever, and men are discriminated by women taking frustration out on men? then men attack back, and then that gives women a reason to attack back at men? or maybe something similar?

2020-08-13 01:15:06,reproductive rights legislation?,"If a dude has sex with a woman and uses a condom and then throws that condom in the trash, as far as I'm concerned that sperm in that condom is a part of the man's body and it therefore belongs to him and cannot be used in any way without his consent.  Furthermore, its presence in a condom indicates that he did not intend for that sperm to create a baby.  Therefore, if a woman secretly takes that condom out of the trash and impregnates herself with it, she's committed paternity fraud against him.  He should therefore never be forced to bear any responsibility for a resulting child.  In addition, her criminal actions against him indicate she's not fit for motherhood and should therefore lose custody of the child, which should then be placed into foster care and she should never be allowed any access to it.  

To me that's what would seem just, but our laws don't even remotely work like that.  If some underhanded woman wants to trap a man into fatherhood, she can do so by spermjacking.  The MBA had to actually warn its players against this crime that some women commit against wealthy men.  To be clear, I'm calling it a crime because it SHOULD be illegal, not because it is.  In reality there's no law against it.  It's actually legal to use a man's sperm against his consent to make a baby and then put him on the hook for it.  I don't know how there could be a more clear violation of a person's reproductive rights.  

It's also perfectly legal in many states for a woman to falsify on the birth certificate who the father is.  She could write down a man's name as the father whom she never even had sex with and that guy could end up on the hook.  This type of fraud should also be illegal.  It should also be mandatory that paternity information on birth certificates be verified via a paternity test.  

A man should have the right to know if he's a father.  And he should have the right to know if he's NOT a father, and as soon as possible.  If his wife slept around on him behind his back and got pregnant from that affair, her husband should have the right to know that as soon as possible.  Tricking him into thinking he's a father when he's not should also be a crime.  I've often been shocked by how some women view this type of betrayal as no big deal.  It's one of the most evil and cruel deceptions that a woman can play on a man.  

I would be in favor of some kind of constitutional amendment guaranteeing reproductive rights.  Men would be protected against all of the above in exchange for having some reasonable protections of women's reproductive rights.  But the feminists are NEVER for any kind of fairness for men.  They act like only women have ever been wronged.  If they want to protect a woman whose husband committed adultery against her, I'm fine with that, but then a man's reproductive rights should also be protected.  A man should be protected against spermjacking and other types of paternity fraud.",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i8hru0/reproductive_rights_legislation/,TigPlaze

2020-08-13 05:02:39,"If you are a woman and are earnest about wanting a serious relationship, never ever do what Tomi Lahren did","I'm actually throwing women a bone here because if that's the advice women get on a daily basis especially from feminist types when it comes to 'getting a man' it really is no fucking wonder dating is such a shit show currently and I honestly feel sorry for you. 

This may come as a shock to you but literally everyone has shitty experiences with the opposite gender. It really is not exclusive to women, men don't talk about it usually because we're not dumb enough to think that we're going to get an outpouring of sympathy online and we certainly don't scream it out to the entire world especially the people we're trying to attract that we clearly have major issues that we're not over yet.

I can tell you as a single guy never ever spew this shit over social media or on your dating profile of all things which I have seen. Do you know what you're telling guys even with the best intentions? You're basically saying, I have emotional and trust issues and I'm an extremely judgemental about men I've never even talked to on top of that. You think any guy is going to even approach you when you're that fucking hostile towards men and you openly admit it?

The worse thing Tomi Lahren did was when she got a backlash and not just from men I suspect is she doubled down and this is exactly what feminists do and started acting snarky and bitchy towards men pretending that they just couldn't handle her. She clearly thought she was making some kind of clever play and passing herself off as a hardcore bitch that men can't handle. No, this is called insecurity and again, you don't just spew that off all over social media and on your dating profiles because men are just going to go okay I won't date you then since you clearly decided to hate me from the beginning.

Seriously girls, I'm actually being nice for once in this topic and trying to look out for you. Everyone loves to screech about incels online but just like the women in FemaleDatingStrategy when you behave this way towards men you're basically telling any guy with any self-respect that you might actually want to date that you have a ton of red flags and issues from past relationships and hookups you aren't over yet.

Never ever take advice from feminists and other women who are bitter you are going to be sabotaging yourself. Take my advice, don't, it really isn't my job to be your therapist but don't say I didn't warn you but if I see that shit on Tinder and the like I'm immediately taking a pass and it's surprising how common women with a serious attitude problem towards men are on these sites.",1.0,1.0,1.0,64.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i8m6n8/if_you_are_a_woman_and_are_earnest_about_wanting/,Lethn

2020-08-13 06:23:54,Ex wife decides to quit her job to go to school. Judge takes away most of her Child support responsibilities.,"Have 2 kids, 14 and 11.   I have custody of both.   Ex-wife has decided she wants to be a nurse so she quit her high paying job and enrolled in school.   

She petitioned the court to lower her child support.  She was paying 575 a month.

The court lowered it to 55 a month.

This even after I could have petitioned 2 years ago to get it raised because they are now older and didnt.

55 a month for a teenager and a tween.  

She can work but chooses not to.   My brother broke his back and could not work for over a year.  The judge, same judge, would not lower his child support.

It gets even worse.   

When we went to trial the judge was being so nice to my ex and very rude to me.   Kept asking me question on why I want to go back to school and not pay for my kids.   I finally was able to tell her that it was my ex-wife that paid the support.    She looked at me and said ""oh, the mother is the one paying support.""   She immediately changed tone and told her how proud she was of her going to back to school to be a nurse.

2020-08-13 09:18:37,Beginning to feel the pressure of being the provider,"I moved with my grilfriend almost one year ago and I started to work to pay the rent and the food since she was about to finish her Master's degree. 

I was perfectly aware of what I was doing. I knew about men's issues and MRA for some years now. I perfectly knew that I was taking the role of provider. But it was and still is the best solution and it make us very happy. I don't want to complain about how men are often forced into the provider role since I knew what I was sacrifing (my own degree) but also what I was getting (a home with a lovely and loving girlfriend).

We often hear the feminist talking about the mental load of the women. And sure, it does exist and I wouldn't dare to deny it. But I just want to point out the mental burden of the men. Being the provider is at the same time a great pride and a great deal of fear and stress. I take a great pride in being the one who allow my gf and I to savor our shared life. 

But it has a price. The fear of my car breaking down and preventing me to go to work. (That actually happen today, that's why I felt like talking about all of this). The fear of not having enough money to overcome the hardships of life (like a car needing to be fixed on top of a rent to pay, the food...). The fear of loosing my job and loosing everything we built on the money I make. And finally the fear of losing my girlfriend. Not because she would left me because I wouldn't be anymore the provider. But because the lack of money increases stress, anger and all other negative emotions which can endangered even the most solid couple.

Even if I manage to talk a bit of this with her, I don't think she can understand the stress and the fears I felt. I'm scared to make a mistake at work, even to be late because I don't know what consequences it could have. Every time something is off (like a broken car, yeah i know, I repeat myself, sorry), I can't describe how awfull is the sensation of a freezing hand clinging on my guts. But even if she doesn't fully understand, she still stand by me and help me in any way she can like cooking when I come back home late. 

When we analyse our situation, it does seem like we take the traditionnel role, the prividing man and the woman at home. However, it is something we have both agreed and therefore it's not patriarchy or oppression. Just two persons who loved each other and who are willing to do what needs to be done to be together.

2020-08-13 17:39:51,Male and female bodies double standard,"So recently in mexico, a woman was livestreaming with her husband, who is a prominent senator in mexico apparently, and he called her out for ""showing too much of her leg"" since she was sitting on the floor, so she put her leg down, and the husband started saying that she is only for him since she is his wife. Following this there was some outrage, and women started posting pictures with the hashtag #yoense√±oloquequiera, roughly translated to ""I will show whatever i want"", these pictures usually show these women with very tight shorts or dresses, you get the idea. This situation has made me think about all the times I have heard a woman say something like "" if a man has too many shirtless posts on instagram i don't like him, he's showing off too much"" or anything along those lines.

2020-08-14 05:42:28,I find it infuriating that many feminists don‚Äôt apply the same logic to scenarios.,"Men are discriminated against in the court system. I know it, you know it but feminists won‚Äôt admit it because it shows an aspect of society where women have an advantage. 

I also know that people of colour are at a disadvantage in the court system, serving on average much longer sentences for the same crimes as White people. This is obvious discrimination and PoC. 

However, when this exact same reasoning is applied to show how men are disadvantaged (roughly serving more than double the sentence a women would get). Suddenly this reasoning is flawed and doesn‚Äôt account for the specifics of the crimes. 

Why does it hurt them so much to say that maybe, just maybe, Men have it worst in at least one aspect of society",1.0,1.0,1.0,34.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i98ynb/i_find_it_infuriating_that_many_feminists_dont/,jacobrennie1510

We had a party today, and this one girl proudly proclaimed that there is a contraceptive pill for men, with the same side effects as the female equivalent, but men were such pussies, so the male doctors didn‚Äôt want to commercialize it. Then all the females had this round of laughing and making jokes about how fragile men are.

This is not only wrong on a academic level, but it also shows the position of power and privledge that females hold when it comes to children and pregnancy, as well as the sheer ignorance of the consequneces a pregnancy can have for a guy. I personally would love to have a contraceptive, and i think a lot of other guys would to. I personally know people who either have children they pay for, who aren‚Äôt theirs, or they have never met their own chil, or they become dads way to early, or they have to take care of a child they never consented to having.

2020-08-14 14:45:38,I‚Äôm a woman who believed fathers rights were abused before my current partner ... but after what happened to him (the most insane story I have ever heard) ... well I still believe that. But more and stuff.,"So my current partner of five years (let‚Äôs call him A) has a baby with his ex wife (let‚Äôs call her C). But before the baby story let‚Äôs back up (not much) before then ... A was a smart kid (won contests for building robots, had straight As etc), athletic, a gamer... pretty well rounded kid and teen altogether. He joined the military at the worst possible time and managed to get sent into three overseas missions during the height of the Iraq/Afgan v US war. 

While he was in the military he met C. Know being a ridiculously caring person to a fault, A saw C ... someone who was strung out on white stuff, an alcoholic and general mess from an even messier family (more on that later) and took her in feeling sorry for her and then they dated and very very quickly after she got pregnant. 

So flash to him back overseas, dutifully sending all the money the military gave him straight to her and suddenly he gets word that his credit (which he and his dad had built up slowly and steadily since he was young) was shot, there was a credit card taken out and maxed out in his name and it was used to buy men‚Äôs clothing and other men‚Äôs ... stuff... C had used it to buy the boyfriend she was home cheating with whatever he wanted.

That was their first split. But A loved his newborn daughter more than life itself... so... she manipulated him back a few more times... and in between she managed to let her abusive boyfriends traumatize the toddler and she OD‚Äôd their daughter on cough syrup to get her to go to sleep and (as he found out later) attempted to get his brother to sleep with her then destroyed his relationship with his bro telling him a lot of untruths to keep them apart. 

But through the on and off while she was drunk and sniffing her brains out... who do you think raised their daughter? Changed her diapers? Watched movies with her? Tucked her into bed at night? Cooked meals for her? Told her stories? He did. And only he did. 

Then came the last split. This is where we come back to that family of hers. They were staying with family and A wakes up and can‚Äôt find C, he hears noises coming from C‚Äôs cousins room ... sexual noises... he walks in and finds them in the middle of having sex. Ew. So at this point he finally snaps and blacks out. He attacked the cousin in his rage. The dude survived he just attacked him with his fists. 

C and her family tried to have him charged with assault and manslaughter and the judge threw out the case due to the disgusting circumstances and some common sense and decency. This is the last court A would be in where he found that.

Enter family court.

A spent all his money and some from his family to get the best lawyer they could to fight for full custody (obviously) who would give custody to a drug addict, alcoholic, serial cheater who slept with her cousin and had abusive boyfriends around their little daughter while drugging her up and nearly killing her? New York family court that‚Äôs who. Despite the case being dismissed and the circumstances they argued that because he attacked his daughters uncle when her mother was right there combined with his military training and background he was a ‚Äúdanger to his daughter‚Äù the daughter he raised, cared for and protected from her mothers crazy behavior... he was granted visitation with supervision. 

That was not obeyed. 

Should he have fought that harder? Sure. Should he have not blacked out in a rage? Absolutely if he could have controlled it. There is a lot he shouldn‚Äôt have done following this but they all have one thing in common... he isn‚Äôt a calculating sociopath , he is a sensitive and caring person who loves his daughter more than himself and that makes him act irrationally emotionally sometimes.  

So C began a process of dangling video calls and visits with his daughter in front of him to get gifts and money beyond child support (claiming her new abusive boyfriend beat her up and stole her child support card) ... get what she wanted... and never let him see his daughter. She did the same with his mother with the same promises of video calls for her and A which never happened. Eventually A just got fed up of paying child support, money on the side and never seeing his daughter.

He had PTSD from the military and probably worse from that and he just fell into depression and anxiety and traveled around for awhile doing a job here or there but not really much and thinking of his daughter every day since the last day he saw her (ten years ago when she was four). 

C hid both herself and her daughter online and everywhere else and he would hear nothing for years till she would pop up and do the same thing. He was in arrears so she would take money from every job he did work... while she had a new 50-60 k a year nursing job and the man his daughter would grow to call dad had a good job as well. 

Then he stopped believing her. And so she did something truly sick. She called his mother claiming his daughter had been asking questions and wanted to speak to him and she could no longer stop her. So he warily (out of sheer desperation that it might be true) followed along and let her berate him and took it and let her be rude and lie to his face and took it hoping it would this time lead to an actual conversation. And it did. His daughter spoke to him on the phone. In a very short sentence answer, cold type of way that he didn‚Äôt really notice because he was crying tears of joy their first few conversations and she would say ‚Äúgotta go here‚Äôs my mom‚Äù and they would text through her (probably C not the daughter) and both mom and daughter only brought things back to money ... she broke her EarPods, she wanted this, her bag was stolen with the $500 he just sent her for her trip, the airline wouldn‚Äôt refund them during Covid ... he had recently had a job and they‚Äôd been getting payments that way ... but he lost it during the pandemic and did not hesitate to send 500 , 200 , 300 , another few 500s till it was everything he had because this was his daughter, finally talking to him.... his dream come true. 

And when she asked ‚Äúwhere have you been?‚Äù Or called the man her mom is with ‚Äúdad‚Äù did A tell her the truth? Everything above? Did he want to ? Yes. Did he? No. Because he loved her more than he loved himself and it would hurt her to know. Something her mother didn‚Äôt seem to worry about. Anyway C cut him off again from his daughter saying she changed her mind and wanted to not talk for awhile but send money. He had enough and already paid her everything... which by the way she claimed she was told by child support she could claim as that and he didn‚Äôt need to go through them because they would just take some away from what it was meant for... so he just wrote ‚Äúfor child support‚Äù on all the Zelle Transfer‚Äôs ... she also claimed if he lifted the passport lock on her so they could travel (he had it in place since way back when they had a lawyer). Now hearing this did I have a bad feeling on both fronts? Yes. Did I want to destroy his happiness? No. Did I still warn him to pay through the system and wait on sending the passport forms till she followed through and did what she could to terminate the child support order? Yes. Did he listen while being on cloud nine talking to his daughter? Not really no. He wanted his daughter to be able to travel even if he couldn‚Äôt because of arrears. 

So back to her cutting him off from their now 14 year old daughter after draining him dry ... she then proceeded to sue him for the missing months of child support (that she claimed to have filed what he gave her as). Now see A is no longer too emotional to think clearly. He is ready for custody, enforcing the visitation, a long overdue modification of child support and with text record and bank statement evidence of her committing welfare fraud while using her daughter to do so...

2020-08-14 19:26:38,Is virgin shaming just a coping mechanism? How many people with multiple ex-partners actually liked who they slept with? Are they just taking it out on people who aren't as generally promiscuous as they are?,"To quote Tim Pool when he talked about men not wanting to date career women who are often feminists I am a glutton for punishment and didn't learn my lesson the first time when I started talking about dating in my other topic.

I'm pretty upfront about the fact that I'm a virgin at 30 and I want to be extremely clear about my beliefs. I am not a 'tradcon' ( traditional conservative ) in any sense of the word, I am a Voluntaryist and I just have a talent of finding the most forbidden topics possible and pushing peoples' buttons. So when I'm talking about this stuff don't take it as a personal attack on your own sex history I'm just curious because I've been wondering this about people who generally try to virgin shame guys online so aggressively. I'm bringing this up because I have a theory about whether or not the most aggressive virgin shamers are the ones with the most ex-partners.

Girls and guys alike feel free to chime in on this because I know it may well vary by gender and so on. How many of you especially those who have quite a few ex-partners even liked the people you were sleeping with? The reason I bring this up is because I've been pretty stumped myself sometimes learning about peoples' dating history where some of them bring up a crazy amount of ex-boyfriends or ex-girlfriends I think even by most peoples' standards and I because I can't help myself I thought do any of them by any chance regret going through that many people?

Maybe it's because I'm a virgin and I just don't get it I understand the concept of a casual hookup. I actually wouldn't mind that and it would probably be a pretty positive experience for me if it was all mutual which is why I'm very clear about not being a tradcon or anything but given the sheer number of ex-partners I've heard some people having I can't believe for a second that over the time period they're talking about that they actually liked all of those people and felt some kind of connection.

There's a scientific basis by the way for me thinking about this. Human beings according to biology apparently have a hard limit they are set to for their true stable friendships and social connections and I think this could very easily apply to relationships as well which may explain why people with lots of ex-partners might be so hostile to the idea of virgin men especially feminists and the like who are pretty widely known for going through men like crazy.

Also I hadn't realised there was proper name for this phenomenon and it's called Dunbar's number.",1.0,1.0,1.0,53.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i9k7my/is_virgin_shaming_just_a_coping_mechanism_how/,Lethn

2020-08-14 21:03:10,"Ideological appropriation, and how it is used by feminists","Ideological Appropriation is where a person or group takes a common, basic, or universal ideological concept and attempts to claim a substantial degree of authority and/or ownership over it.

It is typically done in an attempt to gain clout, power, and/or respect.

For example, feminists often try to appropriate the concept of equality. Before I realised this and was able to express it adequately, I found encounters with ""preachy"" or evangelical feminists very bemusing and difficult to fully understand.

Since the ideological concept that's being appropriated may be widely supported and valued by regular people, those appropriating it are attempting to create a psychological dilemma in the minds of others: if the group's claim to authority is true, people must support the group and attempt to gain membership in it, or instead they must abandon their support for the desirable concept. Even worse, they cannot oppose or criticise the group without also being seen to oppose or criticise the desirable concept.

A common technique used to stake a claim of authority over a concept is to engage in linguistic semantics. Firstly, create a term to refer to your group and the ideology that you hold. Then, argue that the real definition of your group's term, is simply that it refers to those who adher to and support the desirable concept.

This works especially well when the group's ideology is related to the appropriated concept in some way.

If the group cannot convince an outsider that membership of their group is inexorably linked to the appropriated concept, they can fall back on a second technique: argue that failure to support the group will lead to significant harm being inflicted upon the concept.

Feminism consists of a primary, core belief that true equality for women in (Western) society is yet to be achieved. Alongside this basic tenet, is a set of supporting beliefs regarding the extent of said inequality, its causes, and the actions required to end it.

However, some feminists have beliefs that many would disagree with (""women are massively oppressed in western society""), and they use concepts and terms that might be considered crude, simplistic, or derogatory (e.g. ""toxic masculinity"", ""patriarchy"", ""mansplaining"", ""manspreading""). This results in a lot of people being uncomfortable with identifying as a feminist.

A key desire for some feminists is to get society to view women, on the whole, as a group that has been wronged by men and is owed restitution - perhaps in the form of special treatment or privileges. Other feminists may want people to view them as being wonderfully virtuous, or they have a deep seated need to believe that they're more virtuous than the average person. Some, being unable to make real change in the world like curing a disease, inventing something, or becoming an expert in an important field, see feminism as an easy, automatic route to attaining at least some of that level of prestige (I doubt Emma Watson would get to speak in front of the UN, merely in her role as the actress from the Harry Potter movies).

It's this desire for clout, power, and respect that leads feminists to appropriate the idea of equality. Since feminism tries to use the abstract concept of ""equality"" as its basis, feminists can easily use linguistic semantics to achieve the appropriation.

The steps feminism uses to appropriate the concept of equality:

1. Define a term to refer to their group and its ideology (feminists/feminism).

2. Attempt to force the term on the public at large by evangelizing and using peer pressure (""Are you a feminist? Why not?"").

3. Argue that ""feminism"" is simply just a word for people who believe in equality (""If you believe women and men should be treated equally, then you're a feminist!""; ""Feminism is just the 'radical' idea that women are human beings!"")

4. The public either has to express support and appreciation for feminism, or be considered as ""anti-equality"" and thus deserving of contempt and potentially even harassment.

5. If someone rejects the idea that feminism == equality, they argue instead that you are harming equality in some way by withholding support to feminists - perhaps by claiming you will embolden misogynists, or discourage people from speaking against inequality.

There is also perhaps a reverse form, where they take an undesirable quality or concept, and attempt to force it upon groups who oppose them. An obvious example of this is trying to define Men's Rights as being fundamentally misogynistic. If successful, this discourages people from being associated with anything connected to Men's Rights, in fear of being labelled a misogynist.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i9ljyt/ideological_appropriation_and_how_it_is_used_by/,GordonColeSaysWHAT

This is somebody who I only know of thruu a friend and I wouldn't call us anything more than vague acquaintances

apparently she has issues and I'm not the first person that she is had issues with. think of a white trash crazy Ex-Girlfriend idea of how she iss

only without the ex-girlfriend part.
and I see her now and then because the people I know some of them know her and we sometimes end up at the same events..

 anyway she violently attacked me and then tripped me on the ground scraping me up so there was blood.

there were people around and I didn't want to hit her back so instead I called the police full arrived while she was still there and they could clearly see what happened and there were witnesses everywhere and not only did they not interview any witnesses but they didn't even attempt to even detain her for any amount of time. They basically let her walk away and go home they didn't even look at her..

I told him I specifically wanted to press charges for assault and because it was clear that she would probably attack me if she saw me again I asked them about filing a restraining order..

not only did they refuse to press charges but they were even reluctant about filing a report. and tried to give me the runaround about filing a restraining order. I'm going to try to pursue that but I'm not really sure how I would love help..

it's very blatantly clear that the reason the police didn't take this attack seriously was because it was a female attacking a male and if they absolutely would have taken it far more seriously and probably place someone in handcuffs if it had been a Man attacking a woman.

even more context we are about the same size and weight. it's not like this was some tiny for 5 foot 2 woman attacking a six foot two 250 pounds man. same size and weight..

so you can't even use that excuse. I guarantee you though if it had been the other way around they would have taken it very seriously but it's very clear that they didn't take it seriously or even want to do anything because it was a woman attacking a man..

unfortunately I can't really prove that because that's not specifically what they said. So I'm hoping that somebody here might be able to help? Give me some tips on what I can do to avoid this. maybe tips on how to press charges or at least file some kind of restraining order? she clearly has issues and a tendency towards violence I'm worried that it could happen again..

If there was literally no effort, or no anti-male sentiment at any point in 'real' feminism, then how come there even is a group (allegedly a minority but arguably a significant portion who would wear the identity) of feminists that absolutely, demonstrably do hate men? How would it be possible for it to come about?

Sure the Nazi's misinterpreted Nietzsche etc. but many historians I've heard claim it was intact irresponsible and incendiary. Is this the case with feminism or is there an agenda? Why does the overlap exist?

The thing is that annoys me, is that now there's this huge branch of feminists who act like they are the reasonable ones, that because they've highlighted a few key men's problems and put them in their sidebar and are therefore actually promoting genuine two-sided gender equality. 

The thing is, their foundational presumptions, their cornerstone philosophies are inherently anti-man. If you pick apart anything they say at the most basic level, it's misandristic. Why can I not even ask questions to challenge their beliefs? Why is every conversation met with hostility and vitriol?  

The emotion of anger and hate is raw with these people, I question to what level it is even based at thought and what level it is some sort of energetic resonance type thing. Not saying women are overly emotional, just that somehow the public feminists have some sort of rallying cry. They pitch this product of self-empowerment and equality (positive things) which piques some people's interest and then feed them this super inflammatory narrative. It's like you have to feel angry or disempowered in the first place to even seek out that sort of thing, and then it's just fuel to the fire.

THE CHARGES HAVE BEEN DISMISSED!!

First and foremost, I want to thank this community. In December when I wrote my original post I was at my wits end.  My life was falling apart and I was having suicidal thoughts. At that time I had no one to talk to and felt completely alone. The outpouring of support lifted a massive weight from me. Many of you messaged me directly to express your concern, offer help, or share your similar stories. I honestly believe posting here on r/mensrights may have saved my life. One user, in particular, was a massive help. He contacted me via DM and told me he had gone through something similar quite recently. He was kind enough to tell me his real name, and a simple google search brought his sexual assault case up immediately. He gave me his number and spoke with me on the phone for several hours, which eventually lead to me hiring the same attorney.  The attorney‚Äôs name is Antoinette O‚Äôneill, and if any of you find yourself, or someone you know in the situation I was in, I can‚Äôt recommend her enough. [https://parlatorelawgroup.com/content/antoinette-quinn-oneill](https://parlatorelawgroup.com/content/antoinette-quinn-oneill).  

The amount of sexism and discrimination I felt through this whole process can‚Äôt be properly related in a reddit post. The US Military has essentially given women a get out of jail free card when it comes to sexual assault allegations, however absurd those accusations may be. My accuser has been protected at all costs. The ‚Äúinvestigators‚Äù tore apart my life. They interviewed co-workers, acquaintances, ex-girlfriends, friends, etc. Anyone who they felt would help them prove my guilt, they spoke to. When I was originally informed of the accusation, I was told it was the investigators job to find the truth, to collect facts, and allow JAG to take things from there. When I received the Results of Investigation Report, or ROI, what stuck out immediately is investigators never once interviewed any of the ‚Äúvictims‚Äù friends, family, co workers, ex-boyfriends, etc. They never attempted to ascertain the validity of her claims. She told a minimum of a dozen people about the assault, including her chain of command, and not a single one of them was interviewed. They simply came at me from every conceivable angle. They interviewed people I had not seen or spoken to in YEARS. The sad truth is, if they had investigated her absurd claims, they would have discovered the truth in a short amount of time. Instead, the process took a full YEAR to complete because they never once attempted to confirm a single aspect of her story. As an example, she claimed that she could not accurately place where the sexual assault occurred. She simultaneously claimed to have used a ride share app to leave my residence and travel home. Those two statements together make zero sense. Yet they never once asked her to show the ride share app receipt, history, or contact the ride share app company for documentation of the travel. HOW IN THE FUCK DID THEY NOT ASK THAT SIMPLE OF A QUESTION!? That should have been extremely easy to produce if the statement was true. If they had, her entire story would have begun to fall apart. It was absolutely infuriating.   They interviewed anyone they could find I had contact with to see if I had ""confided"" in them about ""what I did"".  Their exact words when interviewing one of my friends.  Meanwhile, they didn't interview a single one of her friends to see if she had confided in them about the assault or any of the lies she told.  How the fuck is that not discriminatory?

After a full year of no word and my administrative hold, I was informed that JAG felt they had enough probable cause to charge me with the sexual assault, among other more minor crimes associated with the assault, and we moved onto the Article 32 hearing. This is where my attorney embarrassed the prosecution and easily ripped their remarkably weak case apart. For those unfamiliar, the Article 32 is sort of a pre trial for military members, which a 3rd party official oversees the charges and decides on their validity before proceeding to court martial. Since I refused to speak with law enforcement without an attorney, it was my first opportunity to refute the charges, show any evidence I have in my defense if I so chose too. The officiating officers‚Äô job is to analyze both sides and decide what charges should be taken to court martial.   Due to COVID very few people were physically present in the room. It was mainly done through video teleconference. The prosecution attempted to explain and justify their bullshit charges, which included a lot of ‚Äúummm ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúand rifling through paperwork to answer questions from the officiate. It was obvious they were ill prepared and inexperienced. When it came time for Toni to speak, she ripped their case apart in a matter of minutes without once looking at notes, needing to look up or reference precedent etc. She flat out embarrassed them, and in that moment, I knew she was worth every single penny I had to pay for her representation. Afterwards, I realized how I must have looked on camera while Toni was ripping them apart, cause I was staring at her in awe of her abilities. I was being charged with a life ending crime and I had a giant shit eating grin on my face watching my attorney work. It‚Äôs one thing to be told someone is good at their job, but seeing it happen in real time was impressive to say the least. A couple weeks after the Article 32 ended we received the report from the officiate. My favorite line was, which was written by a female officiate in a sexual assault case, ‚ÄúThis case, borderline, meets the low legal standard for probable cause, but likely would not if there was the ability to cross examine the victim and witnesses‚Äù. It was explained to me the only thing necessary for a sexual assault allegation to meet probable cause is a reputable accuser. That is it. If the court believes the girl that made an accusation is of sound mind and body, and the accusation sounds possible, they have probable cause to bring charges to court martial. For my case, they said it met the low legal standard, barely, but would not if my attorney had been able to cross examine the victim or witnesses during the article 32. AKA a good attorney would have easily been able to rip her story apart if given the opportunity to question her about her absurd claims.  Later on in the report, she literally expressed (in big legal terms) that she didn‚Äôt believe the victims accusations, that multiple aspects of her story were contradictory, and most importantly, she directly benefited from the accusation which caste significant doubt on the validity of her statements. Furthermore, JAG and investigators never even proved that they had jurisdiction to investigate the claim or prosecute me. How‚Äôs that for some shit. A year of hell and nobody even checked to see if they were in their legal right to do anything. Some real high IQ‚Äôs in the legal office. After the report was published, it went up the chain. Nearly two months later I got a phone call from my attorney letting me know all charges were being dropped. No explanation on why they were, but it is not difficult to figure out. After more than a year of hell, I get a nice fancy letter signed by a general and get told to move on with my life. 

Unfortunately, in the time since then I know it is not over for me. I find that my fear and anxiety over being helpless and discriminated against has slowly turned to pure anger of the injustice of it all. She has suffered zero consequences, and more than likely won‚Äôt. The common line I‚Äôm getting from people who were informed of the situation is, ‚Äújust move on.‚Äù But I can‚Äôt.  I used to lie awake at night in fear of going to prison for something I didn't do.  Having everything I've worked for my entire life gone at the word of a bitch trying to save herself.  Now, I lie awake at night knowing she got everything she wanted.  She and I still wear the same uniform.  She gets to walk around knowing she won. 

I‚Äôm considering filing a defamation of character or libel civil suit against my accuser. Her actions cost me a great deal of money, damaged my career, and to say my mental health and personal relationships have suffered is an understatement. On top of all that, the military has no way of expunging charges. For the rest of my life, when an employer runs my background check, they will see a sexual assault arrest and charge on my record. That is never going to go away.  Part of me is disappointed this didn‚Äôt go to court martial, and so was my attorney. We had so much evidence of my innocence, which is rare in sexual assault accusations, that she was looking forward to calling her out on all her lies on the witness stand. The charges may have been dropped, but since they were dropped without prejudice, the door remains open. It wasn‚Äôt an admittance that I am innocent, it was an admittance that they knew they weren‚Äôt going to get a conviction with the bullshit case they had presented. Proving she lied in court would have made me feel exonerated, instead, I just feel angry.  

If anyone has any legal resources, or a civil attorney I can have a consult with I ‚Äòd appreciate any suggestions. My accuser and I are both military, and we are now in different states then when this all began. I don‚Äôt‚Äô even know what state I‚Äôm supposed to file the law suit in. The state the accusation was made, the state I reside, or the state she resides? I don‚Äôt want to let the cat out of the bag just yet, but I will say I can prove she lied, and actually committed a felony while doing so. She made sworn statements in court, in front of a judge, which were complete fabrications, and I can prove it. We had all this prepared for the court martial to confront her in person. I‚Äôm hoping this leverage will aid the resolution of a civil suit, because if the military found out they would prosecute her, she would be discharged and possibly face jail time. I want justice, and you are all more than welcome to come along for the ride.  Again, Thank you all so much. You helped save me, and I am grateful.",1.0,1.0,1.0,204.0,/r/MensRights/comments/i9wxaa/update_ive_been_falsely_accused_of_sexual_assault/,DrShakyHandz

2020-08-16 21:52:39,Male rejection vs. Female rejection?,"A question I‚Äôve been sitting on for a while and I wanted your honest opinions on. 

Do you feel like there is a difference between a woman rejecting a man and a man rejecting a woman? 

I‚Äôve seen a lot of posts from friends and acquaintances pass by about being rejected and to me it feels a lot like men should deal with it if a woman changes their mind about not wanting to date etc. (which is completely fair ofcourse) but I also see a lot of stories from women where when a man rejects them or tells them no, they‚Äôre made out to be fuckboys or that they‚Äôre leading them on and what not. Almost like it feels that it‚Äôs harder to say ‚Äòno‚Äô as a man? 

So I‚Äôm genuinely curious and I want to hear your stories and if YOU feel like there is a difference between the two.

2020-08-16 22:50:02,Clearly recognizable,"In the past week of reading and responding on this sub, a jarring thought kept lingering in my head. That thought turned into an unavoidable question. Why doesn't MENS right have an easily recognizable and well defined  name/title. Organizationally Mens rights seems very unorganized and scattered. And I highly believe thats why people on the other side don't take mens rights movement and activist seriously. The feminist womens right movement has a overwhelming overbearing presence.  You say feminist and people automatically have  and understand a basic idea of what that means, and who the person is. And I say basic,  because we as Men know that there are many many feminist subgroups. Our causes are serious and deserve the proper respect. But it is hard for  mainstream society to take us seriously and want to even hear us if we are collectively unorganized and nounited under one clear, well defined, and easily recognizable banner. Yes there can be as many different sub groups as there are issues, but one general name/banner, mission statement for the movement as hole will go a long way towards ling term mainstream acceptance.",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iatm7n/clearly_recognizable/,4Ri3S6l4ckH34Rt13

**Studies demonstrating roughly gender parity in sexual assault victimisation**

[Prevalence of dating partner violence and suicidal ideation among male and female university students worldwide](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18984509/)

This 2008 worldwide survey of nearly 16,000 university students from 22 sites in 21 countries found that ""Male and female students were remarkably similar in the proportion of those who... reported being a victim of sexual coercion"" in their dating relationships. In 10 of the 22 sites (India, Israel, Korea, Singapore, Australia, Germany, Greece, Portugal, Sweden, and the US), a higher proportion of men compared to women reported sexual coercion. In another 6 of these sites (Brazil, Canada, Switzerland, UK, China, Netherlands) rates for women were higher, but the difference was not very large at all (amounting to only a few percentage points). Sexual coercion is defined rather broadly in the survey, and likely includes things outside of ""forced intercourse"".

[Men's self‚Äêreports of unwanted sexual activity](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224498809551398)

Here is a 1998 study investigating men's experience with unwanted sexual activity. The authors developed a questionnaire asking if respondents had ever engaged in unwanted sexual activity for any of 51 reasons. This questionnaire was administered to 507 men and 486 women. They found that more women (97.5%) than men (93.5%) had experienced unwanted sexual activity whereas more men (62.7%) than women (46.3%) had experienced unwanted intercourse.

Most of the people who experienced unwanted intercourse did so for reasons which would not qualify as rape (i.e. due to peer pressure, verbal coercion, etc). However, a smaller proportion of people reported experiencing unwanted intercourse for reasons that might fall under the definition of rape, most notably unwanted intercourse due to violent physical coercion, unwanted intercourse due to being too intoxicated to stop the other person, and unwanted intercourse due to the other person getting the subject drunk and taking advantage of the situation.

Rape due to physical force was quite rare: a very small percentage of the sample reported unwanted intercourse due to violent physical coercion and more women than men reported this form of victimisation, with 1.4% of men and 2.7% of women reporting it.

However, far more common was rape due to intoxication, and in this category there were no significant gender differences. There were no significant differences between the proportion of men and women who reported unwanted intercourse due to being too intoxicated to stop the other person: 12.2% of men and 13.2% of women reported this. Similarly, there were no significant differences between the proportion of men and women who reported unwanted intercourse due to the other person getting the subject drunk and taking advantage of the situation, which was reported by 11.8% of men and 10.7% of women.

[History of childhood abuse in Portuguese parents](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8513360_History_of_childhood_abuse_in_Portuguese_parents)

Here is a 2004 study which examines the self-reported prevalence of childhood physical and sexual abuse in a large sample of Portuguese parents. Nearly 1,000 parents (506 mothers and 426 fathers) were selected through public primary schools from the Northern area of Portugal. All completed the Portuguese version of the Childhood History Questionnaire (CHQ). The main question was: ‚ÄúAs a child, did you receive any the following from one of your parents or another adult before you were 13?‚Äù However, data was collected for abuse that happened after the age of 13 as well.

Sexual abuse was defined to cover four abusive behaviours: ‚Äúinappropriate touching, sexual fondling, intercourse/rape, and exhibitionism/flashing.‚Äù The prevalence of sexual abuse did not differ much by sex: 2.7% of the women and 2.6% of the men reported experiencing sexual abuse. 2% of the women and 1.8% of the men were abused before 13.

They do not break it down by category of sexual abuse because ""low prevalence limits further analysis"".

[Psychometric Properties of Revised Conflict Tactics Scales: Portuguese Sibling Version (CTS2-SP)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10896-013-9530-0)

This 2013 study uses a modified version of the CTS2 to survey participants' perpetration and sustaining of psychological aggression, physical aggression, sexual coercion and injury in their relationships with their siblings. Half of the items (39) are about the perpetration of conflict tactics from the participant toward the sibling and the other 39 items are concerned with the participant‚Äôs victimisation of conflict tactics from his/her sibling.

In a sample of 692 Portuguese university students, 10% of the men and 6% of the women reported sustaining at least one instance of sexual coercion from a sibling.

[Reported child sexual abuse in Bahrain: 2000-2009](https://www.annsaudimed.net/doi/full/10.4103/0256-4947.83218)

This is a descriptive study about child sexual abuse in Bahrain. It is based on a retrospective review of the Child Protection Unit (CPU) medical records of child sexual abuse cases evaluated over the last ten years, from 2000-2009. It included all children from birth to younger than 18 years of age who were evaluated by the CPU for sexual abuse, though ""\[c\]ases that had signs and symptoms indicative of diseases mimicking child sexual abuse were excluded.""

The number of children diagnosed exposed to CSA was 440, and 222 (50.5%) were males and 218 (49.5%) were females. They note that ""Male and female victims are almost equal in number"".

**High rates of female perpetration**

[Sexually Aggressive Women: Current Perspectives and Controversies](https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Sexually_Aggressive_Women.html?id=EwWSXYqtmk4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)

Here is a survey from 1998 by Peter B. Anderson which found extremely high rates of sexual aggression in a sample of 461 women (on page 88 to 89 of the source).

Many of the women reported using abusive (but non-violent) strategies to obtain sexual contact with a man. These strategies were: using your position of power or authority (reported by 26.5% of women), getting him drunk or drugged (reported by 36.5% of women) and taking advantage of a man while he was in a compromising position (reported by 30.6% of women).

A staggering proportion of women used much more violent means, however. Approximately 20% (1 in 5) of the women reported using physical force, 27% (more than 1 in 4) reported using the threat of physical force, and 9% (almost 1 in 11) reported using a weapon to obtain sexual contact with a male partner.

[Experiences With Dating Aggression and Sexual Coercion Among Polish College Students](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260507307651)

In this 2008 study, dating aggression and sexual coercion was studied in Polish college women and men using the Revised Conflict Tactics Scales (CTS2). Data was gathered on the proportion of men and women reporting their own perpetration of sexual aggression, as well as the proportion of men and women reporting perpetration of sexual aggression by their partners.

While there was a larger sex difference in men and women's reports of their partners' perpetration of sexual aggression, self-reports of one's own perpetration of sexual coercion did not differ much by sex. 42% of men and 40% of women reported engaging in sexually coercive behaviours. A much smaller minority, 4% of men and 6% of women, reported engaging in severe sexual coercion. The authors note with regards to severe sexual coercion ""It is important to recall that these behaviors meet legal standards for sexual assault (rape) in Poland"". Chi-square analysis found no differences between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs reports of their own sexually coercive behaviors.

[Denial, Minimization, Partner Blaming, and Intimate Aggression in Dating Partners](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260507301227)

Here is a 2007 study investigating intimate aggression towards a dating partner. Participants in the current study were 62 male and 77 female students from a large university located in southwestern Ontario. The CTS2 was used to survey participants. Sexual abuse was broken down into ""minor"" (3 items; e.g., ‚ÄúI made my partner have sex without a condom‚Äù) and ""severe"" forms (4 items; e.g., ‚ÄúI used force \[like hitting, holding down, or using a weapon\] to make my partner have sex with me‚Äù).

15% and 7% of male students reported perpetration of minor and severe sexual coercion, respectively. Rates of sexual abuse perpetration were higher among female students, with 20% and 11% of female students reporting minor and severe forms of sexual coercion respectively.

[Association of Sexual Violence and Human Rights Violations With Physical and Mental Health in Territories of the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/186342)

Even when it comes to conflict-related sexual violence (which is assumed to be mostly perpetrated by men), a very large proportion of conflict-related sexual violence is in fact perpetrated by women.

Here is a 2010 study attempting to survey the prevalence of sexual violence and other human rights violations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Rates of reported sexual violence were 39.7% among women and 23.6% among men. Of those who were exposed to sexual violence, 74.3% of women and 64.5% of men were exposed to conflict-associated sexual violence.

The surprising finding here is that women were reported to have perpetrated a surprisingly high proportion of the conflict-related sexual violence. Women were the perpetrators of conflict-related sexual violence in 41.1% of female cases and 10.0% of male cases.

**Studies showing gender parity in both victimisation and perpetration**

[Depression and intimate partner violence among college students in Iran](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1876201816303082)

In this Iranian data from the International Dating Violence Study (IDVS) 2001‚Äì2006 (ICPSR 29583) were analyzed. Twenty-three male and 75 female college students were selected in the IDVS Iranian data. The lifetime prevalence of sexual IPV victimization was 43.5% for men and 49.3% for women. The lifetime prevalence of sexual IPV perpetration was 43.5% for men and 46.7% for women.

**The majority of men who rape women are sexually abused by women in childhood**

[Heterosexual Molestation of Children Who Later Became Rapists](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2466/pr0.1984.54.3.810)

This is a report of a serendipitous finding from another study of childhood heterosexual molestation of men who were incarcerated as adults for rape. Subjects were 83 men in a medium security penitentiary who had been convicted of raping women at least 17 years of age. They found that forty-nine (59%) of the rapists had been heterosexually molested.

[The Male Survivor](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=DoQ5DQAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s)

""Briere and Smiljanich (1993) administered Koss and Oros's Sexual Experiences Survey (SES) and found that sexually abused men were significantly more likely than nonabused men to report having had sexual intercourse with a woman against her will either because they 'became so sexually aroused \[they\] could not stop \[themselves\]' or 'by pressuring her with continual arguments'. Briere and Smiljanich reason that their childhood experiences modeled aggression in sexual relationships and conditioned sexual arousal to coercive or aggressive behavior. (It seems reasonable to suspect that childhood sexual abuse would also model a lack of impulse control and ability to delay or deny gratification.) Briere and Smiljanich also noted that those who experienced their own abuse as something they had minimal control over were most likely to be sexually aggressive. They view rape and other sexual offenses as a maladaptive attempt to master or gain control over the trauma.""

""Freeman-Longo (1986) focused on connections between sexual abuse and later sexually abusive or aggressive behavior. Based on his work with sexually abused sex offenders, he argues that 1) the offender's offense(s) are a replication of what happened in his sexual victimization; 2) the offender's offense(s) are an anger reaction to his sexual victimization; or 3) the offender's offense(s) are a modelling of his sexual victimization because his personal and/or misinterpreted view(s) of his victimization was that it was not that harmful to him, that there were pleasurable aspects of it, and in some cases it was thought of as sexually arousing.""

""Freeman-Longo emphasizes the enormous amounts of anger, pain and frustration experienced by the men he studied. He states that they are unable to deal with feelings for fear of becoming vulnerable to others. They often possess tremendous hatred toward their abuser and a desire to retaliate against him or her. At the same time they feel vulnerable towards their abuser and may feel in his or her control. They tend to experience themselves as having a lack of power and control in their lives; powerlessness is among the most dominant features of their psychology. Sexual assaults are attempts to regain power and control by sexually abusing others.""

""Freeman-Longo found two features to be critical risk factors for the repetition of sexual abuse: (1) victimization by more than one perpetrator on separate occasions, (2) abuse that occurs repeatedly over a long period of time. His theory, that the offender's offenses replicate his own victimization, gains some support from the findings of other studies of convicted sex offenders. Groth (1979b) found that rapists (of women) are more likely to have been victimised by females in childhood, whereas child molesters were more often abused by males. Petrovich and Templer (1984) found that 59% of convicted rapists had been molested by females during childhood and that the majority of this abuse was quite severe. Briere and Smiljanich (1993) found that 80% of sexually abused men who reported sexually aggressive behaviour towards women had themselves been sexually abused by women during childhood. Summit (1983) also sees the perpetuation of child molestation and rape as part of the sexually abused boy's legacy of rage.""

[Protecting boys from the risk of sexual abuse](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0300443951100102)

Because few male victims admit their victimisation to academic researchers, it has been assumed that either boys are less vulnerable to sexual abuse than girls or that their abuse is less damaging. As a result, very little attention has been given to the protection of boys. This negligence is surprising given the known relationship between male sexual victimisation and the later commission of sexual offences (Kohn, 1987; Dimock, 1988; Briggs, Hawkins and Williams, 1994). In his current British study, Bentovim (1994) has found that one in five male victims becomes a juvenile offender.

**Discrimination against male victims of sexual assault.**

[Perceptions of sexual coercion in heterosexual dating relationships: The role of aggressor gender and tactics](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00224490609552302)

""There is a double standard in how sexually coercive behaviors are viewed when perpetrated by a man and woman. He is aggressive; she is promiscuous. Likewise, there is a double standard in how the victims are viewed. In the conditions where the woman was the victim, she was perceived as primarily victimized; however, when the man was the victim, he was primarily viewed as romantically interested. These findings support previous research (e.g., Hannon et al., 2000; Harris, 1991; Harris &amp; Knight-Bohnhoff, 1996) which argued that there is trivialization of women's coercion against men.""

[Bahrain Penal Code](http://www.unodc.org/res/cld/document/bhr/1976/bahrain_penal_code_html/Bahrain_Penal_Code_1976.pdf)

The penal code of Bahrain discriminates based on the sex of the victim when it comes to sexual assault. Chapter 2 ""Rape and Sexual Assault"" covers this.

According to Article 344, sexually assaulting a woman will result in the following penalties:

""Life imprisonment shall be the penalty for any person who assaults a woman without her consent.""

""The penalty shall be a death sentence or life imprisonment if the victim is less than sixteen years of age.""

""The non-consent of the victim shall be presumed if she is less than fourteen years of age.""

So what are the penalties for sexually assaulting a man? Article 346 lays this out:

""A prison sentence for a period not exceeding ten years shall be the punishment for any person who assaults another against his will.""

""The punishment shall be a prison sentence if the victim is less than sixteen years.""

""The non-consent of the victim shall be presumed if he is less than fourteen years.""

So if a woman or girl is raped, the perpetrator will receive a death penalty or life sentence. If a man or boy is raped, the perpetrator will receive a prison sentence for a period not exceeding ten years.",1.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iavcnv/some_sources_on_sexual_abuse_of_men_and_boys_part/,problem_redditor

2020-08-17 03:39:56,Are Feminists necessarily racists?,"If you know something about Feminism you must know that white men are their enemy number one. ""White"" because according to their bewildering worldview everybody else is oppressed and discriminated against but white men. And  no white men can be oppressed and discriminated against, not even those who clearly are oppressed and discriminated against.

But that's not the whole story. All you need is a little shift in their perspective and it's men of all color who are even worse. I realized this while listening to an interview with a Plan International employee. Did you know that those third-world countries are awful places for women and girls because, you guessed it, the men over there are disgusting thugs. So, it seems that when they change to that gear it's the ""white men's patriarchies"" that are way better than the patriarchies of the brown men or whoever they happen to be talking about. They don't say this out loud but that's the only conclusion you can come to. 

I know that Feminists are sexists more than anything else. But it seems that they have become racists, too. That's because they apparently feel that ""men"" are too vague a term, and they have this urge to define more accurately which group of men they are just now hating and waging war against.

2020-08-17 04:36:56,We need to put an end to the 20% rule,"*I attempted to post this in unpopular opinions, but it was flagged as being about feminism and removed.*


Since many here are millennials and younger, I am probably going to have to define the 20% rule.  For GenX and older it was the unwritten rule that men should never use more than 20% of their strength with women.  It was taught explicitly in previous generations and is still taught today. The only difference is that the phrase is considered sexist now. 

Today young boys are discouraged from using more that 20% with women, but it‚Äôs no longer taught as one of the golden rules. It‚Äôs why if women hit men, men are shamed for hitting back. If a man does hit back, he is expected to limit the amount of force with a woman. This is something men would never be expected to restrain if hit by another man.

When men shake women‚Äôs hands they almost always use only a fraction of the strength they use with other men. When men physically play with women we do so as though we can break them.  Contact sports are the same thing.  It is exceptionally rare for men to respond to women with the same physical strength as with other men.

This needs to end.  Men need to stop treating women as though they are fragile little children.  We should start assuming she can change that tire, and expect her to do so.  If the box is heavy we should assume she can get it done. From hand shakes to football.  If she gets bruised, she can get some sports cream.

Men should always use the same amount of strength with women as we do with men.

Do not interpret what I said as it being ok to intentionally hurt anyone.  I‚Äôm not saying abuse women. I am saying stop treating them like weak defenseless children.",1.0,1.0,1.0,58.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iazwe1/we_need_to_put_an_end_to_the_20_rule/,Suck-Less

Sometimes I feel like I just need to chill, but I know there's legit reasons I should be concerned for him being male. 

Last night I was browsing this sub after his story/bed time, and I started to get very paranoid. What if when he gets older, he gets falsely accused of sexual assault? What if he finds himself in a situation of DV and has nowhere to go? What if he commits suicide? 

Because men are seen as disposable and their mental health isn't taken seriously, I'm worried for little boys and males of all ages.

2020-08-17 12:03:19,Six facts the SPLC can't deny,"A while back I posted something about my lawsuit against the vile Southern Poverty Law Center. It generated quite a lot of interest, so thought I'd post an update. The lawsuit is a defamation claim against the SPLC over an article it published in January, 2018, attacking an effort  by another guy and I to try to open a ""life treatment"" program for men in danger of overdose or suicide.

Our program was called the Robinson Jeffers Boxing Club. It was a 13-week residency program that featured healthy eating, exercise, rigorous academic studies, and two hours daily of intensive boxing training. While the program was open to men in distress of any race, it focused on white males because, overwhelmingly, that's where the crisis is. Moreover, white males face unique challenges.

There are plenty of experts who claim white males are in crisis because of ""loss of privilege"" or ""endangered entitlement"", and you can almost see them gleefully rubbing their hands together in anticipation. But they are wrong, In the first place, this whole thing of white male entitlement is a delusion. Whites males were never privileged in any way beyond what normally accrues to members of a society they, as the dominant group, built. The Han are by far the dominant majority in China, but they would think you were nuts if you scolded them for their Han supremacy or Han privilege.

I saw a commercial the other  night that provides a much better explanation for the crisis among white men. The commercial featured a buff black guy standing with his shirt off. A  Jewish-looking wizard character was selling him some grooming product. At the end of his spiel, he says, ""Don't be like that guy"" and he points over to a flabby, buffoonish white guy with his belly hanging out flailing his arms and stumbling around as he tries not to fall down.  When a 12-year-old white boy sees that, you better believe it has an impact. When a 12-year-old white *girl* sees that, you better believe it has an impact. If you are a 20 year old white guy, the only messages you've ever received from your culture about being a white man have been messages like that. 

To me, it seems perfectly obvious why white men, only 30 percent of the population, but 70 percent of the nation's suicides, are in crisis\&amp;mdash;racial denigration. Starting from there, I developed [the RJBC program](https://craignelsen.com/rjbc/index.php).  

My theory may be wrong, of course, but given more than one hundred people kill themselves in the United States every day, it seems worth it to at least give my approach a shot. But that was too much for the SPLC, which published an article comparing the program to ""Nazi atrocities"" and leaving readers  in Lexington, Missouri\&amp;mdash;the club's location\&amp;mdash;with the false belief we were opening a ""whites-only"" club right downtown at 1419 Main Street. We were quickly shut down.

Financially ruined, I filed a defamation claim against the SPLC in the US District Court in Kansas City in November, 2018.  On July 31, 2019, I survived the SPLC's Motion to Dismiss--the first, apparently, of the scores of plaintiffs who have claimed defamation against the SPLC over the years. Not bad, considering I have no funding, I am representing myself,  and I'm not an attorney.

Now we are in Discovery, and I'm really trying to bring attention to this suit for fundraising and for informal legal discussion.

2020-08-17 15:30:07,On the Black Lives Matter organization,"Blm is a Marxist organization whose primary purpose is not to help black lives, but to bring about a communism society in America. One of the cofounders said that she and another cofounder were ‚Äútrained Marxists.‚Äù https://imgur.com/gallery/0vQNK0K Demonstrating just how far left they are, another cofounder wrote an article on a Venezuelan news website in which she called out Bernie Sanders for calling Hugo Chavez a dictator. https://imgur.com/gallery/vK367Kv
Even worse, Susan Rosenburg sits on the Board of Directors of blm. Susan has taken part in communist organizations in America and was arrested in 1984 and sentenced to 58 years in prison on weapons and explosives charges. She was also sought as an accomplice to a couple of bombings. She is free now because her sentence was commuted by Bill clinton. http://archive.is/0F5T0 The Black Lives Matter website itself says that one of its goals is to disrupt the nuclear family, one of the stated goals found within the Communist Manifesto. https://imgur.com/gallery/h2pW1J9 This alone shows just how little the group cares for black lives. One of the most devastating things to have hit black America in the latter half of the 20th century has been the destruction of the nuclear family. 

Single motherhood makes children much more likely to live in poverty and commit crimes. Not attacking single mothers, but the trend is real. Over 70% of African-Americans are born to single mothers. This is the major problem facing the community. Black fathers have to begin caring for the women they impregnate and the children they bear, who once abandoned by their fathers, are forced into a life of poverty. A nuclear family with a father in the home makes a boatload of difference. Prior to the mid-1960s, nearly all children were born to married couples, including black children. This phenomenon was reversed once the progressive War on Poverty began. The welfare state incentivized single motherhood as it provided mothers with welfare benefits if there was no man in the house. https://www.heritage.org/welfare/report/how-welfare-undermines-marriage-and-what-do-about-it Additionally, the vast majority of African-Americans that are murdered in America are killed by other blacks. This is not to say that we should ignore police brutality, as that should be addressed as well. Police who commit murder against unarmed civilians should be punished and police reform should be enacted. However, the group is spreading the false narrative that police and racism are the most dangerous things facing black America. This is false. As mentioned previously, the vast majority of African-Americans who are killed are killed by other blacks, not whites. We have seen this trend worsen with blm‚Äôs calls to defund the police. Democrat-run cities that have surrendered to these proposals have seen skyrocketing crime rates, including black-on-black crime. https://imgur.com/gallery/nrpWWAu https://imgur.com/gallery/r7Wioos There was an 8-year old girl in Atlanta who was shot by an armed blm protestor. https://imgur.com/gallery/8hJhwJV . This is but one of many instances of the black-on-black violence that has plagued America. Despite this, blm has not changed its stance on policing. Thus, Davis Dorn, an African-American who was protecting his friend‚Äôs pawn shop, was killed by looters. Patrick Underwood, a black police officer, was killed in Oakland. https://abc7news.com/officers-shot-oakland-shooting-federal-building/6221576/ http://archive.is/hXiqZ https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2016/crime-in-the-u.s.-2016/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-3.xls https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-09-29/race-and-homicide-in-america-by-the-numbers https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2018/crime-in-the-u.s.-2018/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-6.xls https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2020/6/8/21281998/chicago-deadliest-day-violence-murder-history-police-crime Compare that to the number of unarmed blacks killed by cops. Most blacks that are killed by the police are actually armed. https://imgur.com/gallery/gdN68hk http://archive.vn/JDNxE#selection-2511.0-2528.0 https://imgur.com/gallery/wAZyQrF More evidence that blm‚Äôs main goal is not helping blacks, but overthrowing the US for a communist society is the fact that they have continuously defaced statues important to American history. They have even defaced statues of abolitionists and Union soldiers. One of the main goals found in the Communist Manifesto is the destruction of the nuclear family, religion, and national identity in order to make way for a communist society. This seems to be what blm is attempting. Why else would they deface the statue of anti-slavery poet Greenleef Whittier? https://imgur.com/gallery/LHUpOLa They also toppled the statue of a Norwegian immigrant and abolitionist who served in the Union Army during the American Civil War. http://archive.is/ELeRu. They defaced a statue of Abraham Lincoln in London https://imgur.com/gallery/irSbE8j and The Colorado State Capitol Khachkar memorial to the Armenian Genocide http://archive.is/h5yOz. As we see, they are deliberately trying to destroy the memory of Western Civilization, just as the Communist Manifesto calls for. These aren‚Äôt isolated events. Rioters in Philly deface a statue of Matthias Baldwin, an early abolitionist who fought against slavery. https://imgur.com/gallery/dqq0zod. They vandalized the Memorial to the Victims of Communism in DC https://imgur.com/gallery/R5JQ8JL as well as the DC statue of Tadeusz Ko≈õciuszko, who fought for the rights of minorities. In his will, he donated a portion of his estate to free slaves belonging to Thomas Jefferson. He also bequeathed sums for the education of freed slaves. https://imgur.com/gallery/ynAeuXY . They also defaced the Memorial to Vietnam Veterans, many of whom were African-Americans.

Furthermore, the majority of interracial crimes in America are not committed by whites, but by blacks. The groups is spreading the narrative the African-Americans are overly policed. However, black men, who make up around 6.5% of the population, commit over 50% of the violent crimes. I recommend you watch videos by Thomas Sowell, Larry Elder, and Brandon Tatum. I also recommend you search up Terry Crews‚Äô videos and tweets. They are all African-Americans who give an alternative perspective to that given by blm activists. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFqVNPwsLNo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhy-NvXt0-U https://imgur.com/gallery/eXK6KeG https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv5-mc4U_Zw&amp;t=2s",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ib9ms7/on_the_black_lives_matter_organization/,deadmanwalking0

2020-08-17 21:45:43,I know I‚Äôm not the only one. My story:,"I met a girl on Tinder 2+ years ago.  Almost immediately, she began sending me naked pictures.  That same night, we met up and had sex.  Before penetration, I pulled out a condom, and she said to put it away.  She told me that she had a heart disease that made it ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù to get pregnant.  As I was about to finish, I asked her where she wants me to finish, and she told me to finish inside of her.  I hesitated, and she said (yes, during sex) that 3 separate doctors told her it was ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù for her to get pregnant.  She also said that it was a huge turn on to have a man finish inside of her.

Turns out, she lied.  Not only was it not ‚Äúimpossible,‚Äù but she had previously retweeted posts about making good money off child support.  Now I have a son who lives 5 hours away.

This is the equivalent to a non-forcible rape.  I consented to the sex.  I did not consent to using my semen for reproductive purposes.  Nonetheless, I have no legal right to do anything.  I‚Äôm a lawyer, and I even contacted colleagues to figure out what I could do.  Nothing.

What if I did this to a woman?  What if I removed a condom just before I finished and impregnated a woman?  Would I be criminally charged?  Would I lose my law license?  Would my face be plastered all over the news?

Instead, I am left alone paying child support, with no ability to contest anything.  I am labeled as a deadbeat dad.  I am not allowed to be a victim.

I did everything right.

I treated her with respect and chivalry.

I'm not saying that we don't point out all the crap that is being done to us and boys.  I'm not saying that we don't call out all the discrimination that is happening to us simply because we are men.. I'm saying that we need to point it out, recognize it and then try to do something about it.  

I think that's the difference here.  Men don't just complain about something, and then look for a handout like women/ SJWs do... they look for a solution.  Men look to fix the problem, not get someone else to fix it for them by giving them special rights.

2020-08-18 09:12:15,My Experience Going to Therapy,"I have been to therapy for a year and couple of months, for the first time, It was traumatising. I couldn't sleep properly for many nights. I was gaslighted, dismissed my problems. I felt like I had to strip naked with no solutions to my problems. The female therapist was passive-aggressive, lacked boundaries and she doesn't value privacy. After many sessions I figured out that she is a feminist.  I noticed that she lacks accountability for her actions and she is the type that wouldn't admit mistakes.

What I have felt from her that she lacks empathy or pretends that she has empathy. I told her that the therapy is a failure and I wanted to leave the therapy she kept on manipulating me to stay to seek more attention to validate her own feelings. I told her that most women are liars and men tend to be more on the truth. She told me it is what it is rather than saying we all must say the truth. She accepted the fact that women are liars. Whenever I tell her the truth she feels offended and see it as a lie. She doesn't accept any criticism. 

I think even if men did go to therapy they will be disregarded because how their ideas are based on Marxism and other theories that are fundamentally anti-oppressive practice. One of them is that men are the oppressors.

In my head, I have been thinking very deeply about my family problem factors, the therapy and social factors. I have accepted my fate how I am living my life. That I will have to be alone doing things that I want to do that doesn't involve anyone just myself. I learned that I need to be by myself and think for myself and stop caring about other people. I learned that I have to isolate myself more, read books to increase my knowledge and explore other things by myself. 

Since I have an autoimmune disease named psoriasis, it was bad then became worse when did therapy. Now when I have stopped it, I feel relieved and a free human being.

I think men shouldn't share their vulnerabilities to women because they will dismiss it. I think sharing vulnerability to certain men who understand it and knows how to deal with it and who have been in that situation.",1.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ibr9b5/my_experience_going_to_therapy/,Xpredata

2020-08-18 20:18:05,Is everything going downhill for boys and young men in this brave new feminist world?,"I had a conversation with an acquaintance who's into politics. Told her that in my opinion many important things have been going downhill in education, work, families, intimate relationships, substance abuse, overall marginalization, even isolation, and what have you. I just can't see the future optimistically when I think about the young.  How are particularly boys supposed to see hope in the future, how can  they even wish to become respected members of their societies?

She told that I'm not necessarily right because there are certain good things happening, too, explaining about certain initiatives the government is implementing. 

I said that I have little reason to believe that they really are doing something to help particularly boys who are falling behind much faster than girls. The track record of all politicians is so poor.

After that we exchanged a few words but there was no meaningful discussion.  It's like we'd live in different universes. 

Anyway, all that got me thinking how right I really am. Are there any positive trends going on with boys and young men? Or is everything really going downhill?

By ""downhill"" I mean a comparison between the world perhaps 20-30 years ago. Back then there were problems but, at least, there was hope. Many more young men than today could hope that if they studied they'll find a decent job, get married, and have a family. Work hard, perhaps, but get respect from their families, societies, even their governments. Now all that have become much harder and respect perhaps more like  a distant mirage than a realistic goal.",1.0,1.0,1.0,17.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ibzwxp/is_everything_going_downhill_for_boys_and_young/,accidental_me

2020-08-18 20:39:02,False accusations and denied contact with my son (UK),"Hello all,

I wanted (and needed) to share my story which happened about a year ago in the UK. It's quite a long story and painful story but I'll try not to omit any important detail. The point of me sharing it is for people in a similar situation to understand that it happens to anyone, that it is not their fault, and maybe also in order to get some advice from you lot.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll start with a quick background about myself : I am a 33yo French citizen, who moved in the UK in 2013 (I was 26 then). In september 2014, I started working as a language teacher in a school where I met a music teacher. She is a Romanian native (the nationality doesn't really matter, it's only to explain the legal implication) who was granted English citizenship 15 years ago. I fell in love.

A bit of background about the woman, lets call her ""B"" : 11 years older than I am, i was freshly arrived in the UK when I met her (just about a year in the country). Abandoned by her father at the age of three, she lived in Romania before moving to the UK. She has been living in the country since 1998 when she arrived, where she studied and got a degree in music. She married twice, once in 1999, divorced after 6 months, the second time in 2007, divorced in 2009. She has a son from the second marriage who was born in 2008. I know very little about the father, as he is virtually completely absent of his son's life. He lives abroad (South America), and sends birthday cards that his mother puts directly in the bin as soon as they arrived. The son has never had contact with his father for the last 10 years. I was told by B that he was a violent man which is why she filed for divorce. I had only her word for it, but of course, there was no reason for me to question it.

&amp;#x200B;

We started our relationship in December 2014, started living together in March 2015, and had a child (wonderful little boy) in February 2016.  The relationship had its ups and downs of course, but nothing specific really. We have two different temperaments : she is extremely controlling and ""motherly driven"" where I am quite old school in terms of parenting. I, for example, think it's a good idea to teach young boys to use a pocket knife, sleep in a tent, make a fire and so on. She is extremely protective, which I believed was a result of being abandonned and her history of ""conjugal violence"". 

My relationship with her previous child was extremely complicated : both of them are extremely fusional, and the child used to sleep in his mother's bed when I moved in (he was 7 or 8 at that time). I found it odd, and we agreed that he was a bit too old for that and that he had to learn to be a bit more independant. As the father was absent, I immediately took him under my wings, and although we are extremely different (he is a very passive and dreamy child, where I'm a bit burly), I tried to share my interests with him as much as finding out about his interests. We had a plan for me to offically adopt the child and I did everything I could in order for it to happen, but there was always a setback on her part and I finally gave up. The child was calling me ""daddy"" and I was, it seems, a real surrogate father. However, they would whisper to one another while I was in the room, speak in romanian very quickly (which I didnt really mind, I was learning Romanian myself but it was too fast for me to understand everything), or spend a lot of time just the two of them. More than once, I felt excluded from their relationship, which again, I figured was normal as they had a ""special"" bond. Still hurt though.

In Feb 2016 my son was born. He was born with a cleft palate and a tumour in the throat and I had to spend several weeks in hospital (where the staff did an amazing job). He is absolutely fine now and everything is under control. I loved the little lad at first sight and I was the proudest father. Born in the Uk from a UK citizen, he has English nationality. As a French citizen, he is untitled to a double citizenship, and I asked his mother to do the paperwork. Again, as for the adoption part, a lot of setbacks on her side : she had to produce a ""birth certificate"" from her, which she alleged was very difficult to obtain.

However I also realised I was extremely unhappy : I missed France a lot, I hated my job as a teacher, and B had continual expectations : I was not allowed to go out of the house without having my phone, everytime I would go out with friends, she would disagree, I try to do sports (rugby and karate) but she believed it was taking too much of my time and I was in freemasonry but it was contrary of her christian beliefs so I had to quit as well.

Now, as a French guy, I love wine. As a depressed guy, it happened that I had one drink too many. The maximum I would drink in a week would be two bottles of wine, or half of bottle of whisky. I always drank on my own, in the evenings, never when the children were around. In the lapse of our relationship I have been ""drunk"" (incoherent speaking and impeded mobility) twice (which I believe is not too bad over 4 years) and I did not see that as a problem. I never missed a day of work, was never violent, and I thought I was just ""enjoying"" my free time. But it seems she saw it as a major weakness.

She asked me to take antidepressants and to follow therapy, which I did, with very little success. In 2018, we bought a house together. I personally refurbished the house completely and dealt with the furnitures. She had little interest in that and wasn't really invested. 

Fast forward May 2019 : I had just found a brand new job which was of much more intest to me. I started to be more assertive and was putting up very little with her controlling behaviour anymore. She said that she wanted to separate, to which I replied that she was free to leave the house at anytime. She did not want to find herself in a precarious situation, so she stayed, but she said she felt ""trapped"". Situation started to get tense.

At the end of May, she took the kids and went to live with her parents (oh yes, I forgot, her parents were living 5 minutes from our place). On Monday, she was out. On Wednesday morning, the police arrived in my living room, cuffed me and said I was arrested on investigation of ""multiple counts of rape"" on B and ""molestion"" on the kids. None of it was true, of course.

I was taken into custody and interrogated for 13 hours. I was release at 3 in the morning with only my wallet and my car keys (they had confiscated my phone and my house keys). I was told I could not go back to my house for the duration of the investigation. I had no place to go, so there was only one thing I could do : take my back and go back to France.

Now : I lost my job a week later as I explained that unfortunately I could not come back for the moment. I had strictly no money and I was entirely subjected to the decision of the Crown prosecution service. 2 months later, they dropped the investigation, as there were (righfully so) strictly no evidence to back up her claims. However, B managed to take a ""non-molestation order"" at the court, which can be taken unilaterally. I should have been notified of this order, but she pretexted I had disappeared and she did not know my address or contact details, which was of course completely false. When I said that I was going to challenge the order (after she finally sent me the papers), she replied, and I quote, ""do not do that, you don't know what I am capable of, and mothers always win"". The order stated that I could not contact my son or go anywhere near him for a year. I asked on what evidence this order was taken. I received no answer.

So I was left with the wounds and the pain of the situation. I had to get out of the pit very quickly or I don't know what I would have done. In September 2019, I applied to finish my law degree (in France) which I had put on hold, finished it with honours, and am now training to be a solicitor. 

I haven't had contact with my son for over a year now, so I have requested that I could call him on the phone to check on him. 

I received an answer from B saying (the following is a direct copy paste from her response, Y being her previous son, X being mine)

 

*Hello*

*I appreciate your desire to have contact with our son, X . I would like X to be able to have a relationship with his father.*¬†

*I am very concerned about X‚Äôs safety and well-being.*

*I say this because between 2015-2019 myself, Y and X have been the victims of numerous abuses inflicted upon us by you.*

*I will only list a few:*

*Verbal abuse towards all three of us*¬†

*Financial abuse towards all three of us*¬†

*Sexual abuse towards myself*¬†

*You suffocated X , you fell completely drunk over him when he was 3-4 weeks old*¬†

*Repeated binge drinking by you*

*regular and excessive drunkenness on your part*

*Drunk driving, including with X in the car*

*Unsafe use of sharp blades ( sword, pocket knife, Swiss knife) with Francois and Filip*

*Physical violence towards Y*

*Daily verbal abuse towards myself, X, Y*

*Belittling and bullying*¬†

*Psychological abuse towards myself, Y and X*

*Daily manipulative and deceitful behaviour towards all three of us*

&amp;#x200B;

All of those claims are complete lies. Some of them have a basis of truth, of course, which makes it a good lie, but nothing of what she states is true. Moreover, she made claims a year before, which were investigated and found unfounded. There is not a single shred of evidence for she states and it baffles me that she still manages to pull those things. Justice being what it is, she has to provide evidence for those claims and there are none. I never fell drunk with my kid, certainly didn't suffocate or abuse, him, certainly didn't rape his mother, and so on. But it's enough for her to cry and shake and say those horrible things for me to be perceived as a monster.

Now, unfortunately for her, I am in a much better place. I have legal training myself and will get in contact with social services. I replied that if she carried on perpetuating those false claims I would fill slander and libel. 

Well, here we are, roughly. It's a long story but you get the idea. I just think it's amazing how a person can be and act in a completely irrational way in order to gain some satisfaction.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ic07t6/false_accusations_and_denied_contact_with_my_son/,tinour7

2020-08-18 23:08:59,The untested rape kit backlog has an entirely mundane explanation and is not caused by a rape culture,"I've seen a lot of people talking about a rape kit backlog to justify this idea that we don't care about women or sexual assault.

And while it is true that sometimes the police have biases and don't always handle rape cases properly, this is the exception, not the rule.

The existence of this backlog has a much more mundane explanation. It also mirrors a backlog for other forms of DNA evidence that has also gone untested over the years.

####Most rape kits go untested for completely mundane, non-malicious reasons

* The defendant claims to have had consensual sex with the plaintiff.  At this point matching his DNA is a moot point because he's already admitted to having sex with the plaintiff. So the question turns into, was it consensual?

* The defendant admits to the crime or takes a plea deal.  Again matching his DNA becomes moot because the police have already secured a verdict.

* The case against the defendant is strong enough that they do not need DNA evidence. Testing a rape kit takes time and money that many police districts do not have.  Especially when the case against the defendant is strong enough without that evidence.  Sometimes this can backfire but it is a relatively normal occurrence in law enforcement. Including for other crimes besides rape.

* Related to the above, [rape kits commonly exclude the primary suspect](https://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles/dnaevid.txt) and are therefore left untested for ""strategic"" reasons (which likely results in convictions against people who are otherwise innocent).

* The plaintiff recants before the rape kit is tested.

* The police are assholes and don't treat the plaintiff fairly (or they're simply negligent).  This has been linked to socioeconomic status and race.  And it can happen to anyone for any type of crime; this is not unique to women or to sexual assault cases.

* There is no defendant to test the evidence against.  This is the biggest reason for older kits going untested.  Up until very recently, the technology to store DNA in a computer database didn't exist.  You had to have a defendent to test the evidence against.  And this process often destroyed the evidence making it useless if you tested it against the wrong person.

* Related to the above, if the police weren't sure enough about a suspect, they may have chosen to not test the rape kit because doing so would destroy the evidence and make it useless in a criminal trial.

You can see some of these reasons outlined here:

*""The Rape Kit Backlog and What‚Äôs Being Done about It"". https://nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu/rape-kit-backlog-whats-done/*

This has led to a controversy (discussed in the above link) around which rape kits deserve to be ""counted"" in these backlog numbers.  The only kits that should be counted come from the last two reason outlined above. But many of these activists groups add totals from the other categories to artificially inflate the numbers that they cite.  They also tend to imply that the only reason for this backlog is a police bias against female sexual assault victims.  Making their argument circular in nature and completely divorced from reality.

#### DNA databases only became useful relatively recently

One thing that might surprise a lot of people is the fact that we didn't have useful DNA databases until very recently.

[This article from 2018](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-serial-killers-20180429-story.html) described such technology, as depicted in TV crime dramas, as a work of ""science fiction"".

The earliest databases do go back to around 1998 (per Wikipedia) but it was only after the early 2010s that they became useful enough, and cheap enough to use, that regularly storing DNA evidence started making sense.

The reason for this was not due to a lack of trying, but due to a lack of efficient technology to accommodate this (as evidenced by the fact that we ""tried"" to do this as far back as the 1990s).

The early 2010s is also the same time that the police started digging around and realized that they had a rape kit backlog.

The police themselves are the ones who first came forward and starting asking for grant money to test those kits in order to help solve cold cases and identify serial rapists (see the [first link above](https://nccriminallaw.sog.unc.edu/rape-kit-backlog-whats-done/) for details about some of these proposals in the state of North Carolina).

This idea that outside groups discovered mass corruption and coverups inside the police is a wild fantasy with no merit in the real world.

####DNA testing backlogs exist for other crimes as well

DNA backlogs don't just exist for rape kits.  As the police go through old evidence from cold cases, they're discovering similar backlogs pretty much everywhere.

Samuel Little, a 79 year old serial killer, was recently convicted of up to 93 murders that came to light as a result of testing these backlogs in unsolved murder cases.

The police involved in this case have come out asking other police districts in the area to test DNA from some of their cold cases in an effort to help solve murders that may be attributed to him.

*""FBI confirms Samuel Little's confession: He is the worst serial killer in U.S. history"". https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/fbi-confirms-samuel-little-s-confession-he-worst-serial-killer-n1063381*

*""From Golden State Killer to Grim Sleeper, DNA helping break serial killer mysteries from 1970s and 1980s"". https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-serial-killers-20180429-story.html*

*""Illinois State Police On Huge DNA Backlog: ‚ÄòWe Have A Lot To Do‚Äô"". https://will.illinois.edu/news/story/illinois-state-police-on-huge-dna-backlog-we-have-a-lot-to-do*

The fact that we have prioritized DNA testing for rape kits, and not for DNA backlogs in other areas, really proves the opposite point here: *we care more about women and sexual assault than we do victims of other crimes*.

All of the noise around untested rape kits should be interpreted as another example of philogyny and gynocentrism.  This ""problem"" exists pretty much everywhere in law enforcement, but as a society we've made sure to make noise and tackle areas where women are disproportionately affected first.

####Rape cases are given just as much attention as other crimes, have a slightly higher conviction rate, and female jurors are less likely to convict a defendant than male jurors

Just to put one last nail in the coffin here I want to make a point about this.  Rape culture (at least against *female* victims) is largely a myth.  As a society we care deeply about women being victimized in any way, especially when it comes to sexual assault. Even women's groups like RAINN have come out and said that the existence of a ""rape culture"" is overblown and that we actually do a pretty good job helping women and convicting rapists.

In fact by giving the notion of a rape culture too much credit, we are discouraging actual rape victims from coming forward and going to the police.  They end up being discouraged not because of an actual rape culture, but because they'll hear this myth that they'll be made fun of and subjected to invasive testing for a rape kit that will go unused.

Which is simply not true and is a harmful belief to spread.  A fact that has even been acknowledged by women's groups who are trying to address this problem.

Not to mention that such a narrative is offensive towards men who are unfairly painted as villains here.

If anyone is slow to believe a rape victim or to convinct a rapist, it's actually women, not men.  Most men care deeply about women and will do anything in their power to seek justice and prevent these kinds of crimes from happening. Often to the point of organizing mobs and beating up or murdering accused rapists on nothing more than an allegation.  Some of whom later come out as having been completely innocent the whole time.

The fact is, most men are not rapists and most men do not encourage or condone rape.  These arguments make about as much sense as saying that there's a ""murder culture among men"" because murders often go unsolved and because there's untested DNA evidence from murder crime scenes.

The world isn't perfect and we can always work to improve it.  But blindly exaggerating things and making baseless allegations against men for these problems doesn't help anyone.  It's time we started looking at things like this factually and rationally instead of jumping to conclusions and assuming that everything is some kind of conspiracy meant to victimize women.

2020-08-19 13:04:27,Drag Race Canada - discrimination continued,"I spotted a bit of everyday misandry in a recent ep of Drag Race Canada and uploaded the relevant few minutes of the ep to YouTube.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE236iOYV5Y

In brief - two contestants each detail a sex related assault. One with a female perpetrator. One male.

They have no compunctions about calling the one with the male perpetrator sexual assault, through strictly speaking, i.e. in terms of meeting the criminal definition it probably isn't. It was a revenge bashing for not putting out.

The one perpetrated by a female would meet the criminal definition. While working at a club as a performer, the contestant had some random woman stick her finger up his butt. Since it was a workplace that could also qualify as sexual harassment, depending on the country. Not all countries protect staff against harassment by customers.

Did the show present it as either?

Nope. Of course not. The presenter gave us a horrified gasp and the contestants did their little comical bit begging female attendees at their gigs to behave.

i.e. the show normalised both female-on-male sexual assault and sexual harassment.

The show's producers buried that under a bogus copyright infringement claim. Funnily enough there's a tonne of other videos in YouTube for Drag Race Canada which don't highlight embarrassing discrimination and they haven't been blocked. In a couple of weeks I can appeal that to YT but in the meantime it's gone.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ichg8i/drag_race_canada_discrimination_continued/,ThirdTurnip

This scene was in a family film and it made me think that when the boy in the shot grows up he might not be happy that he was treated that way. I don't think that girls are treated this way in movies.

2020-08-20 03:46:35,False accusation of sexual abuse and molestation : how to respond (UK),"Hi guys,

I have posted a few days about my own experience, where my former made claims of repeated rape on her and molestation on my child in order to to get everything (the house, my money, my son). Those claims were investigated by the police and the social services and they found, of course, nothing. However, she keeps repeating them to me. I am a trainee solicitor and I wanted to share my answers to those claims, in case it might help someone in a similar situation.

**The claims** (taken directly from an email received two days ago) :

¬∑ Verbal abuse towards all three of us

¬∑ Financial abuse towards all three of us 

¬∑ Sexual abuse towards myself 

¬∑ You suffocated X (my child) , you fell completely drunk over him when he was 3-4 weeks old

¬∑ Repeated binge drinking by you 

¬∑ regular and excessive drunkenness on your part

¬∑ Drunk driving, including with X in the car 

¬∑ Unsafe use of sharp blades ( sword, pocket knife, Swiss knife) with X and Y (her son from a previous marriage)

¬∑ Physical violence towards Y 

¬∑ Daily verbal abuse towards myself, X and Y

¬∑ Belittling and bullying 

¬∑ Psychological abuse towards myself, X and Y 

¬∑ Daily manipulative and deceitful behaviour towards all three of us.

&amp;#x200B;

My response after consultation of some friends working in family and criminal law :

&amp;#x200B;

1. ¬∑ Verbal abuse towards all three of us : **no evidence, hearsay, no legal ground.**
2. ¬∑ Sexual abuse towards myself : **defamation, strictly no evidence, no medical records, no doctor‚Äôs appointment suggesting it is the case, text messages asking for sexual relationship from the ex-partner not a week before the claims, self admission that sexual life was occuring frequently. Family was living nearby, ex-partner was older and had allegedly suffered violence from previous partner, so was knowledgeable of the actions required, which were not taken. No psychological record, ex-partner continues to work on her job as if nothing happens, extremely unlikely for an actual victim of abuse. On the other hand, defendant had to ask for psychological help after claims, showing distress.**
3. ¬∑ You suffocated X , you fell completely drunk over him when he was 3-4 weeks old : **no legal ground, no medical record. If true, questions the ability of the mother to take care of the child. Why wasn‚Äôt the child taken for examination after said incident if true ? Vague time frame (3 months ? 4 months ?).**
4. ¬∑ Repeated binge drinking by you : **hearsay, certainly not a criminal matter, no legal application. Defendant has no recorder history of intoxication.**
5. ¬∑ regular and excessive drunkenness on your part :  **Ibid, same claim as n¬∞4, hearsay, not a criminal matter, no legal application. ""Excessive"" drunkenness has no legal definition.** 
6. ¬∑ Drunk driving, including with X in the car : **hearsay, no evidence, the defendant has never been arrested with or without child, even more whilst being under influence. No occurrence of public intoxication.** 
7. ¬∑ Unsafe use of sharp blades ( sword, pocket knife, Swiss knife) with X and Y: **not a criminal (or civil) matter, no legal ground, very difficult to determine what constitutes ¬´ unsafe use ¬ª. Pocket knife and Swiss knife are synonymous.** 
8. ¬∑ Physical violence towards Y : **hearsey, no medical record. Refers to a particular incident involving said child where disciplined (s58 CA 2004). No injuries. No other incident. Only claim using a specific incident which has been admitted by defendant. No legal implication.**
9. ¬∑ Daily verbal abuse towards myself, X, Y : **Same claim as n¬∞1. Hearsay. No psychological evidence from that period submitted.** 
10. ¬∑ Belittling and bullying : **vain words, no legal ground. No legal definition of ""belittling"", no evidence of bullying.**
11. ¬∑ Psychological abuse towards myself, X and Y : **hearsay, no psychological evidence from that period submitted.**
12. ¬∑ Daily manipulative and deceitful behaviour towards all three of us : **vain words, no legal ground.**

&amp;#x200B;

When the police said those claims to me, I lost control completely and tried to justify myself. I denied everything of course, but I was trying to explain why she was saying that and how it would misunterpreted. Wrong.

Let me make it clear : claims need evidence. It is the woman's duty to provide those evidence. If not evidence, don't do like me and try to think rationally : just laugh at them. Yes it hurts. Yes you would never expect that. But claiming and repeating things don't make them true legally. 

If you need any legal advice, I am more than happy to help. Not only because I am specialising in family law, but also because I went through the process when I was younger and weaker.

2020-08-20 07:11:48,Virtue signalling is not virtuous.,"I am often in debate and surrounded by people who have the best intentions, most people are nice and mean well. But are sorely misguided.

Imagine going to a protest and not knowing what you are protesting about? That kind of stuff.

I used to think it was endearing and comforting, that people would go out,  protest and raise money thinking they were promoting equality, seems harmless enough.

My mind has changed , just because your intentions are in the right place, doesn't mean what you are doing is right.

A specific example I am thinking of right now.

The oversaturation of mental health from the women's perspective. Manipulative statistics in plenty of articles assuming mental issues affect women more than men. Despite the massive disparity in suicide rates.
I believe this type of raising awareness for women, is actually making it worse for many men.

2020-08-21 04:51:00,Discrimination by a policewoman when I reported 2 females breaking the law.,"I live in a European country but it is against the law for women to be topless even on a beach. Nowadays the law is often ignored and no action is ever taken by the police. Many years ago, when the law was sometimes enforced I was on a beach with my young nephew - who at the time was aged 10. 

A couple of foreign women sat down next to us and took off their bikini tops. I started feeling uncomfortable because (1) My nephew kept staring and I did not feel like telling him to stop doing it (2) I did not like that if my gaze happened to venture on the women I would be called a 'pervert'.

On the spur of the moment I called the police hotline where we can report crimes or even misdemeanours. A policewoman answered and I told her what was happening. She asked me for the location and I gave her very clear directions which she understood. She then asked me a strange question: ""are they foreigners?"". I asked her what that had to do with it and she replied sarcastically ""Because foreigners are not used to our hot climate and maybe they are feeling hot."" I asked her what she was going to do about it. She told me that they were going to send a couple of police officers. I spent several more hours there but no police officers appeared and the police had my number had they wanted more information.

Obviously I am not averse to seeing a beautiful naked lady but I just felt like testing the system. As I had suspected women breaking the law (It does not matter whether I agree with the law or not) are treated differently from men. At the time, just a few weeks before this incident, a couple of foreign bots were arrested and taken to court because they had gone skinny dipping on a beach AT NIGHT.",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MensRights/comments/idimeo/discrimination_by_a_policewoman_when_i_reported_2/,zogins

2020-08-21 06:17:53,I am a burly man so I am useless.,"Funny. I may be a guy with education and stuff (like degrees, law, education and music), I may be a guy who likes a good physical encounter, drinking with mates or hunting wildboars.

But I find that there is no place for me in society anymore. I do not agree with people saying that women are a problem or that we, as men, are better off without women. I just don't fucking understand. 

Let me define myself : I am 33 yo guy who is highly educated. I'm not proud of it, I don't fucking care. To be honest, my dream was to be a carpenter, but that didn't sit well in the family. I went to uni and shit. I have three degrees, two masters, and I'm a trainee solicitor. I was a scout in my youth, played rugby, boxing, karate, tennis, horse riding, sailing, and all that shit. I go to the gym, lift weights and run on this fucking treadmill.I can pick a lock, fire a gun and skin a rabbit (or a boar). I can play violin, guitar, trumpet and piano, I write poems (published a fucking book), I can paint, draw or sculpt. I know my plants : I am a fucking good gardener, cook and builder. I am not that good of a mechanic but I am working on it. I can drive a car, a truck, a motorcycle, sail a boat, and pilot a lightweight plane and helicopter. I read Ancient Greek and Latin, speaks 5 fucking different languages. I can smith a knife on a hand build forge. I climb moutains (all mountains in the UK and Mont Blanc in France at 4800km tall). I can milk cows (or whatever the fuck is to be milked), I can sort you out of any situation.

I thought I was doing alright. But no. I am a ""toxic"" person. I should be thinking about my feelings and apoligising for them. I should be tellling people how sorry I am for how offended they are. You know what? Fuck off. 

Sorry guys, I had a bit too much to drink. Needed to vent here.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MensRights/comments/idk7s9/i_am_a_burly_man_so_i_am_useless/,tinour7

I started having my own issues when I was in my early 20s and it took about 15 years to get properly diagnosed and about another 6 to find the magic combination of meds. It can be a tough journey. Mental illness is widely stigmatized and misunderstood. Many people try to hide it or downplay it. 

It‚Äôs historically worse for men to go down this path since the idea of being ‚Äúmanly‚Äù means you aren‚Äôt allowed to show weakness or emotions. This attitude is literally killing people. I myself suffer from bipolar 1 disorder as well as schizophrenia. Bipolar disorder can be misinterpreted as depression or someone having a hot temper. The cycling can cause diagnosing to be very difficult especially if one stays in a mania or depressive state for long periods of time.

I wanted to share a documentary that was done by NBC about male athletes who share their stories with mental health. I‚Äôve watched it myself several times. It first came to my attention when I heard about NHL goaltender Robin Lehner. I just started getting into hockey at the beginning of the 2018 season because my best friend is a fan. While learning about different players that were to be playing for the 2019 season, I learned about Mr. Lehner and I heard his struggle with mental illness. He suffers from bipolar disorder as well so I just felt that connection to him. 

I learned his story, watched clips of games from his past and I watched this man‚Äôs fall apart in a sense and I could see similarities to my own journey. He won the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy for ‚Äúplayer who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to ice hockey‚Äù due to his journey with mental illness. He said that while he ‚Äúwas mentally ill, I‚Äôm not mentally weak.‚Äù That really resonated with me because so many people do think of you struggle with mental illness, you are weak minded and that‚Äôs just not true. It takes a strong person to fight invisible demons.

Anyway, all of my babbling, I just wanted to leave the link to the documentary. I could only find it on YouTube so use and Adblock. I‚Äôd also like to make mention of #SameHere which is used to bring awareness and support for those with mental illness. 

I really hope I‚Äôm not overstepping by talking about this to men while I myself am a woman. I just wanted to let you know that there are people who care and recognize the unique situation men face. Please reach out and get help if you need it.

2020-08-22 04:04:16,Women's right to vote,"I identify as MGTOW.  To me that only means I've opted out of marriage and long-term relationships with women, as is my right.  No one is obligated to marry.  I don't harbor any hostility toward women.  There is certain bad behavior by some women that I object to, and I feel that's my right as well.  If a woman cheats on her husband, I won't call her ""empowered"".  I'll just call her a cheater.  

So that's where I stand.  My MGTOW stance is not political.  My politics are something different.  I was surprised to learn that some MGTOW are in favor of revoking women's right to vote.  I strongly disagree with that.  IMO a representative democracy works best if both men and women cast informed votes.  IMO we've had problems with both men and women casting highly uninformed votes.  We in the US suffer from a misinformation problem, not a problem of a particular gender voting.  

We're at about 100 years now of universal women's suffrage.  It's been even longer in some parts of the country.  (Some states passed suffrage before the Constitution was changed to mandate it.)  I don't see women's suffrage as a bad thing.  I was surprised that some MGTOW see it as bad.  There is disagreement in MGTOW forums over it.  I was wondering how it is here in Men's Rights.

Some 5 years ago a Christian charity was organising a scheme whereby people in my country could host a child from Chernobyl for a few weeks to give them a holiday in the sun. They were live on TV and gave out a telephone number urging people to phone and host a child. On impulse I decided to call since my partner and I were already living together and we'd get a feel of what it was like to look after a child. Apart from this I saw the charitable angle to all this and I was prepared to pay for any expenses. 

A woman answered and I thought that it was strange that she started to make it sound difficult and expensive. ""Can I speak to your wife?"" she asked me. I told her that I was not married (We never got married but we've been living together for several years.)

Upon hearing this the woman at the other end seemed to turn nasty and almost shouted, ""Single men are not allowed into this scheme.""

2020-08-23 04:44:10,Starting a podcast to bring on men to talk about their issues to hopefully spark the conversations in more areas :),"Hey all!

During all of quarantine I started to get really bored so I started thinking what's something I could do that will be useful and be fun for me. After thinking of what I could do for a while, I decided on making a podcast.

For the Boys is a community driven podcast where we talk about men's issues. I've always felt like there aren't many outlets for men to talk about their issues which tend to result in many guys keeping all of their emotions inside and letting it out in inappropriate ways. I hope to tackle these issues that you all have. I want to talk about the issues you deal with during your life and talk about it with you to hopefully come to a solution with you and for everyone else listening. Hopefully with everyone coming on and talking about their day to day issues, more people will see that they aren't alone with their issues and it will provide a safe space to work them through. 

 If this interests you I'd be forever grateful if you take a listen! [Click here](https://linkkle.com/aidan) to listen to either podcast or follow their socials! Any advice or even just a listen means so much to me. Don't forget you're all amazing &lt;3",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ieq2un/starting_a_podcast_to_bring_on_men_to_talk_about/,AAidan7

This rapist boogeyman women are told is hiding around every corner every time they go outside is factually untrue and harmful to both sexes.

In addition to that, men are exactly as likely to be attacked as women. Victimhood of violent crime is identical between the sexes, and men are 3 times (77% overall) more likely to be murdered. Men also get that rush of fear when a stranger approaches them. It's a human response, not a gender specific one. Men just don't complain about how afraid they are all the time because nobody cares and no one is going to coddle them for it.

&amp;#x200B;

I also hate how any time I bring this up the response from people boils down to ""Because some men are bad, women are allowed to view all men as potentially bad"".  Nonononono we don't do that collective guilt shit. If you can take a statement like this and replace the word ""men"" with a race and the resulting sentence sounds extremely racist, it's not okay to say about men either.

2020-08-23 15:10:35,Advice for a young woman trying to not be like her abusive mother?,"Hello all,

To give some backstory to this post:

**I'm a 16 year old girl with parents whom have recently gotten divorced (8 months ago). My mother was incredibly toxic towards both me and my father but I have just recently realized this because she would convince me that my father was the abusive partner in their relationship and that I shouldn't trust him or love him because of all the terrible things he did to her.** After their divorce it was hard for me to spend time with my father because I thought he was a monster but after hearing his side of the story **I realized that HE was the victim of HER abuse.** After the divorce, my dad and I began developing a loving father/daughter relationship that isn't influenced by my mothers lies *(it isn't a perfect relationship, I still have a hard time trusting him but I'm learning to understand that my mom brainwashed me into believing he was a bad man)*

The issue:

Last week my dad and I got into an argument over gas money and out of anger he yelled at me saying that I was ""just like my mother"" and that all women including myself were ""gold digging b\*tches"" *(not exactly this but you get the idea)*

When he said that he thought I was just like my mother I was completely crushed. I haven't spoken to him since out of shame and guilt. I hate that he sees me like her and i desperately want to change. I didn't even notice how similar I was to my mom until he pointed it out and now I'm very paranoid that all men will see me like her.

Since our fight I've been researching how children raised by toxic mothers slowly adopt their mothers' personality and traits. Somewhere in the process I stumbled across this subreddit and I thought the best place to ask advice is from people who also might have experienced the abuse of toxic women

# So in short, I'm asking how can I change:

1. What advice would you give to a young woman who is terrified of being like her toxic mother
2. What toxic traits did you observe in your previous partners early on that turned out to be a big problem later on in the relationship *(I'm asking so I don't make the same mistakes)*
3. Do you think I *(and women in general)* am not able to change my ways? I've seen many posts on subreddits similar to this one saying that all women are terrible/all women do is use men for their own benefit and I desperately don't want to be viewed like that
4. I grew up with parents who never supported each other so I'm wondering in what ways would you have liked to be supported by your previous partner? *(asking so I can know what it's like to be a supportive wife/daughter/friend in the future)*
5. What things have women done/said to you not knowing that it hurt you emotionally *(asking so I don't do this in the future as well)*

2020-08-23 17:57:52,Street harassment of men is an enormous problem and needs a gender-specific solution,"One of the issues that men face in everyday life is getting wolf-whistled and cat-called on the street on a daily basis. All men experience this, frequently, and it is absolutely one of the most degrading things that can happen to a man.

I know a guy who was walking down the street when a young woman walked up and asked if she could grab his junk through his sweatpants. When did women grow so bold and entitled to ask, out of the blue, if they could touch a man like that?

I'll be walking with my headphones in, head down, and suddenly have a woman run up to me and make me take them out. Then she'll ask me what time it is despite the fact that she's wearing a watch. It's disgusting.

I think there needs to be specific legislation to stop this, with specific protections towards men and taxpayer money dedicated to the investigation and prevention for victims, along with the prosecution of victims.

...

So, does this sound kind of ridiculous to you? I think the average reader here is probably wondering why this needs to be gendered for men when women are harassed on the street more often according to most sources. Did any of the feminist lurkers find it even a bit offensive or ridiculous?

Well, now you know how specific action to reduce violence against women looks from our perspective. The overwhelming majority of the victims of violent crime are men.

I wanted menslib to be the bridge between mens rights and feminism. A facts driven community that talks about mens issues in a non hateful and fem inclusive way. A place feminists would respect if I said I got my information from it. But to protect that reputation they have essentially created a policy of not criticizing feminists. The sub has turned into an ask mra sub for feminists.

No hate to feminists but that is our safe space that we created. Not a place to post why men are messier than women because sexism, but to talk about mens reproductive rights or the affects of current legislature on men or anything that is a mens issue. The mens rights movement was created knowing and accepting that feminism is not for us, that we should not expect their help. They should not expect us to host their issues if they do not host ours.

Yes, the young man in my country spends 5-7 years of building and preparing for the house he will marry if he prepares an amount to buy a ready house

Actually a lot is removed from circumcision. The foreskin makes up a big part of the penis, and it does serve a purpose. The foreskin keeps the glans protected and keeps them smooth and moist. Without it, the glans become dry and rough. The foreskin also has a lot of nerve endings. So sexual pleasure is reduced when circumcision happens, and sex becomes more uncomfortable as a result.",1.0,1.0,1.0,54.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ifafkj/i_hate_how_many_people_try_to_trivialize/,AncientBodybuilder

2020-08-24 05:43:34,Senator Kamala Harris grew up without a father. California's family court system is the reason why.,"""This early phase of interaction with my children came to an abrupt halt in 1972 when, after a hard-fought custody battle in the family court of Oakland, California, the context of the relationship was placed within arbitrary limits imposed by a court-ordered divorce settlement based on the false assumption by the State of California that fathers cannot handle parenting . . . Nevertheless, I persisted, never giving up on my love for my children or reneging on my responsibilities as their father,"" he  wrote.

To this day, California family courts continue to discriminate against fathers in custody and child support proceedings.  Senator Harris credits her mother with working hard as a single parent to raise her and her siblings, but neglects to mention that her mother's circumstances were those she herself chose, a preference for single parenthood made reality with the help of a biased family court.

2020-08-24 05:52:04,I shouldn't have to worry about being accused of pedophilia when I take my son to the park.,"Here I sit at the park with my son, the light of my life. There's a splash pad with a little waterside that he has gone down at least 25 times in the last hour. I sit here and watch him have fun, enjoy the water on one of the hottest days of the year, and I'm constantly getting the side eye from all these women who are here, and even some of the men here while I watch my son. 

Why should I have people try to make me feel like a creep?  Why should I have to worry about someone calling the cops on me because I'm sitting alone on a bench, with no one here with me but my son, while I watch him play? Why should I be socially punished because my son deserves to have the life every 2 year old deserves? Why should I get the stares, glares, and ostracisism for literally doing my job as his father. 

I'm afraid of looking anyone. I'm afraid of interacting with someone else's kids. I'm afraid of my son throwing a tantrum when we have leave and someone calling the cops on me because they see it as a kidnapping. Why should I feel these things when I go out with my son? Its not like I like anyone else's kids, or want anything to do with them, but in the event that I have to interact, I will likely be given the third degree at minimum, just because my significant other is not here with me, because she's taking care of our newborn. 

Why should I be afraid of this? Why can I not just enjoy a day out with my son?

@I, Jupiter  its not that volatile here yet. And I could be wrong - it might turn out that nothing happens. But - I do remember when the local feminists in my own neighbourhood organised themselves to stalk me - which resulted in me being swarmed by about 20 of them in public - and I think if the police had not been present, I would have been cut with the box-cutters the feminist had in their hands.

2020-08-24 15:39:47,Sorry if this is the wrong place but I felt like sharing,"There was a story about a woman, OLGA FREEMAN, who murdered her 10 year old son (he had autism)

Never In my life have I seen so many articles, tweets and a lack of news in regards to a parent killing their child.

SO MANY people have left their SUPPORT for this murderer in articles they've written, tweets they've written.

And also I'm hardly seeing this shit in the news. ALL the photos of this woman are either selfies or other happy pictures.

&amp;#x200B;

This kind of thing has always been prevelant and this is how cognitive biases are created and maintained.

It's literally woman = good, man = bad, for a lot of people. That's just how they unconciously percieve life.

Lately it seems, if you have personal strength or power (not dominating others, just confident and strong), if you don't also have a requisite amount of softness, you're toxic. You can't just be strong. If you achieve and work and rise to the top, its a sign of privilege and you're a social problem. 

It seems since I want to go out and achieve and build a career, and I want my career be a major part of my life and identity, that Im not doing what a man should. It doesn't matter if this is what I want or what brings meaning to my life. Society doesn't support it, or me.

I hate it. I wish we could just support men being however strong, confident and powerful we want, without a threat of being labeled toxic hanging over our heads. Without being told we're a problem if we achieve.

This was done for Swedish people where alimony is non-existent and to alarm anyone moving around Europe. I put it up at Swedish politics (r/svenskpolitik) which states that anything of Swedish or European dimension of the matter is welcomed. So, I wanted to make Swedish fathers and children aware that any other European law will apply if you move abroad and that you will likely lose your children and on top of that start to pay a life long alimony (against Swedish law) according to where you live. Similar to what I have experienced in this link:

2020-08-25 02:04:47,"My father, an extremely devout Catholic, taught me not to help women who have car trouble because it can all turn against a man.","My father is incredibly kind and caring. He is the type of man who will stop his car and help someone he does not know who has a puncture or some other car trouble. 

Nowadays most cars will let you know if you have left your headlamps on but until recently you could leave your car with the lights switched on and come back to a flat battery. The custom in my country is to signal incoming drivers that they have their headlamps on by flashing your own lights. 

I noticed on several occasions that when my father was driving he always signalled to other drivers by flashing his lights so that the incoming driver would notice that they had their headlights on in bright sunshine. Then I started noticing that his fingers hovered on the 'flash light' lever when he noticed that it was a woman driving the car with the lights on.

It was difficult for me to extract from him the reason why he discriminated between men and women. But when it eventually came out he told me that a woman had complained TO THE POLICE that he was harassing her because he flashed his lights to let her know that she had forgotten to switch off her lights after exiting a tunnel. 

I've been doing this myself - Whenever I see a car with bright headlamps on in sunshine, I flash my lights. Most men acknowledge my signal, switch of their lights and give me a thumbs up or a wave as a thank you.

2020-08-25 04:32:58,Recent posts have highlighted how men are viewed with suspicion when around children. I can confirm this but we are also considered with suspicion when being kind to certain animals.,"I used to consider myself a dog person. I like big dogs but when I first started living with my partner and the subject of having children was discussed she told me that she had concerns about my large Labrador around a baby. I had committed myself to look after the dog that I adopted for life. Moreover Labradors are known to be very good around children. But I understood her concerns. My dog died about a year later and it broke my heart. She got a cat. I had never had a cat before and it got some getting used to. But I grew to like cats too. Before that I did not even know how to approach a cat or how to pick it up. Unfortunately we lost the cat in an accident.

But nowadays I like cats too and where I live there are a couple of feral cat colonies. A few women look after them, by feeding them and having them sterilised. 

Today one of the cats approached me and allowed me to pick her up. I had this sudden idea of taking her home to look after her but more importantly to surprise the mother of my son. As I opened one door of my car to put the cat inside a woman started shouting that I was stealing a cat. I immediately let go. 

These are feral cats, and they are present because some irresponsible people threw out their pets. I know that I could have just ignored the neurotic woman but I did not think that it was worth the trouble. We men seem to have this stigma of hating cats. 

I know that this is a minor issue compared to some of the problems we men face. But it kind of annoyed me that my act of kindness (to give a homeless animal a home) was met with neurotic panic. It is reflective of how we men are viewed as uncaring and violent beasts.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ifx79f/recent_posts_have_highlighted_how_men_are_viewed/,zogins

Okay so story: It's stupid.

&amp;#x200B;

March 2020: I matched with a girl on Tinder. A consensual hook up was going to happen. Raunchy language (this will be relevant) was used by both of us. ""I can't wait to be dicked down"" - Her.

No Pics Were Ever Sent Or Exchanged Throughout This Entire Story.

Unfortunately, my headass fell asleep before she came over. If I am being completely real, I did not find her too attractive and I was exhausted. I was in recovery from a Traumatic Brain Injury and dealing with senior-year college coursework.

&amp;#x200B;

*Pandemic Intensifies* 

&amp;#x200B;

May 2020: After two months of not talking to her/ghosting her, I hit her up if she was down to hang out one of these days (I should've just used my hand). She was not interested any more.

Okay, whatever.

&amp;#x200B;

End of July 2020: I started drinking alcohol again after a seven month dry hiatus‚Äîabstinence helped with recovery. Well, I fucked up, I know I should not have done this, I regret it. I drunk texted her using my Google Voice number one night. Oof. Short conversation, asked if she wanted to have a threesome with another guy of her choice, I KNOW I AM AN IDIOT. She knew it was me because I super liked her on Tinder just before that.

Deleted my Google Voice account (and Gmail) right after that. I never plan on hitting her up with a sober mind. I am sorry, I have taken the steps to prevent drunk texting on anyone ever again with the help of some friends.

&amp;#x200B;

She filed for a Civil Restraining Order‚Äîended up becoming a permanent order for 3 Years. I am never going to see or text her ever again in my life, like I graduated college, I am about to enter the workforce. I was a drunk idiot. I didn't even swear in my texts. 

&amp;#x200B;

Although it probably won't happen, what could a young man do to prevent false accusations that I texted her in the future? 

This is my list so far:

1. Deleted all traces of her number.
2. Deleted most of my social media (I don't care about social media anyways).
   1. No Burner Phone Number Apps on My Phone
      1. No VPNs on my phone.
3. Installed Google Maps on my phone to always track my location.
4. I have an app that tracks my sleep via my Apple watch.
5. She does not know where I am from (neither do I know where she is from).
   1. Different County Than My University.

Seeing these things always make me sad because men are being painted as the perpetrators of these horrible crimes and women the victims. 

Take a look at feminism, that's where it's confirmed. Crimes perpetrated by women against men barely ever make it onto the mainstream media. 

Despite me being aware of this double standard, It still makes me feel like a monster. Despite not ever considering doing these horrible things.

2020-08-25 22:26:20,"I had a girl message me a video of another girl explaining why it's alright to say kill all me so I typed this response, wanted to share it with ya'll.","The girl in the video is the same stuff we see saying basically kill all men doesn't actually mean kill all men, it's just a form of rhetoric to use against the oppressors. She says it's a power dynamic since women are oppressed they can say kill all men. Of course this is stupid and if a 8th grade student fresh out of their argumentative essay class looked at it they would realize the logical fallacies. The following is the response I sent to her.

&amp;#x200B;

There is no defense for saying kill all men. It‚Äôs a call to violence against a specific demographic. If like she said it‚Äôs ""rhetorical,"" then they need to get better rhetoric because asking for the death of a specific demographic is terrible and helps no one. Black people killed 1000 people more than white people in 2018 while only being 14% of the American population. Does this mean I can parade around saying kill all black people since clearly in this situation I‚Äôm more likely to be killed by a black person? No it would be ridiculous to tie the crimes of a few black people to all black people. If you can‚Äôt substitute other religions, races, genders etc to ‚Äúkill all men‚Äù without sounding like modern Hitler, it‚Äôs not because the substituted characteristic is the oppressor it‚Äôs because the logic is flawed. As long as there is a separate set of rules for what is socially acceptable to say and act based on gender, race, or ambiguous ‚Äúoppression‚Äù then the end goal of equality can never truly be achieved as you are fighting to get there with and by perpetuating inequality.",1.0,1.0,1.0,76.0,/r/MensRights/comments/igd7br/i_had_a_girl_message_me_a_video_of_another_girl/,Geeekus

2020-08-26 03:46:36,I think people get confused about female rapists,"I don't have to tell you guys that man people, both women and men, take female rapists less seriously than male ones.  Some people don't even believe that it's possible, which is a total myth.  

I believe this is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of male humanity and male sexuality.  First, it's a myth that men always want sex.  Second, people mistake men's sexual fantasies for reality.  Who didn't have a crush some time about a sexy teacher?  I certainly did.  Someone might think that a 14 year-old boy would simply be in hog heaven if an attractive female teacher slept with him.  The truth is, he probably would be thrilled about that, at least for a time, but that doesn't make it right.  How is he going to feel when she moves on to her next flavor of the week, discarding him as if he were a used tissue?  Boys of that age have raging hormones and don't have the emotional maturity to deal with the roller coaster ride that is sex and relationship.  A sexual relationship of a 32 year-old woman doing a 14 year-old isn't even remotely close to being an equal emotional playing field.  She's a criminal using a boy.  When his first sexual encounter is that of a grown woman using him, he'll always have those memories flooding back later in life when he attempts relationships with women.  The people who think that can't harm the kid are confusing their sexual fantasies with reality.  And they don't understand male sexuality.  Men, and especially young boys, can and do get hurt emotionally.  We're taught all our lives to hide our pain or face negative social consequences.  If a young boy gets hurt by a woman using him this way, he'll likely do a pretty good job hiding his pain, but that does not mean that the pain isn't there and isn't real.  It doesn't mean that that pain hasn't damaged his future sexual life.  

I know a lot of dudes will think, ""Wow, if I could have done Miss Whitaker in the 7th grade, I would have been thrilled.""  That's your sexual fantasies clouding your understanding of reality.  And women's understanding of the issue gets clouded as well because the understanding of young boys is so skewed in our culture.  A female teacher who has sex with her 13, 14, or 15 year-old student is a rapist.  One who has sex with an 18 year-old student hasn't committed statutory rape under the law, but she has betrayed the trust that the school has put in her.  In that case, she would still be fired and lose her teacher's license.  In the case of her having sex with an underage boy, she should be fired and lose her license, plus she should be prosecuted.  

It's true that the female teacher cannot get an underage boy pregnant.  However, due to our unjust laws, it's possible for the boy she raped to later be legally bound to pay child support for the child who is the result of his being raped.  That's a horribly unjust law that should be changed.  A 14 year-old boy isn't even in the neighborhood of the intellectual and emotional maturity needed to decide whether he wants a child.  

I just wanted to speak out on this because I've felt very frustrated by the double standards.  You can be guaranteed that if a male teacher had sex with a 14 year-old female student, that would be taken very seriously.  When it's a 14 year-old boy who got violated in the same way, people let fantasy take over.  

We have seen the female rapists in cases like these prosecuted, and that's a good thing.  However, they have a way better chance to get light sentences than any male offender would.",1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,/r/MensRights/comments/igjjsu/i_think_people_get_confused_about_female_rapists/,TigPlaze

2020-08-26 11:38:17,My earliest childhood memory is behind put under anesthesia for circumcision.,"Before you call BS I‚Äôll start by saying I was circumcised at 3 years old.

I am recently divorced and started dating someone new. This person is completely different than anything someone would label as my ‚Äútype.‚Äù When we started dating it was as though we had known each other forever, naturally our relationship progressed relatively quickly and in the beginning we openly discussed anything and everything. We would ask each other questions with virtually no boundaries. One day she asked me how I felt about being circumcised, she acknowledged the unfairness of it but also the guilt she partially carried because she was almost groomed to believe that it was cleaner or proper. Several weeks later she asked me what my earliest childhood memory was.

For some reason I had never thought about this before at all, but I answered her. It was my circumcision, and I was 3. I remember being put under, the cherry smell of something they rubbed under my nose, handing me my teddy bear, telling me to count to 10 and hearing them count as I was wheeled down a hallway laying in a hospital bed. I remember never making it to ten, I remember waking up and thinking that it was like I just blinked. The next memories is the pain I undergone during my healing. The stitches and the wound would dry and stick to my underwear at first, when I went to go to the bathroom the pain that I remember was terrible. I remember my mother lining my underwear with petroleum jelly and outside of some discomfort this took away the problem I just mentioned. 

Why I was circumcised at 3 and not at birth I don‚Äôt really have a logical answer. I remember my parents telling me as I asked when younger that it was something my father wasn‚Äôt sure he wanted done (I believe he is uncircumcised.) I guess sometime 3 years later my fate was decided. 3 years of age was rough for me as I was also later diagnosed with Mononucleosis and I remember that as well. 

It wasn‚Äôt until I answered these questions that she asked me that I realized that this was a pretty traumatic experience for me. I‚Äôm not claiming it dictates my daily life or decisions I make, or that I possess PTSD or anything remotely close. I am only pointing out that there is a reason I remember this, and not pleasantly I might add. I‚Äôm not sure how I feel about it. I don‚Äôt resent my parents because quite honestly I never have, and I‚Äôm not the type to just make things up that have no factual or emotional basis. I can‚Äôt speak for infants but I can‚Äôt imagine they are much more comfortable than I was, I was just unlucky enough to remember my experience.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MensRights/comments/igrkhu/my_earliest_childhood_memory_is_behind_put_under/,Almostf_amos

Screenshot: https://i.redd.it/jdaumdlreob51.jpg

&gt;**To Make Orchestras More Diverse, End Blind Auditions**: If ensembles are to reflect the communities they serve, the audition process should take into account race, gender and other factors.

For those who don't know, some 30+ years ago feminists popularized the idea that women were discriminated against in things like job interviews and music auditions.

There was even a study published which claimed to back that up.

However, more and more evidence keeps coming in showing the opposite: that it's really men who are being discriminated against. Meaning that men excel in some of those fields not because of discrimination, but *in spite* of it.

In fact it may even be the case that discrimination against men is what leads to more men being accepted in some of those positions in the first place.  If men are held to a higher standard in order to be on the same footing as women, they might practice more and put in more effort to overcome that bias. 

Anyway that original study I mentioned has since been debunked.  People still quote from it though. And they ignore all the evidence that's come out since then showing that it's really men who are being discriminated against.

2020-08-26 22:20:09,Modern Age Feminism explained. My TED Talk.,"Introduction:

We all know what Feminism stands for, equality between men and women. However, in recent years that meaning has decreased. Now you get radical feminists wanting female supremacy over men, also known as misandry, which is ironic. 

&amp;#x200B;

The ""Wage Gap"":

Nowadays, you get feminists who bitch and moan about a supposed gender wage gap, completely ignoring factors such as maternity/paternity leave, as well as how men are statistically more likely to work overtime more often than women. They also ignore how the equal pays act was passed in 1963, hence making it illegal to pay any gender less than the other for the exact same amount of hours worked.

&amp;#x200B;

Death rates:

Feminists also like to state facts such as 4 women every day are killed. This is tragic yes, but women only accumulate 25% of all victims of violent crimes, with the remaining 75% being male. Men also make up 91% of all workplace fatalities, with women only making up the remaining 9%.

&amp;#x200B;

Domestic Abuse:

There are currently 66.65 million people living in the UK, and despite the fact that 500,00 victims of domestic abuse a year are male and yet although there are 78 spaces in domestic abuse shelters for men, only 20 of these are dedicated to male victims.

&amp;#x200B;

Rape and False Accusations:

 Men also accumulate are large amount of rape victims, and yet when men come forth, society laughs at them and tells them to man up. A woman can also ruin a man's life with a false rape accusation, ruining any chances that he has at a scholarship and have his kids taken away from him, all with a false accusation. When it's found out that is is a false accusation the woman suffers virtually no repercussions if any.

&amp;#x200B;

Crime and Court Related Problems:

In courts women have a significantly easier time than men. Take child custody for example, the mother, or a female family member, is almost guaranteed custody of the child, whether that's sole or shared. Men also serve prison sentences which on average are 61% longer than prison sentences that a woman would have for the same crime. There was a case where a woman murdered her newborn within an hour of giving birth, buried the corpse in her garden, cried in court, and got of without any repercussions from the court.

I am a victim of certain sex abuse and trauma in my life. At my university, I began to look for resources given for therapy and help. I noticed they had free therapy open to anyone, yet also exclusively had therapy for women only. 

I believe this to be a violation of title IX because it is discrimination based on sex, as I am excluded for no other reason than being male. 

Although they DO offer therapy to everyone in the other department, the existence of the department that excludes males reflects discrimination, disproportionate funding, and an overall hostile environment where I am treated as lesser. 


Should I file a title IX Complaint? They can be done anonymously. My only concern is my name getting out and being ridiculed.",1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ih7tcp/considering_filing_a_complaint_against_my/,wumbo-inator

He started talking to me and his  father about how men are oppressed in the western world and women have  it so much better. While at first I didn‚Äôt give it much attention, this  attitude grew larger and larger. He started commenting bad on posts made  by women on Instagram. For example, his cousin shared an amazing art  she made and shared the picture on Instagram and my son called her an  attention whore for including herself in the picture. On another post  written by my daughters friend about how she‚Äôs struggling with something  he wrote ‚Äúboohoo men have it x10 worse and if we complain u girls will  just laugh at them‚Äù.

Yesterday he  left his laptop opened while he was out and he didn‚Äôt log out of his  reddit account. I took a look at the subreddits he is following and  there are many hate towards women there. I also read his comments and  dm‚Äôs and this is when I decided that I should make my son delete his  reddit account.

And they routinely fight against divorce law reform and equal child custody for men.

https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/21752-karen-decrow-last-now-president-to-support-shared-parenting-dies

The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was championed for by the feminist establishment and all it did was replace a perfectly fine gender neutral domestic violence law with a gendered one that discriminates against male victims.

http://www.saveservices.org/pdf/SAVE-VAWA-Discriminates-Against-Males.pdf

The Feminist Majority Foundation, spearheaded by Katherine Spillar, has pushed for discriminatory sexual assault and domestic violence laws.

*Ms* magazine, which is the largest feminist publication on the planet, has helped them in the past but rallying up their readers to support them.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ds09dz/how_feminists_have_defined_rape_and_influenced/

But do you ever see feminists standing up against this kind of thing?  Do they ever organize protests or write letters to NOW or *Ms* to express their displeasure? Perhaps even under the context of telling them not to do it because it makes other feminists look bad?

No, in fact they often do exactly the opposite.  They stand behind the rhetoric that those are ""radical feminists"" or they will straight up deny that it is a problem.

A quick *""you know you're right, the movement isn't perfect and we've been working on that recently""* is all we really need. Acknowledge the problem, work on it, and then be a good ally.

But all they do is pretend that it's not an issue.  Which only helps defend ""radical feminism"" and therefore exasperates the problem.

A ""true feminist"" who ""supports gender equality"" should be equally as upset about this as anyone else. 

So where are these ""true feminists""?  Are they perhaps ex-feminists now?  Do MRAs count as ""true feminists"" at this point?

Sisko Brunni found in her article ""Can our sons talk after all"" that 6-7-year-old boys are not necessarily lacking behind in language. They namely can define words much better than girls.","For girls it's typical to ""define"" a word by a haphazard association: ""cat is cute animal, really cute"". Boys, on the other hand tend to define words pretty amazingly well: ""a cat is a domesticated animal that has fur and eats mice and don't like water"". 

Interesting. Why do boys fall behind - and so quickly - in everything that has to do with language if they are actually better than girls at that age in a very important way. Knowing what words mean is, after all, the foundation of any scholarly work. 

Brunni also found that boys use more direct language: ""sit down"", take that"". Although they know how to speak in a nice way as well if any hostility arises. Girls talk indirectly. 

The differences were not massive but remarkable, anyway. I wonder if teachers know anything about this.

2020-08-28 05:19:45,Friend was Falsely Accused of Child Abuse,"R - One of my best Friends, was one of my groomsmen 41 yrs old

N - Former good friend, also was one of my groomsman 40 yrs old

M - My ""niece"" 19 years old-  daughter of N's Cousin

E - Daughter of my Niece just turned 2  


TL:DR - Ends happy, N is no longer in anyone's life

This all happened late 2019 and early 2020  


I found out after R attempted to commit Suicide  


R owns his own home and was renting out his basement suite.  My Niece needed a place.  $600/month for a 2 bedroom Basement suite all utilities and internet included.  So she moved in.

It was working great for all of them.  Her father was not happy with it due to the age difference.  But like a good man he said is peace and let her decide for herself.  

Turns out that N did not like the fact that M was living with R.  He has become very selfish as his life had a lot of downs.  While the rest of us have moved on, own our homes, married, kids, etc...he has not grown up.  He had major problem with the age difference.    


Well N called the Police on R claiming that R had raped M and beat her and E.  N accused R of pedophilia.  The police came 4 times.

They took pictures of the girls in the Underwear to prove they did not have any bruises multiple times.  The police treated R as if he was guilty of everything he was accused of.  This happened 4 times over 2 months. 

The police told M that if it kept happening that Child Protective Services would get involved and take away E.  So M moved out.  The police did not care that she had every time confirmed nothing happened, R is not that kind of person.  R has actually been the victim of SEVERE Domestic Abuse by several past partners, including permanent neurological damage.  


If not for a neighbour checking up on R he would not be here anymore.  He was ready to end it all over those accusations.    


Took a few months to find out it was N who called the police.  


Nothing R or M can do about it legally.  N's own family will not speak to him anymore.  He is forbidden from seeing his niece and nephews, his brother in law HATES HIM(also good friend of mine).  His own mother will barely speak to him.  


M is back with R now and things are good.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ihttwo/friend_was_falsely_accused_of_child_abuse/,NotSoHappyApple

2020-08-28 05:53:58,My opinion on onlyfans,"Hello, 

I currently do not respect the girls (and some guys) on onlyfans and believe they are trash. 

A common argument is that they‚Äôre ‚Äúempowered‚Äù by taking control of their sexuality and making money from men objectifying women. 

However, I think this is because we ONLY see women as the victim and men as the villain. 


Women are born with inherent value. Their sexuality is valued and cherished. They could get laid in 30 minutes if they want. Guys chase them. 

Men? They are worthless unless they provide something. Their sexuality is literally worthless. Their genitals are mutilated at birth, people laugh when they‚Äôre raped, and they are seen as ugly if they aren‚Äôt ripped. 

Their only value is what they provide. Other than that? Worthless. 

So women have inherent value and men have to have money to be worthy. 


These women use their inherent female privilege and take advantage that men are left desperate. So they use their cherished sexuality to take money from men pressured to work because that‚Äôs all they‚Äôre valued for. 


Why are the majority of the sellers women and buyers men? 

Because people love and cherish women‚Äôs sexuality, and men have been trained and conditioned that if they‚Äôre to be ANYTHING to a woman. They have to pay. These women see that and manipulate broken, desperate, lonely men by exploiting this sexism. 

The same way women expect men to pay for dates. The same way women don‚Äôt marry a man who makes less. The same way they‚Äôll take a step back in danger and expect you to die for them. Men are a resource to be used and extracted, so they can provide and give to the women with inherent value. 


I find it sad that when people debate onlyfans they act as if it‚Äôs all these corporate misogynistic pigs. When in reality it‚Äôs just broken boys who have been trained at birth to believe they are worthless unless they pay women. Whether it be on onlyfans or dates. 

Also, I find it odd how they complain women are objectified by men but are the first to objectify themselves and screech ‚Äúempowerment!‚Äù 

They say guys do it to themselves. They pay for it. Yes it‚Äôs true but girls use men for money. They cause it too. 


Imagine if men kicked women out of the workplace or harassed them and said ‚ÄúYEAH MALE POWER! That‚Äôs what they get! Wanna treat us like slaves to make money? We‚Äôll beat you at your own game!‚Äù 

But no. We see women as victims and men as villains in all areas of life. This is why I hate onlyfans",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ihug93/my_opinion_on_onlyfans/,wumbo-inator

In both cases my post was deleted very quickly for one, and after a few days for the other.  For the one that was deleted slowly, it appears to be because in that case people were sympathetic to what my experience as I recounted it, and in particular one abusive user about97cats who wrote a long defamatory post about me, removed it when I responded calling him out and people sided with me.

Why do I mention these things - because they show that in our culture and society female narcissism is extraordinarily enabled and in fact NOT ENABLING female narcissism will get one de-platformed, banned, abused, et cetera.  In other words, not enabling female narcissism, in our cultural context, is evil.

WHAT THE FUCK?  

AND WHAT THE FUCK CONSEQUENCE SHOULD WE EXPECT FROM THIS?

Well, firstly, women with narcissistic personality disorer will have absolute free rein over children.   The psychologically normal fathers of their children will inevitably exit, stage left, and there is no buffer between the the pathological female narcissist and small innocent children.  This should be expected to create extraordinary burdens of mental illness once these children reach adulthood, both in the form of narcissistic and other cluster B personality disorders, but also in other mental disorders like schizotype disorders.  AND IT WILL BE THE FATHERS FAULT - because, even though the courts and the society, media, police, child protection, etc allowed his isolation from the children and the narcissistic mother's domination of them, IT CAN'T BE HER FAULT.

The problematic characteristic of someone with narcissistic personality disorder is that nothing is EVER their fault, always an external agent is the cause - and remember, our society ENABLES female narcissism, and PUNISHES anyone who DOES NOT ENABLE female narcissism.  So this epidemic of mental illness that awaits us will be, 'because the father didn't care, and abandoned the children' the saintly mother victim, 'did her best', and was 'like an angel to those poor children, but the father just did nothing for them!'. 

So some father, who against his will had nothing to do with the raising of the child who is now a mentally ill adult is at blame, and the mother, who society backed to the hilt every step, is the victim. WHAT THE FUCK?

Now, I do, personally, believe that many women leading the sharp-edge of feminism are women with severe narcissistic personality disorders.  Not garden variety 'yes women' feminists, they're just like everyone else going along with the current trying not to rock the boat, and to do the best for those they live in the process.  But the ones always pushing things further, trying to marginalise men further, erode mens rights further, increase the psychic distress further to break down more and more men, I am confident that most of them suffer from cluster B personality disorders.

I shared an issue I was having with a mentally ill girl I met online who I since decided to cut out of my life.  The purpose of the post was to get feedback, and for the short time it was up until moderators deleted it (at NarcissisticAbuse and JustNoSO).  The blowback I got now from that is Reddit sending me an unsolicited message suggesting I think about NOT COMMITTING SUICIDE despite never mentioning self-harm, other harm, significant emotional distress, or suicide in any post.

So Reddit is putting suicide into the minds of people whose post history shows no engagement with the concept themselves.  Nice one Reddit.

I would consult with a lawyer.

If I were you I would consider showing the school any court orders giving me joint custody or a marriage license and birth certificate. 

If I felt that they were discriminating against my child on the basis of my gender as a caregiver, I would warn them that they may be in violation of Title IX.

I would warn them that their sex based harassment is severe and creates a hostile environment for caregiver fathers and their children.

""In order to give rise to a complaint under Title IX, sexual harassment must be sufficiently severe, persistent, or pervasive that it adversely affects a student's education or creates a hostile or abusive educational environment. For a one-time incident to rise to the level of harassment, it must be severe.""

‚ÄúIntentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED; sometimes called the tort of outrage)[1] is a common law tort that allows individuals to recover for severe emotional distress caused by another individual who intentionally or recklessly inflicted emotional distress by behaving in an ""extreme and outrageous"" way.[2] Some courts and commentators have substituted mental for emotional, but the tort is the same.[1]‚Äù

2020-08-28 11:37:46,"Kings of Democracy Podcast: Circumcision, the Cause Without a Rebel","Hello!  I run Kings of Democracy, an American history/comedy podcast about the people, places and things of American life.  We just did an episode on the history of Circumcision, particularly in America.  This was a really interesting episode for us, when I started researching this I had no idea of the scope and scale of American circumcision.  More American men are circumcised than like Tom Hanks.  We've exported Circumcision to other countries, in fact we invented it in South Korea.  We talk about how...

\*Circumcision's roots in deep, ancient pre-modern history as a cultural ""identity symbol""

\*The fall of circumcision in the Greek/Roman world

\*The rise of circumcision as a symbol of class status AND as an anti-masturbation technique

\*The near universal status of circumcision as a nearly unquestioned medical while the medical establishment starts to question it's usefulness and morality.  

&amp;#x200B;

We're a history and comedy podcast so this is a lighthearted look at what I see how as a pretty serious issue, but if you're looking for a deep dive on the issue take a listen.

I had a quick scroll threw posts there, as the name of sub suggested for it to be a completely simple and peaceful place to advice women how to date, regardless amount of sexism there is insane, and it's not just users, the flairs and rules are the same. 

**Let me quote their Rule 2:**

 *""****All Advice Should Focus On Maximum Female Benefit***

*All comments and posts should be focused on how the woman can derive maximum benefit for herself, and herself only. Mutual benefit should be a byproduct, not a goal.""*

Either way, I decided to use Discussion flair, which completely fit my post and write down politely my statement. I got first place muted, 10 minutes later banned. I assumed before posting that people of this sort might be too deluded to let any criticism to them, so I screenshotted post before sending it. Ofcs for a place like that, posts require admin's approval, and mine obviously didn't get approved.

2020-08-29 17:39:54,Response to accusations of misogyny,"Hello, I recently made a post about my disapproval of onlyfans. A lot of people who disapprove of it are called misogynist for shaming women for making money off their bodies. Here is my response. 

Why is it not okay for men to objectify women, when they do it as soon as they realize they can make some money off of it? 


Why is it that when they take advantage of lonely, emotionally broken men, it‚Äôs because they ‚Äúare objectified so might as well make some money off of it.‚Äù Couldn‚Äôt you just as easily say that it‚Äôs because of their sexual VALUE while men‚Äôs sexuality is not cared for? (Genital mutilation, nobody caring when they‚Äôre raped.)  this is another example of how women are seen as victims and men as perpetrators and villains. 

Same way we are worthless unless we provide, work, and make money... but then are vilified because men make slightly more. 


Same way women can beat men, call the cops, and have him taken to jail. 

These aren‚Äôt isolated incidents. The man is ALWAYS wrong and the woman is ALWAYS right and ANYTHING she does she can just use victimhood and men being terrible to justify her actions. 

Or what about the argument ‚Äúit‚Äôs MY CHOICE‚Äù

Wtf? It‚Äôs my choice to go kick puppies or spit on the homeless too... is that okay? No. Because it hurts others. 

So yes it is your choice to hurt lonely, broken guys for money. But that doesn‚Äôt make it okay. 


At the end of the day. I see it like this. Do you want to see humans do their best? If so, you wouldn‚Äôt be manipulating and using the hurting ones for money. 


I‚Äôd also like to reiterate that the reason it‚Äôs almost all women making money from it and all men being hurt from it is partly because women are seen as sex objects but ALSO because 

Women‚Äôs sexuality is cherished and mens is worthless (nobody cares about male rape, genital mutilation)

And women are inherently valuable, while men are worthless unless they provide something. This creates a dynamic where a woman is entitled to male attention and a male must PROVIDE if he wants to exist. Whether it be paying a woman in the form of paying for the dates, because he should be LUCKY she‚Äôs with him and she‚Äôs ENTITLED to be cared for, or whether it be onlyfans. 


Women making money from onlyfans is partly a symptom of women being objectified... but it‚Äôs also a symptom of them being valuable and men being invisible. But hey.... women are victims and men are villains.",1.0,1.0,1.0,28.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iipr25/response_to_accusations_of_misogyny/,wumbo-inator
2020-08-29 19:19:20,IKEA airs sexist commercial about vegan meatballs. Everything about this commercial is disgusting,"So, in my country (Hungary), and possibly elsewhere (I don't know, but the commercial sounds like a mass produced one), this commercialnis everywhere - billboards, internet ads, TV. 

https://youtu.be/uc1k3aNsP4k
https://youtu.be/vszn2t4Gdjc
https://youtu.be/ybQJMi7P26g

The commercial is essentially woke vegan lady convincing dumb meat-eating male that IKEA vegan meatballs are just as good as the originals, while saving the planet. 

Nevermind that this is vegan propaganda from a country that uses Uyghur slave labour - they had the audacity to air it with the motto #kellhozz√°goly√≥, which essentially means ""you need balls for it"", making it completely about men not protecting the environment. 

This might not ge as offensive to you guys as it is to me, but considering Hungary was a pretty traditional country until this point, and still is, I think this is about as offensive as it gets without going full woke and yelling patriarchy.",1.0,1.0,1.0,28.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iiqrjb/ikea_airs_sexist_commercial_about_vegan_meatballs/,Amazing_Rope_Police

However we understand that less progress will be made with fewer voices and less dialogue. We encourage you to share your opinions, experiences, and voices to help contribute to our goal in helping alleviate issues that modern men face. 

&amp;#x200B;

Belonging to this sub does not mean that we hate women or don't care about the discrimination that you face; most of that hate that comes from this sub is geared towards the blatant media biases and hypocrisies. Similar to the BLM movement this sub is a place for ALL of us to focus on men's issues and progressive ways to help make live better for our fellow brothers, fathers, and sons everywhere. We encourage all who wish to help to participate!

&amp;#x200B;

It is important that our ideas, posts, and methods are questioned, discussed, challenged, and even sometimes ridiculed; this is all part of a healthy dialogue and will move our cause forward.

&amp;#x200B;

It would be a disservice to ourselves and our focus to be dismissive of any voices that hold genuine opinions and ideas. We understand that Reddit is a male dominated space, and this sub more so, But I would like to extend a personal invitation to any and all women who want to be heard in this sub to do so, and I challenge all the men in this sub to listen and hear what our female comrades have to say. Its not easy to walk into the lions den and feel safe, so we have a responsibility to foster an environment where discourse is valued.

&amp;#x200B;

We've seen enough hate from enough hateful subs, and it starts with being dismissive. So we at r/mensrights just want to let you women know that your opinions and experiences are valid, welcomed, and appreciated here.

2020-08-30 02:29:43,TV series that reverses the usual plot lines and shows men as the oppressed and objectified gender.,"I've started watching a TV series called ' Spernatural' which follows the adventures of 2 brothers. Throughout the series women manipulate men, drag them into trouble and are in general a reflection of what happens in real life.

What I like about this series is that it shows how us men love and protect our brothers, children and wives, often ignoring our own safety.

The subject matter is the occult and demons often take the form of women who seduce men and then harm them.

I know that this is just a fun tv series to watch but it is good that the writers do not fall for the usual stereotypes.

2020-08-30 02:50:30,How children brought up without a father yearn for a male presence in their lives.,"Several years ago, before I settled down and started bringing up a family I used to go out with a girl who was really decent and she always found different things for us to do.

Once, around Christmas she suggested that we go and visit an orphanage and take some small presents for the children. The children were all very young - under 5 years - and they were looked after by nuns. Because they lived in a nun's convent they only ever saw women.

We bought sweets and some small toys and she arranged for us to visit. I was still in my early 20s and had never felt that I wanted to be a father. 

We were shown into the kids' playing area and while my girlfriend chatted to the nuns and handed them the sweets for the kids. I sat down on the floor and the kids came crawling up to me, many of them started tugging at me and calling me 'daddy'. They had never seen me before but I must have been one of the very few men they ever saw. It broke my heart and I am not ashamed to say that I was overwhelmed with emotion. I felt that I could not take it because I felt so helpless. Some of them hugged me and I ended up with tears streaming down my face.

Several years later when I was in the steady relationship in which I am now, I visited the nuns on my own and asked to talk to the mother superior. I asked her why all these children were not adopted seeing that there were so many couples who could not have children of their own. She told me that their biological mothers refused to sign the papers allowing another couple to adopt. These were women who could not bring up their own children for several reasons; some were substance abusers, others were in prison while others had declared that they did not know ho the father was and that they had no means to bring up children. So they were happy to see their children rot in an orphanage rather than let a stable couple bring them up. 

Even though we now have a son of our own I would not be against adopting a very young child.",1.0,1.0,1.0,22.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iixvzx/how_children_brought_up_without_a_father_yearn/,zogins

2020-08-30 10:07:18,"The ""Karen"" stereotype and the evolution of feminism.","I've been mulling over this idea in my head lately. Whereas even 2 or 3 years ago, it was almost unheard of to see women spoken of badly in the ""woke"" mainstream press, now even Buzzfeed and the NYT have frequent features on Karens.   
Buzzfeed even had an article where they said ""you might be a Karen if you've ever made a false accusation"" (!)   


So, a few thoughts come to mind:   
\- I think most people who have any familiarity with Men's issues can recognize the Karen stereotype as everything we've always been saying about feminists.   
\- Maybe this is a controversial thing to say, but feminism appears to be a giant psyop, which can be traced back through the Frankfurt school, Auguste Comte, Rousseau, and back probably further than that. The main custodians of this idea for most of history weren't women, they were men who wanted to steal your girlfriend.   
\- It seems to me this psyop is evolving to show its true anti-woman face. ""Karen"" is the most obvious example, but also witness J.K. Rowling's ongoing argument with the trans lobby, or even Cardi B's ""WAP"", which glorifies pure exploitation. Rose McGowan recently said she's not a feminist, and a lot of people seem pretty fed-up with the whole woke thing.  


I'm curious if anyone has an idea where this is headed. The simple answer might be a right-wing backlash, but since I am equally anti-Trump and anti-woke... well, I have a theory about the ultimate goal in all this (""It was the year they finally immanentized the eschaton"",).

2020-08-30 15:18:44,"Three major groups that strive for or, at least, tolerate inequality between the sexes, all for somewhat different reasons: ""conservatives"", ""believers"", and ""feminists"".","While washing the dishes, I started thinking which groups, in addition to feminists,""are against equality between the sexes"". And why they think so. 

This is not a well-researched essay but more like somewhat arbitrary shower thoughts. I wanted to post my ideas here hoping that someone could correct me, if I made obvious mistakes, or perhaps add something.

By **conservatives** I don't mean the vast groups which are against leftist politics. Rather, I have in mind the ""real conservatives"", the ones whose ideology is conservatism.  They think that societies should grow and change organically to respond to different challenges with the resources they have at hand, not by social engineering by the government. 

So, in their opinion men and women have different tasks because their are biologically different. Society should reflect that and thus can't be equal. Women are better suited for task in homes and men for task outside homes. So responsibilities and privileges just can't be the same in general (though individuals have the right to disagree). 

By **believers** I mean people who think that God has told people in holy scriptures how to live. So, I don't mean the majority of religious people who really don't believe that but just pretend to believe. Sometimes people think believers are conservatives. But actually they just mimic the ideas of people who lived long ago under very different circumstances. 

For example, the Jewish and Muslim societies seem to have been exceptionally patriarchal during the period when the holy scriptures were written. So, many believers end up believing in pretty strange views on women's - and men's - position in society.

By **feminists** I mean people who believe in such typical feminist views as that we live in a patriarchy which men hold up by using violence and hatred (misogyny) against women. Women are oppressed victims who don't have a chance against men in this inhumane society of ours, full of vile male values.

Feminism has similarities with both conservatism and religion. But its main problems are that it's worldview is so far removed from reality and it's view on men is so hostile. Obviously, you can't know what should be done for equality if you don't have a clue what the situation is right now. Obviously and in particular, you can't make the world more equal for men, if you ""hate"" them and their unearned privileges like the right to rape and beat up women.

Because many **leftists** (""liberals"") embrace the feminist ideas, you could argue that they are actually against equality, not just feminists. But probably that's unfair the same way it would be unfair to claim that all conservatives are against equality between the sexes. Nevertheless, it's mainly through the left feminist have gained the enormous power they now have.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ij8ri6/three_major_groups_that_strive_for_or_at_least/,accidental_me

2020-08-30 17:11:23,I wrote a short story where a men gets raped. My teacher thought the guy enjoyed it.,"So long story short, I‚Äôm an aspiring writer and I sent my latest short story to one of my teachers I have a good relationship with. The themes and reasons aren‚Äôt relevant, point is, it ends with him getting jnto a woman‚Äôs car and the woman rapes him (a virgin). My only fear regarding the scene was that I went overboard with the ‚Äútorture porn‚Äù and emphasized the psychological and physical pain of the main character to redundncy. Turns out I was wrong. In his reply, my teacher complimented how I wrote the scene and wrote something along the lines of ‚Äú...the mixture of pain, fear and the pleasure/enjoyment of the moment‚Äù 
I tried so hard to make the pain and disgusting nature of the act apparent that I feared I went overboard, but it seems it‚Äôs still not enough. Why do people have this inherent bias that men must always want and enjoy sex, even if it‚Äôs against their will?
Side note: he definitely wasn‚Äôt talking about the woman‚Äôs pleasure/enjoyment, since I made it very clear that she didn‚Äôt enjoy it in the conventional way either and sexual pleasure wasn‚Äôt the motivating factor in the act in order to make it realistic.",1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ij9x08/i_wrote_a_short_story_where_a_men_gets_raped_my/,seii7

to my understanding what had happened was that they were arguing about her wanting to go to work, my dad had told her that after flying back from a different country, that she needed to quarantine herself for at least 14 days before going out like that. it escalated to then whether or not she cheated on him while he was taking care of the kids. idk how it got this next point, but my mom started to call the police. my dad knowing that she would make a huge deal, wanted to stop her from escalating it this far.  my dad is NOT a woman beater. he tried to take the phone away but at that point it was too late and she was screaming ‚Äúhelp me help me!‚Äù my dad knew what she wanted to do so he let go of her. shortly after i made it to the bedroom. where they yelled at each other still.

the police arrived, asked us questions and well, my dad got arrested for the interference of a 911 call. they took him away just minutes ago. i can‚Äôt look at my mother. i‚Äôm heart broken. i love both of my parents, my dad has taken good care of us and so has my mom. but this is wrong, everything about what happened doesn‚Äôt feel right. my dad is not a wife beater, my dad would never lay hands on my mom to hit her. they told me that only i could bail him out. i‚Äôm still waiting to see if he calls me once he gets there. i don‚Äôt know what to do. i know i should‚Äôve given more details but i can‚Äôt think straight i hate that this fucking happens and it‚Äôs unfair to my dad. i‚Äôll delete this soon. i‚Äôm just hoping for some advice.

Please contribute, in any way you can.

This subreddit was created to facilitate reporting of subreddits that encourage violence against men and male children, which is a big thing for me.

I reached out to Reddit Administrators to let them know that this subreddit is not a recreation of previous subreddits with a similar name.

A big feature of this community is AI powered keyword search and post-indexing, which will make reporting a lot easier :)

"" 

Matt O‚ÄôConnor, founder of the campaign group Fathers4Justice, commented: ‚ÄúThe white feather movement is an appalling episode in our history, although largely ignored, or forgotten. Thousands of men, some already suffering from mental and physical injuries sustained in war were publicly shamed by Emmeline Pankhurst and the suffragettes by being labelled cowards and unpatriotic.

The white feather movement was a women led campaign shaming men to go to war by giving them a white feather as symbol of cowerdice.

I was at a large department store today, when I saw this little girl (who looked maybe 5-6 years old) playing with the belts in the men's clothing section.

I asked her what her name was, and then asked where her mum was.  She told me her name and said her mum was ""over there,"" pointing a finger in the general direction of a seemingly empty part of the store.  

I walked her over to the customer service desk, where they put an announcement over the loudspeaker saying: ""Would the mother of [child's name] please come to the customer service desk?  Your daughter is waiting for you.""  

The mother *ran* over, panicked, and thanked me for finding her daughter.  Immediately after she left, I had a security officer tap me on the shoulder and ask me my name.  

Apparently, some third-party had seen this girl grabbing my hand as I led her over to the desk and REPORTED ME TO SECURITY.   He said he was going to call the police if I didn't give him my information (including my full name and address).  He ended up getting a photocopy of my driving license and God knows what he's going to do with it.  

To some extent, I understand why people are hyper-vigilant about paedophiles, but I'm posting it here because I'm a man in my early 20s, and I *highly* doubt any woman escorting this girl would have been presumed to be a paedophile.",1.0,1.0,1.0,105.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ijje37/today_i_was_confronted_by_a_security_guard_for/,Cicurinus

2020-08-31 05:31:47,A lot on r/MensRights is sexist - Hear me out why,"This will be long, but if you are any serious about this, if you really want to make a difference, it could be a good read. I'm writing this because when I joined, I expected to get educate and to have discourse about what I can do to make the world a better place, grow awareness and how to improve my values and ethic. If your intention was the same as mine, you might be interested in what I have to say.

TL;Dr Less gossip, more progressive ideas, egos aside, keep in mind a lot of women struggle with suppression, western feminism is not the same as feminism everywhere, two negatives add up to be more negative.

First - I don't intend to make you have my opinion.

Intended Reading Outcome - You self reflect on your approach to achieving the goals with being a part of r/MensRights, or human rights in general.

About Opinion - Not intended to convince you on anything. I am pointing out a perspective everyone's happily introduced to work with in the way they want.

There are different kind of ideas of the content, political views and motivations in this subreddit.

People here are discussing progressive ideas, equality, modern thinking, often understood as a correction, completion and update to the feminist ideals.

While we have a lot of content promoting a more understanding and symbiotic idea between male and female instead of seeing these as opponents to each other.
We also have a strong idea and discussion of mens' rights and dignity under attack in this world.

The second type of content seems to be a necessity to raise awareness and make conscious about political movements seriously threatening mens rights, dignity, respect and perceived value to society.

This can be seen as a result of the western feminist movement, prejudice, social bias &amp; degradation which works ""more fair"" for women.

As we have grown awareness, as a lot of prominent figures male and female have spoken out in public about this issue, it's time to move on.

Years passed and I feel the result of ""Women are cruel to men, **too**"" in reality translates to ""Women are cruel to men (too)"" slowly drifting to ""Women are cruel to men"".

We are accusing feminists for their men shaming and not pointing out how their are men who are so wonderful human beings.
Also we are slowly falling into the habit of shaming feminism/female individuals/women without giving the respect and love to all the great women out their, all the mothers who give their best to raise the boys to become wonderful men, all the things women are throwing into the cooking pot of creating a better experience of life on earth for everyone.
I'm not saying it's the main narrative, but it's a pattern here.

Also we have a lot of high quality post that provide healthy critical thinking, non-identity biased discourse, next step analysis and so.

As we say feminist should step down from the high victim horse, let's think about our ""dumb people who will choose women over women because they are women even if man has higher competency"".

Think about it. Who is reading this? What does this person probably think and feel afterwards?
From the comments and common sense I have the feeling the only people reading this are the one whose awareness towards this issue is already raised and mostly they feel anger and confirmation of what they already know or think.

I have experienced disadvantage because I am male, also I was heavily abused by female while trying to be a good person, which I could hardly explain to anybody, but you know what I mean.
Also I know men who are close to me whose lives were ruined or a lot harder because of these inequalities.

I feel all your post, your comments, your anger and your frustration about this. This is not a board where people live in fantasy world's, it's the opposite, this is often a sanity check for a lot of people.

I want you to bear the bigger picture in mind. We can be disappointed, angry, entertained, frustrated and so on all day about the inequalities, but this won't change a lot. Also this isn't having the effect of a self help group since we are often unforgiving and cannot let go of our negativity.

IMO the solution is to debate more about progressive ideas how to make the human life experience better for everyone with the present issues, helping everyone to get their right, to support women the same as men.

Destroy the identity politics, destroy the enemy image.
The political movements often need enemy images to push them.
Do what they say about good men. Be patient. Take Gandhi for instance. If they want to fight you, don't corrupt your values in order to win.
The patient one will be slow, but he will win someday. Dont fall for the baits of hate and anger.
Be blissful and fight the fight for for everyone regardless of your identity.

As we grew awareness for the inequalities, let's try our best to work out our ethics and our knowledge to make this world a better place for our kids, so we can teach them how to be better then our generation, how to avoid the traps and different faces of hate.

Share good books on this topics that lead to ideas that help the world in our terms, instead of another YouTube video of a scripted judge reality show where the female's punishment is not hard enough.

Always try to reflect if you are on the splitting or on the connecting side.

Where is now the part where I explain the sexism of this board?
I wouldn't even say it is more sexist to any side, sometimes it's just getting angry about negative traits that are more common in females, but the idea of this thing is not to generalize assholes. Let's point out that assholes are assholes and worship the good values. Let's not make it about men too much, but keep the narrative of human rights. Keep the narrative of love even towards the people that are full of hate and nonsense and playing the socially brutal game against men as a group.

Do I think western feminism is kind of like ISIS? In terms of how they think they are reasonable in their actions and their social constructs, definetly.
Do I think MensRights should be an anti feminist meme board? Let's try to keep it to a certain degree where it doesn't become pure entertainment.",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ijl141/a_lot_on_rmensrights_is_sexist_hear_me_out_why/,GonnDir
2020-08-31 06:00:08,"TIL that the phrase ""when you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression"" originated with the men's rights community","For some reason I always assumed that the woke crowd came up with this and MRAs started using it because it made a lot of sense when applied to gender.

But it turns out that the oldest known reference to this quote comes from an MRA on Usenet in 1997.

&gt;Women like her are suffering from a condition I call ‚ÄúAdvanced Pedestalism‚Äù. Which basically means that **they [women] have been living on the high side for so long, equality looks like oppression**.

The quote is attributed to Mike Jebbett.

https://groups.google.com/forum/m/#!msg/bc.general/c8aGhd93M5A/QqAGONH4J-UJ

https://quoteinvestigator.com/2016/10/24/privilege/

What's interesting is the ""pedestal"" reference that went along with it.  This used to be a common analogy in the men's movement.

It was said that society placed women on a pedestal, meaning women were viewed and admired as being perfect and faultless.

The idea is that taking someone off their pedestal and making them ""equal"" to everyone else might be a less than pleasant experience for them.

In fact there are a few other idioms along this line that go back at least a couple of decades.

*""Equality is a bitch""* comes to mind, for example.

The men's rights movement is a little more refined than that, but this sentiment is rooted in the idea that women aren't really oppressed. And that many of the ""complaints"" we see came from a misguided understanding of what equality and privilege is.  

That's not to say that sexism and discrimination never affect women or that equality can't be a win-win for everybody. But there are contexts where women are being treated more like men. And they are interpreting some of those experiences as a form of oppression instead of equality.

It seems kind of ironic that anti-MRA types use this quote nowadays and are seemingly oblivious to its MRA origins.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ijljr3/til_that_the_phrase_when_youre_accustomed_to/,Oncefa2

I just find it unbelievable that I have to put at least half of my assets at risk of being confiscated from me in the event of a divorce, which statistically is 80% is filed by women. I can't secure my pre-marital assets because prenuptial agreements aren't even valid documents - only mere considerations. It is so unfair. I disagree with the motion that all assets become marital assets. Seriously, where is the protection for men? It makes no sense. How are millions of men getting married with this huge risk? I have to realize that in life I have to take care of myself first and foremost, but marriage is mutually incompatible with that. Even If I choose the right girl and do decide to get married, I would be worrying day and night about my assets, I'll be censoring myself to avoid upsetting her, etc. She would have so much power over me, seeing as most women won't have much in the way of having assets, and won't be bringing to the table as much as I am. Why do I have to be punished or have to sacrifice my stuff for being a good provider? It seems to me marriage works best when both parties are worth a similar amount or have similar income levels.

The only method I can see to avoid getting married is have a girlfriend with whom I can have children with, but that doesn't seem very appealing to the woman, very few will accept that sort of commitment.

2020-09-01 05:34:48,"Could ""Feminism"" be useful?","I've been reading and watching MRA content since perhaps 2012. One obstacle that quickly became clear was that MRAs are quickly dismissed in conversations about gender. Simply speaking about men's issues might invite scoffs and a wave of the hand. 

One reason for that was the number of controversies the early activists were associated with. Feminists in media wasted no time distorting public perception of MRAs.

Today as I was scrolling through the Feminist sub, scratching my head at the number of minor issues they believe are critical missions, something occurred to me.

Feminists used their network of influence and adherents to tarnish the Men's Rights movement. Large media companies seem to bend to feminist whims, and typically reject the idea of Men's Rights activism.

2020-09-01 05:38:30,The Difference Between Punching up and Punching Down,"Injustice, Inequality, and Oppression are not new phenomena. They have been a part of most Societies throughout History. White Supremacy, Racism, and anti-Semitism have been acceptable for centuries and up to very recent times. These phenomena lead to enormous atrocities.

In this nanoessay, we discuss the concepts of Punching Up and Punching Down. In the language of Social Justice, ""Punching Down"" is an act of oppressor making fun or insulting the oppressed. ""Punching Up"" is an act of oppressed making fun or insulting the oppressor.

Even though ""Punching Up"" and ""Punching Down"" both consist of verbal punching, these two actions are treated very differently. ""Punching Up"" carries much worse consequences then ""Punching Down"". This is true for an egalitarian society and it is much more so for an oppressive society. An egalitarian society contains neither oppressors nor oppressed, yet there is still some subordination. For instance, a boss is allowed to reprimand a subordinate, while an employee reprimanding his/her boss is likely to be fired. A forum, subreddit, or a Facebook group user who insults a moderator is likely to be banned. Some forums have very little tolerance for disagreement, yet this is a subject for another time.

In a Society based on Oppression and severe subordination, the Oppressed who insults the Oppressor in any way suffers severe consequences. In extreme cases, the Oppressed is not allowed to voice his grievances against the Oppressor or to criticise the Oppressor in any way. The Oppressor is allowed to subject the Oppressed to limitless Verbal Abuse and in some cases to Physical Abuse as well. Even in moderately egalitarian workplaces a boss may be allowed to yell at an under-performing worker.

Every rule has exceptions. For instance an unpopular President may be criticised by those who have no direct contact with him. In some cases genuine victims may be beyond criticism. Nevertheless, these exceptions are very rare. No Oppressor would allow the Oppressed to regularly insult him/her to his/her face.

At this point we address an odd theory which is popular in some Social Justice circles. According to this theory, ""Punching Down"" carries much worse social sanctions then ""Punching Up"". The Oppressed is allowed to insult the Oppressor at will, while the Oppressor will face severe sanctions for slightest Microaggression. In this theory, the Oppressor is not allowed to complain about actions of the Oppressed in any way, otherwise the Oppressor will face severe sanctions.

Several tweets show the absurdity of Inverted Reality presented in aforementioned theory. Eccentric Hat: ""An Oppressor, who can be silenced by the mere accusation of being an Oppressor is not an Oppressor."" Potiphar C: ""An Oppressor whom you can hate loudly and vocally, but who can't hate you back loudly and vocally, is not an Oppressor."" simension: ""An Oppressor that has no voice is not an Oppressor.""

Even though the picture of Inverted Reality is absurd at face value it can serve an important purpose to those who promote it. The vast majority of modern people value Equality. In a situation where someone who is an obvious Oppressor is abusing someone obviously Oppressed, the vast majority of people will side with the Oppressed. This presents a problem for any Oppressor in Modern Society.

Unfortunately the problem has a solution called DARVO. It means Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim and Offender. If the Oppressor has a lot of Platforms from which to malign the Oppressed, while the Oppressed is not allowed to protest, the Oppressed may seem to be the Oppressor. This would make DARVO a working strategy on behalf of the Oppressor.

To illustrate my point, I will describe a situation which happens tend of thousands of times per year in different parts of Modern Western World. Suppose, an abusive wife waits until her husband falls asleep and attacks him with a heavy object. In many cases, the husband is the one arrested and possibly prosecuted.

2020-09-01 05:48:30,I'm a woman who thinks men should have more rights to parenthood,"My parents divorced when I was a kid. My mom had me on weekdays while dad had me on weekends. She had over half custody. My mom turned out to be very controlling and strict. Say one bad word? She washed my mouth with soap. Didn't want to wear certain dolled up clothes? Too bad, because she forced me to. She occasionally yanked my ponytail to get my attention if I was distracted. Not to mention she wouldn't let me have a laptop or cell phone at all when I was under 18 because she believes modern technology is ""toxic"". My dad is my hero (so is his wife, my stepmom). They helped me mentally get through all the bs I dealt with at my mom's house. They got me a cell phone and laptop as a high school graduation present. They never punished me harsh when I misbehaved. They let me wear what I wanted. They never yanked my hair when I wasn't listening.

Even now, I'm in college and my dad and his wife are rooting for me whereas my mom (who was a college dropout) told me its a waste of time. It's a shame that my dad was never granted full custody despite how my mother acted towards me. I get counseling services through my college because of how depressed I get on occasion. I know for a fact, if it wasn't for my dad in my life, I would be a complete wreck by now. I also know for a fact that had my dad had full custody while growing up, I'd be less depressed than I am now. I was recently diagnosed with PTSD by a doctor. I have occasional nightmares of my mother. I can't believe courts don't even see this stuff.

I also know a few single young single dad's (friends from back in high school) who are trying for full custody because the mom either drinks too much, or goes out all the time with her friends and dumps the kids at the grandparents house, or has a history of DUI'S, etc. But these friends are having difficulty getting full custody. One of them is having to spend his entire college savings just to fight the battle. I think the courts should be less biased and focus more on the situation, not the gender.",1.0,1.0,0.99,123.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ik7eh8/im_a_woman_who_thinks_men_should_have_more_rights/,Fat2Fit91

2020-09-02 03:27:34,Reddit's Complete Inability To Even Conceive Of The Idea That Women Lie Is Heartbreaking To Me,"I'm specifically referring to the shooting of Jacob Blake here.  As far as I know, Blake hasn't been convicted a crime. He's been charged but he hasn't actually been convicted of a crime, yet in every thread, I see on Reddit, there are dozens if not hundreds of people celebrating the fact that he got shot.

Whatever happened to due process? Whatever happened to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence? Yes, there are protests all across the country because of this shooting but not once have I seen anyone from BLM or the Protestors side point out that the charges against him could be entirely false.

It's just disgusting and It's something I feel the need to talk about it. It's scary. Men can be accused of anything and people will believe without any hesitation or forethought whatsoever.

It's terrifying. I'm not even mad that Blake got shot, He was reaching for a knife and the police shot him, that's fine. But to somehow try to justify shooting a man simply because he was *accused* of a crime without any evidence to back up that claim is a terrible precedent that we have set for men in this country.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ikr069/reddits_complete_inability_to_even_conceive_of/,ShortTailBoa

She calls me about four days later crying saying she took an at home pregnancy test and that she is pregnant wanting me to be supportive. I'm supposedly the only dude she's been with.... I've since moved on with my life, and since she was a hookup, I had been dating a woman I'm really into while seeing her (she didn't know details but knew I was seeing others).

 I can't help but feel overwhelming hate for this woman, I havent seen an ultrasound yet, but I don't know how, if she has this kid, I'm ever going to feel anything but hate for it, I want nothing to do with either of them.

I'm really, really angry with her, to the point I don't want to even see her..and she has the nerve to ask me to be supportive to boot FOH. I'll support a miscarriage or abortion that's it.

Nope. Don't do MRA shit. I had a heated battle with baby mama and I got primary custody. It wasn't even that hard. Its super easy to get joint legal and 50 50 physical custody.

Effectively the reason men don't get custody is that they give fuck all about their kids, then complain about paying support.

I've been very involved with my child from birth, and I showed the courts that. It wasnt hard to get primary custody.

Edit: abuse is literally evidence you can show family court on why the other parent shouldn't have the kid or kids. Stop playing the victim and own trying to save your children.**

At the end of the day, they do not want gender equality.  And at this point I wouldn't be surprised if they came out and admitted to that.",1.0,1.0,1.0,130.0,/r/MensRights/comments/il6i6q/if_rape_laws_were_gender_neutral_then_men_would/,Oncefa2

Hey everyone,

Just wanted to let you know that **Saturday the 12th of September** (there's an embargo until then), a piece about **Female Dating Strategy** ([r/FemaleDatingStragegy](https://www.reddit.com/r/FemaleDatingStragegy/)), and how it has become a breeding ground for Female Supermacists, has been picked up by 80 news outlets, the most prominent ones being **Fox News, ABC, NBC and CBS**.

This data-driven story clearly illustrates the media's bias (WSJ: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/arming-women-for-the-dating-battlefield-11581138060](https://www.wsj.com/articles/arming-women-for-the-dating-battlefield-11581138060), The Verge: [https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137852/reddit-female-dating-advice-strategy-women-rulebook-memes](https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137852/reddit-female-dating-advice-strategy-women-rulebook-memes), etc.) and Reddit's reluctance to enforce their own content policy (such as Rule 1).

I hope you will enjoy it!

I will update this post with links Saturday the 12th of September.

It has sponsored a white paper, ‚ÄúMen as Allies in Preventing Violence against Women,‚Äù in which Bob Pease lays down the law: men should take part in such violence prevention, but because of their ‚Äúdominance and privilege and‚Ä¶structural gender inequalities,‚Äù they should play only ‚Äúa supporting role‚Ä¶under women‚Äôs leadership‚Äù rather than seeking to be ‚Äúleaders or equal partners.‚Äù

Pease makes another point: women deserve ‚Äúwomen-only spaces,‚Äù but men-only spaces are verboten, because excluding women ‚Äúreinforces the notion of male authority‚Äù and men ‚Äúneed to learn how to communicate outside of traditional frames of masculinity and male sociality.‚Äù (Pease, as it happens, is the author of a book called Recreating Men, which argues that men need to undergo fundamental change for the sake of women‚Äôs equality.)

The Men‚Äôs Center, in short, is not about understanding men‚Äôs psychological and emotional development and their personal and professional lives; it is about encouraging young men to feel guilty about being born male, to check their own natural male impulses and interests, to emulate (as best they can) the manners and mores of women, and to subordinate themselves, in all ways and all circumstances, to their female friends, relatives, and colleagues.

That's why we need to do everything in our power to get more women into those fields. Is this argument valid?","I'm not saying that they are completely wrong but here are a few counter-arguments:

1. You don't need to study STEM - and definitely not graduate - to start making billions
1. Perhaps 0.0001% of STEM students become billionaires
1. Almost all startup billionaires share their wealth with wives, daughters and other women (MacKenzie Scott, Melinda Gates)
1. Less than 5% of successful startups are founded by women though the share of women studying in STEM is about 30%

Let's leave these lucky outliers aside and talk about more probable scenarios: 

1. Most people will never get rich
1. You can get more money than what you can spend in a lifetime from those fields which talented women tend to choose (medicine, law, media etc.)
1. Most people wherever they work don't get the chance to contribute to anything particularly remarkable, ""change future""

But in all  honesty, it is probably true that in STEM jobs the chances to stirke at least relatively rich are better than elsewhere because of option programs combined with the rapid growth of the field.

2020-09-04 02:38:54,CMV: Equal child custody for mothers and fathers is not taken seriously enough. It should be considered a basic civil rights issue and supported on the basis of gender equality.,"I made this post in a ""debate"" sub a few days ago which got deleted for reasons that I'm sure are pretty obvious (daring to argue in favor of gender equality for men).

But I figured it might be a little more appreciated over here.

___

Equal child custody is a legal concept that switches the starting point for custody to be 50/50 between the father and mother.

In legalese it is often stated to mean that the *best interest of the child* is defined to be *a rebuttable, default presumption to equal custody*.  The terms *rebuttable* and *default presumption* means that equal custody is simply taken as the starting point in custody negotiations.  It is not a requirement that is forced upon parents. Which means that alternative arrangements can be agreed to out of court, or argued for in court in the event of a disagreement.

Note that equal child custody is not the same thing as shared custody or joint custody.  Joint custody has been interpreted by courts to mean ""weekend visitation rights"" or even ""one day per month"" in many jurisdictions. Equal custody is just that -- *equal*.  Including when it comes to time with the child as well as when it comes to making important decisions for the child.

A couple points:

####In practice this is only a thing in two US states

It is often surprising to people that this isn't already the legal standard that we go by.  I can't speak to how common it is outside of the US because I don't have a formal source for that. But what I've seen is that this is very rare even outside the US.

The two US states where this is already practiced are Arizona and Kentucky.

Source:

*2019 NPO Shared Parenting Report Card Highlights Some Progress and Great Disparity in State Custody Statutes. https://nationalparentsorganization.org/information-resources/2019-shared-parenting-report-card*

####Existing research indicates that equal custody is beneficial to children, or at least not harmful compared to giving custody primarily to the mother

There isn't a whole lot of research here but the above source links to a few studies on this topic for anyone who wants to challenge this.

Another source on this topic can be found here:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232984449_Comparison_of_Role_Demands_Relationships_and_Child_Functioning_in_Single-Mother_Single-Father_and_Intact_Families

####Academic research demonstrates pretty clearly that fathers and husbands are discriminated against in family court under existing laws

Here are a list of sources found in [this paper](https://www.law.upenn.edu/journals/lawreview/articles/volume153/issue3/Maldonado153U.Pa.L.Rev.921(2005\).pdf) in one of the footnotes:

&gt;See id. (noting that fathers who seek custody prevail in half or more cases); Mason &amp; Quirk, supra note 228, at 228 tbl.2 (citing statistics showing that **fathers won custody in forty-two percent of custody appeals, mothers prevailed in forty-five percent of cases**, and twelve percent of the cases involved some form of shared custody, including 9.2% with split custody and 2.8% with joint physical custody); Massachusetts Report, supra note 227, at 825 (finding that fathers obtain custody in 70% of cases). But see MACCOBY &amp; MNOOKIN, supra note 13, at 103-04 (finding that **mothers obtained their preferred custodial arrangement twice as often as fathers**); Bahr et al., supra note 208, at 257 (showing that **fathers in Utah were awarded sole custody in only twenty-one percent of disputed cases, mothers received sole custody in fifty percent of cases**, seventeen percent of fathers were awarded joint legal custody, and thirteen percent had split custody); Fox &amp; Blanton, supra note 101, at 261 (finding that when fathers in California sought joint custody and mothers sought sole custody, **mothers prevailed in sixty-seven percent of the cases**)

The numbers differ because different states have different statutes and legal standards. One study only shows a small bias (42% vs 45%) but others show much larger differences (21% vs 55%, ""twice as often"", etc).

Note that the Massachusettes study, which sticks out like a sore thumb compared to the rest of this research, is known to be fraudulent. And there are a couple of papers floating around that cite this source in isolation, sometimes by proxy (ie by citing a paper that cites that paper).  I'm not sure why, but many people don't want to accept that fathers are being discriminated against, so this study gets cherry picked quite a bit.

The tldr is that the data from that study actually shows that fathers who ask for custody are a full 6 times less likely to get it compared to mothers, which is obviously evidence for discrimination. The authors pulled some academic shenanigans to make the results look different from what they are though.

The history of how that happened, and how one researcher was able to get ahold of the raw data (that they attempted to suppress), can be found here:

######Rosenthal, M. B. (1995). Misrepresentation of Gender Bias in the 1989 Report of the Gender Bias Committee of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. *Breaking The Science*.
 http://www.breakingthescience.org/SJC_GBC_analysis_intro.php

Note that even these studies which demonstrate a bias in the family court system fail to show the full picture.  Mothers are given custody as a legal default in most places, and it is up to the father to find the money to hire a lawyer to fight this in court. So there is a selection bias where only the best equiped fathers with the best arguments for custody, and the most money to fight it, are the ones who show up in these sources.  *And they still tend to lose.*

One of the issues is the fact that fathers even have to go to court to request custody to begin with; it should simply be the legal default.

One last point here is that even if it were true that men and fathers were treated fairly in court, passing these laws would end up not changing anything. So why not go ahead and pass a few bills and be done with it?

####Around 90% of cases are settled ""out of court"" but this happens against a backdrop where the father knows he stands on unequal legal footing

I've seen this argument made a few times that fathers don't want custody. Which you can see when you look at ""out of court"" settlements where the father presumably gives up his custody rights freely.

The only problem with this is that these negotiations are made against an existing legal backdrop that disenfranchises fathers.

Something like 99% of all criminal court cases settle out of court, but that doesn't mean that the theoretical outcomes of those cases (if fought in court) don't influence someone's choice to settle out of court. Other factors like time and cost play a role as well.

Innocent people often take plea deals under the threat of what would happen if it were taken to court, for example.

Social norms also influence how much a father wants to be a parent.  And those norms are influenced by legal statute.  In fact if you go back approximately 150 years, fathers commonly received full custody of their children during a divorce.  That was both the legal norm and the social norm at the time.  This has only changed because our laws have changed.

So if you want fathers to be in the lives of their children more often, it makes sense to default to 50/50 equal custody.

####There is activism around this topic, and there is significant resistance to this idea

The National Parents Organization has been fighting for these laws for a really long time.

Recently there's been some progress made in a few US states for joint and shared parenting (which is a big an improvement over sole custody).  But even those laws face quite a bit of resistance from lobbying groups who want to defend the status quo.

In one famous case, a comprehensive divorce and child custody reform bill in Florida that had over 80% approval among eligible voters was shot down by the National Organization for Women (NOW). Which is a powerful lobbying group that opposes these bills pretty much everywhere that they get put up for vote.

They did something similar in Canada back in 2014 by organizing a ""walk out"" to prevent a quorum to even be able to vote on the bill.

And the crazy thing is that groups like NOW frame themselves as being ""progressive"" and advocating for gender equality when clearly they are doing the exact opposite of that.

See for example:

https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/21752-karen-decrow-last-now-president-to-support-shared-parenting-dies

####These laws provide the exact same clauses and protections for domestic abuse as existing laws

One of the claims made by people who oppose these laws is that they hide behind something that seems fair and rational on the surface only to protect domestic abusers behind the scenes.  The argument is that these bills are designed to allow abusive husbands access to their children to continue their abuse.

To begin with, that's not how these laws work.  They contain all the same provisions to adjust custody arrangements based on abuse that existing laws have.  The only thing that changes is the ""starting point"". So this is little more than just propaganda put out by people who oppose these laws (with NOW being particularly bad about it through their social media arm).

Secondly, academic research shows that mothers are just as abusive, or even slightly more abusive, than fathers are.

Acting like there's this big problem of abusive fathers, and that mothers are never abusive to their children, is itself a harmful, sexist view that is not based in reality.

https://www.odt.co.nz/news/national/children-most-often-killed-mothers

####There are other issues around child custody that need to be addressed as well

In particular, it is often the case that unmarried fathers, by default, and unless voluntarily added to the birth certificate by the mother, have no parental rights at all. A man's parental rights, legally speaking, are often tied to the mother through marriage. And while there is at least a basic presumption for partial custody during a divorce, unmarried fathers are typically presumed to have no custody at all.

In the past, unmarried mothers who didn't want their children, but also didn't want the father to have them, have put them up for adoption without the father's concent.  Such actions can even allow the mother to get out of paying child support in the event that the father is able to adopt his children.

There are laws in a few states that allow the biological father to receive preferential treatment during adoption proceedings, but the fact that a mother can even put up their children for adoption without explicit consent from the father (or at least a formal waiver from a judge), shows just how little we respect the rights of fathers.

http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/07/paternity-registry/396044/

It really should just be the case that a father is presumed to have equal rights to his children as the mother, including even if they are not married.

Another problem I've seen is the outright denial that this is an issue.  As well as related views that struggling fathers are just bad parents and deserve to be attacked and hated instead of understood and helped (like what we do for struggling mothers).

Denying this because it is inconvenient or because it demonstrates a ""different type of sexism"" that you don't want to acknowledge is harmful.  And I'd even venture to argue is an example of sexism in and of itself (ie some people can be sexist in how they approach sexism and gender equality).

This topic should be viewed as just as important of an issue of gender equality as anything else.  And the fact that we don't hear much about it really just proves how sexist society can be towards men and fathers.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ilzceq/cmv_equal_child_custody_for_mothers_and_fathers/,Oncefa2

Men have lower Vitamin D on average - and have higher rates of vitamin D deficiency - than women (independent of other conditions that lower vitamin D, like obesity).  This may be one of multiple factors that make Covid more deadly to men (especially black men, since dark skin produces less vitamin D). So fellas, get some sunlight AND get a vitamin D test at your next routine doctor's visit.  


Winter is coming. Less sun exposure means less vitamin D.  So make sure you get enough vitamin D in your diet this autumn and winter (e.g. fatty fish, eggs, fortified dairy, etc.). Or take supplements.

Why? Is the assumption that Reddit isn't reflective of culture in general and women still receive more support for caring for kids and by creating unequal support, we are helping to equalize norms? 

Is the assumption that norms should be more supportive of men being fathers and caretakers than women being mothers and caretakers?

It was completely sexist and should have been taken down, and I'm happy it was, but unfortunately there is still an issue. There is a subreddit christened r/MisandryFetish that has the exact same values and ideals, but against men, and it still stands without any action against it. I find it extremely offensive that the one where women are cast as superior is kept, but the one with men being superior is deleted. They should be a package deal, not one or the other. I strive to counter this blatant sexism and offensive double standard with the subreddit r/banmisandryfetish.

2020-09-05 05:42:39,She set me up with a pregnant girl to make me take care of the baby,"Im 19 and ive was single for a year so I asked a college classmate that's a female friend to set me up with a cute girl. She set me up and I got the girls number and we texted for 2 weeks. Everytime we texted she always wanted my full attention and even got upset if she had to wait for me to reply. She even told me she was bipolar(**moodswings**).

That Friday of the second week I asked her to go out to grab pizza with me before quarantine got in full effect!Let me say this now this b\*\*\*\*¬†didn't look anything like the pictures she took. This b\*\*\*\* was chubby and face was ugly. The only reason she looked somewhat¬†attractive was because she was young and snapchat filters.¬†

I didn't want to turn her back after she came all this way to meet me so we went on the ""**date**""¬†¬†Now listen i'm a guy that's on his purpose Im a good looking guy, my body is fit and i'm going to college for a 6 figure job. If i date this girl my value would be going down and hers would go up.

Let me skip to the part that was fucked up, the pizza came and I was getting a slice, we were talking and I heard this b\*\*\*\*\* say "" **you're gonna have to wait 6 months because i'm pregnant**"".¬†¬†I thought this was a joke so i pretended to not hear this, then she said ""**can't say i never told you**"".

When I heard that everything started to make sense. The reason why she was chubby and being bipolar(**moodswings**), She even asked me once what would you do if you got a girl pregnant and i told here if it was my child i would take responsibility and another time i heard¬†her little brother say ""**is that your ex on the phone**"" followed by her shushing her brother.

So after the date i found out a close friend died so i told her and my friend that i'm not ready for a relationship right now and guess what they both said to me!!!! ""**I wasted her time**""¬†

What do you guys thing? I really want to see how others veiw this situation. Was i wrong for dipping?

2020-09-05 08:05:19,"Arrogant and manipulative bullies have more sex, Brock U. study says","There is a thread over on Leftwingmaleadvocates where a poster spergs the below:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;When men are not able to hold a steady job they are not seen as worthy or valuable, they don't belong anywhere. When they sell drugs and get dough, or use violence to gain power, people, especially women, respect and admire them more, and suddenly they have prospects. It's more than money, it's respect, sex, love, a family. This is why the hypergamy instinct and women's own instincts needs to be held for account. Feminists would call this toxic masculinity, but it is women who select for this stuff and endorse men's most toxic instincts.

And he is completely right cause of the below article:

[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/brock-bullies-sex-1.4487053](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/brock-bullies-sex-1.4487053)

**Arrogant and manipulative bullies have more sex, Brock U. study says**

*Team wondered: Would someone lacking empathy have more sexual partners? Someone with a short fuse?*

Teens who are willing to exploit others for their own gain are more likely to be bullies and to have more sexual partners than those who score higher on a measure of honesty and humility. That's what a new study from a team at Brock University suggests.

A team including Brock associate professor of child and youth studies Anthony Volk had previously found that bullies had more sex.

They wanted to know: Was it all bullies, or just ones with particular personality traits?

In the follow-up, which was [published last month](https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40806-017-0126-4) in Evolutionary Psychology Science, they studied a comparison of different negative traits.

Would someone lacking empathy have more sexual partners? Someone with a short fuse?

**As it turned out, the variable that could be correlated to having more sex was scoring low on a measure of humility and honesty. Someone who is arrogant and manipulative, and willing to be so, is more likely to have more sex, Volk's team found.**

""That's really the only one that came up as being predictive of people taking this behaviour and using it to exploit others,"" he said. ""It's also the trait that best predicts bullying overall.""

They set up two groups: 144 older adolescents with a mean age of 18.3, and 396 younger adolescents with a mean age of 14.6.

They gave each a questionnaire about their sexual activity as well as likelihood of bullying.

Personality a bigger factor than gender

**They found that regardless of gender, teens with low humility-honesty readings were more likely to bully and to use that bullying as a strategy to have more sex.**

**""Both adolescent boys and girls will use an advantage in power to impress and get opportunities to have sex with their desired partners,"" he said. ""The best answer is that it seems to be driven by personality, not by gender.""**

The study has Volk and his team, including Daniel Provenzano of the University of Windsor,¬†thinking about what can be done to curb teen bullying. He said it boils down to this:

How do you give someone with that personality trait an alternative way to achieve what they're achieving through bullying?

**""So if you're trying to impress the opposite sex, if you're trying to impress your peers, you can do that by hurting weaker people to show off your power,"" he said. ""Or in this system that we're trying to pilot ‚Ä¶ if you give them roles in the classroom that give them that dominance and visibility.""**

**Volk said the team will be rolling out a test intervention in some Niagara-area schools in the coming year as part of an evaluation of kinds of interventions.**

**For younger students, that might look like being the door greeter at school, so everyone sees and acknowledges them on the way in.**

**""That's a way of meeting that arrogance, that self-centredness that underlies honesty-humility,"" he said.**

**""You still punish the bullying, but you have to recognize the same time that if you just say, 'Stop bullying ‚Äì we're going to punish you,' and you can't catch them in the first place ‚Ä¶ you're saying, stop having the benefits of having sex and being popular and¬†getting all the resources you want because we said so,"" he said.**

""It doesn't work. So you have to give them an alternative that allows them to still get those same benefits without hurting other people.""

\++++++++++++++++++

So bullies get more sex whereas non-bullies get nothing. 

This certainly explains all the crying you see about nice guys finish last and bad boys getting all the girls, no? 

It also explains why men who despite obeying societies dictates and have money have no children, no families or girlfriends only to then either go MGTOW, Incel, kill themselves or throw away thousands to camgirls.

Re/Undefining what it means to ‚Äòbe a man‚Äô ! 

Why some groups want to draw red lines for what a man is and is not ?! we are told 24/7 by the mainstream media that telling women how to behave or what to do is sexist. why can't we apply the same rules to men ?

Why not letting men be free from social pressure and let them define what it means to be a man for themselves ?

Why men are treated like children, why men are treated like inferior ? like broken machines that need to be fixed  !

Why it's okay for women to say that ""men need to be more sensitive"" but men telling women to do something is considered sexism and entitlement ?

All well and good but this is quote from that article.

**Some weeks it‚Äôs hard just to keep track of the number of women killed by husbands or ex-partners, so it‚Äôs perhaps not surprising if communities don‚Äôt have the headspace for the much smaller number of victims who are male** 

OK, fine, now let's look at the stats for women killed by men.

https://www.aihw.gov.au/reports-data/behaviours-risk-factors/domestic-violence/overview

According to that site it's 1 woman every 9 days, yes that is an average but jeez, that isn't even 1 a week, where are all these weeks where they can't keep track of the number of women killed by men, that means the total is 40 PER YEAR, I mean the hyperbole around this number, while 1 is too many, it sure as shit isn't an epidemic if it's only 40 per year out of a population of approx 12.5 million women. 

This is why there is such a huge problem getting help, they think that 40 people killed per year is an epidemic, so if 4 or 5 men are killed then they are meaningless in the grand scheme of things.",1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,/r/MensRights/comments/insfhh/domestic_violence_against_men_this_is_why_we_cant/,Mode1961

2020-09-07 09:38:41,"False representation, patriarchy, and rape?","I just had a long conversation with a young woman discussing societal biases, rape and rape accusations/allegations, and the power imbalances surrounding them and how they affect both men and women. 

I argued that even though through society as a whole, men have more power due to the established gender norms and other factors, there are situations where men have less or very little power. My main examples were custody battles and rape accusations. I stated that statistically, all else being equal, a man is less likely to recieve custody of his children than the woman is, by a large margin. I also stated that due to society's propensity to believe the woman alleging being a victim of rape, there is an power imbalance in the favor of the woman in the event of a false accusation, and that it can and has ruined multiple mens lives and put innocent men in prison.

Her rebuttal to those two statements were that the custody scenario was still an example of womens oppression and patriarchy because of society seeing women as birth givers and caretakers. She also stated that given the fact that society as an average favors the man, having situations where men are not in a position of power is acceptable. I argued that equality and lack of gender bias was necessary and that having bias in a judging body toward one group based on physical differences should not exist, but she saw it as necessary to believe the woman accusing over the man because of the statistical likelyhood of the accusation being true. I brought up the fact that multiple men have gone to prison on rape charges that later proved to be incorrect. She tried to get me to choose between having all the guilty rapists who went unpunished be caught  and having the innocents falsely convicted. I argued that the two were not related because having a more unbiased and accurate jury to establish guilt would improve both figures.

Her overall justification was that because patriarchy exists, then it is ok to have an inherent bias towards a woman to help balance it out, and ignoring the situations where men are the ones with no power.

As a man who has been a victim of sexual assault by a woman, it was jarring to me to hear these arguments coming from someone on a personal level. I guess I just needed to type this out and clear my head a little bit, I ended up having to leave the conversation because some of the arguments she was making were hitting pretty close to home and I was getting angry and didnt want to let that color my language or destroy any validity my arguments have because of personal emotion.

Please give me feedback, I'm kinda reeling right now and I'm not sure why I even posted this but idk",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MensRights/comments/inyfrs/false_representation_patriarchy_and_rape/,JinglesTheMighty

2020-09-07 23:19:26,I am a male domestic violence victim and it ruined my life.,"My ex gf was taking a cocktail of psych meds, narcotics, and alcohol and it unleashed hell.

She attacked me, punching me in the face, testicles, and blocked my exit.  She lost her balance and I saw my opportunity to get away from my abuser.  I left for about 20 minutes to walk along a nearby creek to figure out my next move.

I saw about 5 police vehicles at my apartment when I got home.  I already knew the story, I was fucked.  They didn't investigate whatsoever, in fact I heard the female sergeant yell ""That's the guy"" when I approached my home.

I was treated like the worst kind of criminal while they pampered and coddled my abuser.  I said nothing to the police.

I was bruised and bloody, she didn't have a scratch on her, hell she was SMILING in the police photos.

No evidence whatsoever to suggest I had hurt her or that I was intoxicated, but a mountain of evidence showing she was inebriated and had harmed me physically.

I went to trial on a bogus felony assault charge(she said I did some crazy WWE moves on her and choked her with my legs for 10 minutes).

Toward the end of my trial, the lawyers asked if I wanted to go ""all or nothing"", that is to say felony or acquittal, or add another option.  Misdemeanor assault.  They gave me 5 minutes to decide without warning.

Everyone told me to choose the 3 option trial(felony, Misdemeanor, acquittal) and I listened.  I was found guilty of 3rd degree assault because the jury said they felt bad not letting this abusive woman walk away with nothing.  NO FUCKING JOKE.

Now I can't apply for an apartment, a job, drive uber, join clubs because my background check is flagged for DV.

2020-09-08 02:40:58,I wad discussing male parental rights with a feminist.,"I am very angry about this whole situation here's how the conversation went

Me:Howdy pardon the early message but i just learned of an issue and im collecting opinions on it. Could you help me out when you get the chance?

Her: uhh sure

Me:sends her a few pictures with information on them

Her:Your asking for my opinion on each image or the general idea that the images are supporting / not supporting?

Me:The whole idea if you could

Me:And if you think it is an issue what do you think should be done
 
Her: uhh sure

Her:I agree with the first few images. Contesting to sex is in no way whatsoever consenting to parenthood. Women‚Äôs autonomy is a non-negotiable right, we have a right to our own bodies, including choosing to put it through a pregnancy or not. 
However the images that say that if you don‚Äôt want to be a parent you shouldn‚Äôt have unsafe sex I think is an unfair statement. People can have safe sex and still end up pregnant. It‚Äôs slut shaming in its simplest form. 
At the end of the day if a women gets pregnant the father can have an opinion but never the final choice. That falls to the mother. If she chooses to take the fathers opinion into account that is up to her.

Me: *visible confusion* because one of the slides addressed the not having sex and that its wrong

Me: Its not speaking on abortion

Me:It is speaking on mens reproductive rights

Me:So not the right to terminate a pregnancy but to decide if he wants part in it

Me:It is sometimes referred to as a financial abortion however i dislike that term

Her: I think that in today‚Äôs day and age if you are advocating for men‚Äôs rights it is inherently anti-women. 90% of men‚Äôs rights movements came about as anti-feminist movements. Which is crazy because feminism is for equal rights and advocate for a lot of inequalities men face in many ways as well. 
My original statement still holds up. I was looking those images from a women‚Äôs prospective. Reproductive rights still fall under pregnancy. I think that men‚Äôs reproductive rights are all that‚Äôs been focused on for years, it‚Äôs more important in this instance to advocate for women‚Äôs reproductive rights. Men have always had their reproductive rights respected. Women haven‚Äôt. At this point in time it‚Äôs more important to advocate for women and their reproductive rights seeing as in many places we don‚Äôt even have any, not to mention that people protest to take away women‚Äôs reproductive rights daily. No one does that to men. 
In short, no. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue.

Me:So if i understand you correctly: 
A lady can have an abortion even if the father wants it (which is fine)
But a father can not say that he wants no part in the child's life whatsoever?

Her: No that‚Äôs not what I said lol. Please re-read my message. I never even implied that. 

A mother doesn‚Äôt have to take the fathers opinion into consideration when deciding on going through with a pregnancy or not. It‚Äôs her body, it‚Äôs her choice. No other person gets a say over it. 

The father can say he doesn‚Äôt want to be part of the child‚Äôs life, and that‚Äôs fine. As long as he signs all the proper paperwork to terminate all parental rights legally // work out all legality‚Äôs of financial help with legal documents.

I am not happy about this. What say all of you fine folk?",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iod9nr/i_wad_discussing_male_parental_rights_with_a/,cranky_old_bastard73

Men have always had their reproductive rights respected. Women haven‚Äôt. At this point in time it‚Äôs more important to advocate for women and their reproductive rights seeing as in many places we don‚Äôt even have any, not to mention that people protest to take away women‚Äôs reproductive rights daily. No one does that to men. 
In short, no. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an issue.

Me:So if i understand you correctly: 
A lady can have an abortion even if the father wants it (which is fine)
But a father can not say that he wants no part in the child's life whatsoever?

Her:No that‚Äôs not what I said lol. Please re-read my message. I never even implied that. 

A mother doesn‚Äôt have to take the fathers opinion into consideration when deciding on going through with a pregnancy or not. It‚Äôs her body, it‚Äôs her choice. No other person gets a say over it. 

The father can say he doesn‚Äôt want to be part of the child‚Äôs life, and that‚Äôs fine. As long as he signs all the proper paperwork to terminate all parental rights legally // work out all legality‚Äôs of financial help with legal documents.

2020-09-08 03:24:28,My biggest concern when I was getting sexually assaulted was that I would be accused of hurting the woman who was doing it when I stopped her,"A few years ago I was at a party, sitting down and having a drink. A woman there got really drunk and climbed into my lap, wrapped her arms around me and started forcibly kissing me. It was very much unwanted. My friends at the party seemed to think it was hilarious. They were all laughing while she was doing it. I regret that I kind of laughed too because what else can you do when a drunk girl is physically climbing on you? But when I tried to push her off she held on and wouldn't go. The whole time I was thinking 'what if I push her too hard and she falls and all these people turn on me for hurting her.' 

I've only recently put this together, but it's pretty obvious there's an issue with how society sees men, when I'm being sexually assaulted and my biggest concern is that physically stopping the person doing it will make me seem like a victimizer at the same moment I'm actually a victim.

I eventually just forced her off as gently as I could and left the party. When I tried to talk about it with any of the people there they again just laughed it off and said something like 'but you liked it.' I didn't. Honestly it was pretty mild as far as that kind of thing goes but the total lack of concern for me by any of my friends at the party before or after is frustrating, to say the least.",1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ioe4f8/my_biggest_concern_when_i_was_getting_sexually/,defaultusername001

2020-09-08 16:31:39,Eminem's Rejection of Male Privilege.,"In this nanoessay, I will discuss four topics. First, I will discuss the Male Privilege itself. Second, I will discuss Eminem's personal experience of the Male Privilege. Third, I will discuss Eminem's rejection of the Male Privilege. Forth, I will discuss the possibilities of more men rejecting the Male Privilege in the future.

Male Privilege has two aspects: societal status and modern ideology. Men do have some real advantages in Modern Society, like higher pay, and much higher chance of being among the 0.1% of population forming the Elite. Elite men do experience real privilege, yet lived experience of tens of millions of ordinary men is different. For these men, everyday experience is that of discrimination. Men are discriminated in Divorce procedures and Family Courts. Male offenders are more likely to be arrested and convicted then female offenders given the same evidence. Once convicted, men on average get 63% longer penalty for the same crime. Men accused of Sexual Offenses are presumed guilty by College Tribunals and MSM. Male victims of Domestic Violence are more likely to be arrested then helped by Law Enforcement.

Another important aspect of men's status in Modern Society is the perception of men by culture and academia. Male bashing and Violence Against Men are widely acceptable in the Main Stream Media. Even though less then 1% of people hold real power, most Liberals view men as Privileged Oppressors. Many Feminist and Liberal scholars (#notallofthem) believe that all men have unforgivable guilt. The article ""Think It‚Äôs #NotAllMen? These 4 Facts Prove You‚Äôre Just Plain Wrong"" posted on ""Everyday Feminism"" website summarizes the point of view of most Liberal Social Science scholars. The article argues that all men are guilty of some form of microaggression. An example of microaggression presented in the article is a man who ""in a conversation with a woman, talks over or mansplains to her without recognizing the behavior"". Any man must know that ""You‚Äôre actually not automatically entitled to share your opinion; in fact, your opinion might be pointless or even harmful in some conversations,"" yet even a woke Liberal Feminist man can commit such microaggression. According to ""Beware the Feminist Man"" published by Harvard Crimson, ""What these male feminists fail to realize is that, as men, they will always be oppressors. No matter how many feminist marches they attend or how much feminist literature they read, they are not exempt from perpetuating the subordination of women."" Thus, according to many great minds of Academia, men can never expiate their guilt.

According to some Feminist and Liberal thinkers, men have an ethical duty to accept the worst abuse without complaining. According to ""The Problem With Twitter, as shown by the Sarah Jeong fracas"" by Ezra Klein, men should not be offended by the phrase ""kill all men"". The phrase should be understood as venting frustration. Many media articles are defending the slogan ""men are trash"". Recently I have read an interesting conversation on the Reddit group r/Askfeminists. A college men who was already depressed and almost suicidal became even more depressed since he has to share a lounge with female students who openly profess hatred for men and claim that ""we need fewer men on Earth"". Most feminists told him that he is making a big deal out of nothing and that women just need to vent their anger at Patriarchy. One of the milder answers is: ""it's important to realize that it isn't always about you, as harsh as that sounds... When you ask if you deserve these comments, unless they are directed at you, deserve has nothing to do with it."" At the same time men lose their careers over the mildest joke, men themselves are required to be Stoic and accept the worst abuse as deserved.

For tens of millions of ordinary American men, Male Privilege is an experience of endless abuse and discrimination. For them, Male Privilege is also the requirement not to protest abuse and discrimination in any way.

The Male Privilege described above has been the standard in Western Society since 2013, and has been present in milder forms since 1990s. Marshall Mathers was born in 1972, so it would seem that his youth could not have been marked by the experience of the modern version of the Male Privilege. Nevertheless, he had a very similar experience growing up. Allegedly, he was abused by his mother, and many aspects of his later life indicate that his account is true. Some of the abuse is described in his song ""Cleaning Out My Closet"": she regularly hit him, spat at his face, called him ""little $#@!"". She even wished him dead. Like Liberals who justify Hate Speech against men, almost all abusers have endless rationalizations for their actions.

By the late 1990s, many men in Academia and MSM have accepted Male Privilege in its milder 1990s version. Even though things like #killallmen and #menaretrash were two decades away, a male bashing greeting card industry already flourished. Countless books written by male authors expressed collective guilt on behalf of all men. Another approach to Male Privilege was taken by a few men and women: they used logic and facts to prove that men are not always privileged and do in fact suffer discrimination. This approach is very useful in persuading men that they are neither innately evil nor privileged. Unfortunately reason and logic do not work on those who use men as scapegoats.

Eminem had a totally different approach toward those who wanted to force any version Male Privilege upon him. His songs in general and his disc ``The Marshall Mathers LP"" (2000) in particular have the strongest possible message of noncompliance and disobedience. The first track called ``Public Service Announcement 2000"" has the following words to anyone offended by the rest of the disc: ""If you don't like it you can **** my ****ing ****"". The song expressing the most powerful anger is ""Kill You"". ""Amityville"" also contains unrepeatable lyrics about Eminem's mother and sister. Had these lyrics (which I dare not repeat) been written in an online forum, the offender would have been banned from Social Media and visited by the FBI. Had anyone used these unspeakable words in an offline conversation, they would have been treated as a dangerous lunatic. Eminem's work, however, is Art of a Genius. It takes a genius to express anger as an Art Masterpiece. According to Wikipedia, the album sold 1.78 million copies in the US in its first week and 21 million copies overall. Eminem's genius sustained the spirit of Defiance in an age when bashing and scapegoating men was almost as fashionable as now. For a decade, Eminem's art gave strength to men who refuse to be apologetic for who they are.

Over almost two decades, Eminem's anger subsided and his youthful energy disappeared. He regrets his past and attacks President Trump. In the 2017 song ""Bad Husband"" he expresses remorse for his past. Eminem2000 or Slim Shady has retired. We are grateful for his past work, but we can not expect anything new as powerful as ""The Marshall Mathers LP"". No artist can produce good art on demand.

Is there any way for modern and future men to reject the Male Privilege? Men and women who support men want to be brave, but anyone can be fired and blacklisted for the slightest objection to Misandry or Discrimination Against Men. Offline, men are forced to keep quiet. Male bashing, discrimination, and enforced silence engenders anger in many men. During the past decade, men's anger has been widely expressed on Social Media. Up to about 2016, men's groups have been growing on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. MGTOW videos are popular and number about 400,000. Now, there is a Social Media Purge of all Politically Incorrect ideas, so all of channels dealing with men's issues are on borrowed time. Do they have any future?

Not being a soothsayer, I can not predict the Future, but I may have some insights. Many nanoessays, articles, books, videos, and audios expressing men's anger will be of poor quality and not gain popularity. In many cases, unskillful and crude expression of anger produces material worthy of scoffing and derision. That is not art.

Hopefully, there will be some self made musicians who will express anger as Art. Possibly, these songs and music videos expressing men's anger will gain popularity due to the very controversy they would generate.

The co-workers A is the agressive one, he refuse to do his work (he was delivering heavy boxes and left them in the middle of the path) when I (female) asked him to do. The co-workers B come in to take he's shifts and see the mess ask A to do his work, A say no because his shift is over. B say this is not a reason to left everything, A start telling him that he do what he want, B asked him again A start shouting and and physically blocking B against a wall and putting his forehead again B's. I ask him to calm down he turn to me and start shouting at me. I tell him to go away if he don't want to work and he walk fast at me blocking me against a kitchen angle moving his hands saying he do what he want. I try to stay calm, at this point all my body was shaking, repeating, he then shout something took he's stuff and left.
As soon as he left I've called my boss (female) she told me she can't talk and she call me in 5, she didn't. At this point my shift was over and I've waited 50 minutes and the manager (female) call B and ask him what happens. Because B must be a strong male he mostly talk about how A got agressive toward me.
Anyway I left send a message to my boss telling her that I refuse to work with A again, tell her to watch to surveillance video. And she told me it was OK, he was just being a macho towards B but he shouldn't have raised he hand next to me. I'm sad to see that B can't complain and talk for himself without being belittled by others. I'm sad to see that agression must be push to extreme to be valid for men.  

Anyway my boss was in denial but she said yes, will see if it's gonna be apply.

Still it is a good example. If any UN-Level organization posted about women in this manner, be it true or untrue, they would lose the worlds respect.  
This has absolutely nothing to do with women or COVID19.  
Also it is not the direct result of feminism.

It is anything in public infected by greedy opportunism

More then this, it reminded me of what being MRA actually means.

The major issue is not feminism. It could be anything but naturally this propaganda mechanism works against people who are attracted towards logic, reasonability and actually taking responsibility, because there is no way they would follow this scam.

MRA means, we need to call out the bullies, who are riding the moral bandwagon for their egocentric mission:

* Organizations (especially the one with biggest impact on international humanitarian law)
* Corporations
* ""Democratic"" judiciary
* Educational institutions
* Entertainment industry
* Politics
* Media

2020-09-10 08:29:07,Excessive Delays in Handling Child Support Modification Requests May Be Unlawful,"A woman recently complained that her fiance's paychecks were being garnished to such an extent that they and the two year old child they share are homeless, and that the child support agency has excessively delayed a review of the child support for over a year after dad had lost his job, even though he had a good payment history for many years prior. She also suggested that the person reviewing the case appeared to be biased in favor of the other children.

I responded:

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.

Your state should have the child support formula online. Please use it to estimate.

Please note:

&gt; (2)Expedited administrative and judicial procedures (including the procedures specified in subsection (c)) for establishing paternity and for establishing, modifying, and enforcing support obligations. 

&gt; 42 U.S. Code ¬ß 666 - Requirement of statutorily prescribed procedures to improve effectiveness of child support enforcement

&gt; https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/666

This also may include:

&gt; Possible failure to ""protection of civil rights"".

&gt; 42 U.S. Code ¬ß 671 
&gt; https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/671

Including the civil rights of your child to the fair economic support of their father.

I would consider a complaint with the HHS Office of Civil Rights on the ground that your child and fiance are being deprived their civil rights to expedited administrative procedures for the the modification of child support.

&gt; HHS Office of Civil Rights 
&gt; 1-800-368-1019
&gt; https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/filing-a-complaint/index.html

I would also consider a complaint against the child support agency with the state attorney general on the grounds that they have intentionally delayed this modification request in an effort to steal from your child and to line their pockets with federal incentive funds, if I felt it were true.

Possible criminal conspiracy against rights:

&gt; ""If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same; or""

&gt; 18 U.S. Code ¬ß‚ÄØ241.Conspiracy against rights

&gt; https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241

Furthermore, such long term theft from an innocent infant amounts to a form of child abuse on the part of the officials committing that potentially criminal act.

&gt; A person who, while engaged in a professional capacity or activity described in subsection (b) of section 226 of the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 on Federal land or in a federally operated (or contracted) facility, or a covered individual as described in subsection (a)(2) of such section 226 who, learns of facts that give reason to suspect that a child has suffered an incident of child abuse, as defined in subsection (c) of that section, and fails to make a timely report as required by subsection (a) of that section, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 1 year or both.

&gt; 18 U.S. Code ¬ß‚ÄØ2258.Failure to report child abuse

&gt; https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258

Many of these are federal crimes.

If I were you I would get everything in writing and consider speaking to a lawyer. I may also consider reporting federal crimes to the FBI and reporting civil rights violations to the US Department of Justice Office of Civil Rights and the US Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights.

Anyone may report federal crimes to the FBI.

2020-09-10 12:25:18,Friend going through divorce. Am I Doing the correct thing?,"I don't know where else to go or what else to do. I need some external advice. Some background on the situation. 

My friend is getting divorced from his wife after 9 years together (dating and marriage). She ruined that man, my dearest friend. Sucked the joy from him, bit by bit. I just watched, because every time I brought it up he brushed it aside since they had 2 children together and he dreams of having that ""perfect family life"" tm. After 6 years she had an affair, which started emotionally but ended with her sleeping with the guy at a stag and doe for her own cousin beside my friend as she thought he had drank too much to wake up from the sex she was having. That turned out false and he awoke to the two of them going at it. I pushed for him to split but instead she convinced him they could try couple therapy (never did go) and she would talk to a counselor (never went either). I accepted his choice and if he chose to accept her back I would as well. I did ask questions, like did she still talk to the guy (yes), was she agreeing to their stipulations (no), did she say the affair was his fault (yes), etc etc. She became more manipulative and controlling and emotionally abusive, actively undermined him in front of the kids, and as a result he became increasing depressed, turning to self medication by drinking and smoking and developed a very short temper. Anytime he started to really get traction concerning her she would smile, put out like crazy and his stupid ass would think things were fine again. At the 8 year mark, 1.5 years ago, she walked out. Left the kids, him, everything. After a week or two she realized ""Holy shit life is hard when no one is paying for shit"" and came back to him which he agreed to and welcomed her back with open arms (she went from living with her parents at age 18/19 to moving into her husbands house with no need to work ever). Again they set up stipulations she happily ignored. This time though I wouldn't let up. I needled more and more, pointing out the abuse and such but he still ignored me. Several weeks ago a childhood friend visited him and , low and behold, he caught the two of them in bed together, in a location where the children could have seen. He lost it and tossed her ass out and now they are getting a divorce.

And that brings me here. He is constantly underestimating her and overestimating his own abilities. She knows how to play him like a fiddle. Her father and mother ran a law firm. He believes she wouldn't screw him over and at each phase she does. She wanted no lawyers involved, he agreed saying she just wanted an amicable split, and to have her buy him out of the house. We (my GF and myself) told him that was stupid and he should lawyer up, just not tell her. Consult the guy every step of the way without her knowing. He refused at first.  She would call almost daily to ask how he was doing, we told him to go almost no contact, just answer her is short simple ways and only about the kids, yet instead he told her all about his continuing medical problems (both physical and mental). She has been spreading the rumour about him being abusive. His response was to point out that she was abusive towards him and her claims wont matter because it was really her being abusive. I LITERALLY showed him how in in Canada that doesn't matter with statistics and the Duluth model still being present, even pointing out Johnny Depp. During a goaded fight with her over her rumors he dropped he had gotten a lawyer. That was friday night. Today (Tuesday after a long weekend) she dropped the kids off at his place, saying she had to work suddenly, then 4 hours later his lawyer calls saying she is going for custody and support. 

I love this man. He has been my friend for 2.5 decades. I don't make friends easily, I'm on the spectrum and I consider him as one of the most important people in my life. I was screwed by the system myself \~10 years ago. Full on psychotic break and everything. I know how the system will destroy this man who only wants his kids. He refuses all advice and help because he believes he knows best. In Canada we have Canadian Association for Equality (C.A.F.E.) and Canadian Centre for Men and Families (C.C.M.F.) and I have sent him resources from both, even trying to get him to go to the free  legal clinic they host. He isn't receptive. All I feel I can do is TWIST that knife regards to the fact that he will lose his children to motivate him to take this more seriously and use the resources available for him and accept advice from the smarter and more specialized people.

I guess I just need to know. Am I doing the correct thing? He has already mentioned suicide once (after being shown the statistics) and I don't wish to drive my closest and dearest friend to that. Yet I know him losing the kids will drive him down deep and dark roads in his mind.  I want him armed and ready with everything he could need to get his kids. Everyone in my life (minus the GF) are telling me to butt out and let him do his own thing, however all I see is him trying to do this himself and giving her more ammo. I feel if I don't do everything I can he will lose the kids because he isn't taking this serious enough, and in doing so I will lose a friend. I don't overly exaggerate when I say those kids are his life blood and I genuinely worry for his mental health in that scenario. So....I dunno....I hate feeling impotent. Obviously I'll be there regardless of the outcome but should I be pushing so hard?

Do you think ""kill all men"" will workout? Can world function without men in future? I personally think in the near future 'men' as a species will become extinct in next 100-200 years.

They hired a partner at a law firm for the complainant to try and burn me with a plea deal that would require me to withdrawal for three years and admit guilt.,"I was falsely accused by a girl with mental illness of sexual assault. Hired the best law firm in the country to protect me. Wasn‚Äôt enough. Suspended from school for a year, but making the best out of the situation.

Was recently suspended for a false accusation. I had our conversations, evidence, proof, and it still wasn‚Äôt enough. I went through 8 months of emotional hell and no one was there to protect me but myself, and fortunately my family. My college hired a partner at a law firm for the complainant to try and run me through the ground. They wanted me to withdraw for three years, and admit to guilt but I put up a fight to protect myself. I knew these allegations were horseshit. It was a long fought battle, and I eventually simultaneously won. I fought them for 8 months, hired forensic pathologists, you name it! I was not going to be a victim to the me too narrative. What happened in the end you ask? I was suspended for just a year(during a covid year with overpriced online classes so whatever), and I knew they had to suspend me. In a time like this, with the me too narrative, the school would receive far too much backlash if they had allowed the complainant to not win, so I think that‚Äôs why they removed me for a year. Regardless, I saw it as a sideways win. Rather than having to withdrawal for three years, and admit to guilt, i got a one year suspension, with no guilt admission( this was big because i didn‚Äôt do what I was being accused of, and I fought for my innocence). I am out of school for a year, and I can finally relax from the hell i was put through. I am starting to feel happier again. 

I am honestly not as mad as you think, I am more just glad this is over. This was the worst 8 months of my life. The emotional stress of being falsely accused of something I didn‚Äôt do, and the stress of potentially having your life ruined over it was killing me. I am just glad it‚Äôs over. I now have a 12 month paid internship at a bank that i am working at right now before I go back to school so I am making the best out of the situation so yeah. So as bad as it seems guys I am honestly doing okay. My future is not ruined. 

I am making this post to show that if you do not come from a bit of financial support you‚Äôre literally a scapegoat for the universities in situations like this. By hiring the best firm in the country, I got myself a year out of school, and no admission to guilt. But for some poor kid, unfortunately he would not be protected by the university, let alone have the financial means to hire someone to protect them. This post is also to show you where the universities stand with the accused. If you are accused you won‚Äôt get help. They won‚Äôt pay your legal bills. 

All in all. Lesson learned from this situation is to vet people out. No I am not going to go anti women. I am not mgtow. No I am not a misogynist. Just learn to vet people out. I took a risk to have a one night stand with someone I barely knew who ultimately had some form of mental illness. I am to blame for putting myself in that position, so take it from me and be careful out there and really learn about the person before getting in bed with them.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iq29jg/i_was_falsely_accused_of_sexual_assault_my_school/,CYKAblyaddd

Disclaimer: I live in India, so the dynamics or situations described here may not resonate with those who are not familiar with Indian society. Also, I know, not everyone will believe the incidents, and it's OK, but please don't be rude or dismissive. 

It's a long story. But, here goes...

**The backstory**:

Around three years ago, a woman from my then-boyfriend-now-fianc√©'s apartment building and her mother started threatening him saying if he crosses paths with her they will call the police. The woman's exact words were - ""I am a lawyer and I will do what is required, if you cross paths with me again"". He had done nothing wrong. The actual issue was they were walking their dog around the same time that my fianc√© and me would feed a couple of stray dogs outside the building. That would make them really difficult to control their huge German Shepherd (they were two really feeble looking ladies). My fianc√©'s mom asked them repeatedly, 'did he say anything to you?', 'did he do anything?'. They kept saying, 'no, but we don't want them crossing paths with her'.

We tried a lot to reason with them, but they wouldn't listen at all. They maintained that he was ""stalking"" her. We talked to a few neighbours, and we decided not to pay much heed to them. Also, there was only one entrance to the building, so there is no way not to cross paths with them. 

A few months went by, and they saw us going about our usual lives. We behaved like we didn't even know them. Then they started recording me and my fianc√© EVERY evening. When we left the building, they would be downstairs with their phone ready. When we came back, still, they would have their phone ready and recording.

At first, I thought, forget it. How long will they record us? And what is that going to do anyway? They will stop at some point. Then my fianc√© started calling me sometimes in the morning, when I wasn't  with him, saying they come down and wait there even in the morning, at the time that he left the building, and were recording him. And he started feeling extremely harassed. We even looked at the CCTV footage of the building, and what we saw was, they knew his timings and they would come down prepared to record him. We collected the CCTV footage as evidence.

For the longest time, I maintained that, let's just ignore it. But, the video recording went on for A WHOLE YEAR. I started feeling really horrible for my fianc√© and we decided that we should go to the police. Before going to the police, we had appealed to the building secretary multiple times, the secretary (also a woman) kept saying, she will talk to them and there is no need to get the police involved. But she never did. We decided one last time we should talk to the secretary, and we told her, that either you do something or we are going to the police. That was a mistake.

She went and told the women, that, we know you are recording him without his consent, and it would be better if you stop doing that, or else they will call the police on you. The woman told her ""I am a lawyer, and I know the law better"" and basically asked her to f\*ck off.

That very night, at around 10PM, they went to the police station. The woman cried to the policewoman in the women's cell of the police station. Being a lawyer, she specifically made a complained with those gender biased sections of the Indian Penal Code which require that the police arrest the man immediately (section 354a/b - sexual harassment). She lied about a lot of things. She said my fianc√© tried to run her over, manhandled her etc. None of which was true. (Later we found out that, right before she went to the police, she went to her neighbour asking him to accompany them to the police station. When asked whether he ever touched or abused her, she said **no**. Just that she ""feels"" threatened. This was revealed by her neighbour to us later.)

What followed was very traumatic for me. The police barged into the apartment and took him. As honest, simple, middle class people, we had never seen the inside of the police station. Me and his parents had to follow him to the police station, ask/plead the policewoman to let him go, that none of it is true. She refused. They took him to a jail. Next morning me along with his parents had to go to the court, get bail. Then hire a lawyer, explain everything to him. This was all unchartered territory for us.

Within two days of that night, the women left their apartment and moved somewhere else.

The police quickly realised that there was no case to build. I narrated everything to them, even showed them all the CCTV footage we had saved. They never came to the building to investigate, or look at the CCTV. They told me and my fianc√© if we just apologised, they would take the case back. But we did not, because we did nothing wrong. They never filed the chargesheet. The case will most likely be closed just like that.

A few months just went by. I was still in a state of shock, and felt helpless. I felt like I didn't have closure. So I google her name. To my shock, she is a ""gender equality activist"" who is also a ""mental illness survivor"" and had been ""very close to committing suicide"". She wrote long twitter threads of how the ""stalker"" made her feel like committing suicide and how she almost didn't make it to 2020. How she will ""fight for justice"" and ""put him behind bars"". She did an online interview with someone, and she narrated her lies, yet again. Someone asked her in that instagram live to give her the ""stalker""'s address, and he will kill him. To which she heartily laughed and said, she will keep that in mind.

**I need help:**

After I saw her social media posts, I got obsessed. I looked at her Twitter, Instagram handles, her blog multiple times a day. And every time she wrote something about my fianc√©, or ""the narrative"" that she chooses to put out there, I just broke down, because it was all lies, and still she was getting support from feminists telling her ""she was strong"". My fianc√© and his family kept telling me not to look at her profiles, to forget it. The case will be closed anyway. She is permanently gone from our lives. But I just don't feel closure. I took their advice and haven't seen what crap she has written for the last one month, but I still feel the urge to look. How can I move on? I want to forget her, and the incident. I want to move on, enjoy life with my partner. But in the back of my mind, I feel like what other vile stuff must she be writing about my dearest partner.

But every time, on TV or someplace I hear the words ""arrest"", ""sexual harassment"", ""bail"", I get horrible flashbacks. I want justice, but I know I won't get it in the court of law. Everytime I hear the word ""stalker"", my heart breaks all over again. I can't imagine what my fianc√© must have gone through, but he is holding strong.

**My advice to men, in general**:

If a woman is harassing you, just go to the police. Collect evidence of the harassment. Forget that it's a woman. Think that it's another human harassing you. Do what's required to protect yourselves.

**TL;DR** A woman filed a false case of sexual harassment against my fianc√© a year ago, and I am still traumatised. How do I get over it.

2020-09-11 11:24:53,"How Feminism silences men, and what to do about it"," 

The American far-left has been taken over by Social Justice Warriors (SJWs) and Feminists advocating extreme positions. Among these positions are that only men can be sexist, only whites can be racist, women are always and only the victims of oppression, men are always and only the benefactors of oppression, and if there is ever a situation where a man is discriminated against it is just a consequence of his overwhelming privilege backfiring on him. The people holding these positions can be extremely difficult to converse with. In many cases merely asking why they believe what they are asserting is taken to prove that you are a bigot. These SJWs seem willing to, indeed some seem to delight in, destroying the lives of anyone who disagrees with them or fails to live up to their moral code.

&amp;#x200B;

I knew all this but didn't really understand it. I didn't understand how it worked, how they seized and maintained power, what their aims were, or how any of the machinery of this political movement worked until I read the book ""Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity‚Äïand Why This Harms Everybody "". I know not everyone can read a book at the drop of a hat, so I abridged the most salient ideas down to \~25 pages.

&amp;#x200B;

I know that's a considerable wall of text, but the understanding I gained from this experience has huge ramifications in how we pursue the cause of Egalitarianism in our culture, given the destructive aims of both the far left and the far right. If you can spare even 5 minutes, at least review the premise section, and peruse the table of contents.

I accept only biological genders male, female, transmale and transfemale. I got riled up by the gender pronoun laws of Canada and other social media like twitter banning people for mis-gendering (zir and what not).

Since this gender spectrum is a outcome of male bashing ideology(feminism), I stand to rebel‚úä. Also claiming perks on superfluous grounds of unique gender is petty, i.e., non confront gender neutral trans female with their own pronounsü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. At the same time renaming males as cis-male, which male gender never agreed upon. I didn't ask for it. It was forced upon meüò°. 

My proposal:
To Bring back equal playing grounds I propose the new gender Super Male. According to feminist own belief of ""gender is fluid"" , people can identify by their own gender their choice. 


I identify as Super Male 
Super Male is a new respectable way off calling  Cis gender male. Please join in guys and identify yourself as Super Male where ever possible. 

Pronoun that shall be used to refer Super Male (lord thyselfüòÅ) are

""mi'lord"" for he, ""mi'lord"" for him, ""mi'lords"" for his, ""lord thyself"" for himself

Examples of usage:

2020-09-12 00:11:48,Question/theory?,"Do you think that the reason men tend to be less afraid and hesitant to go for late night walks  compared to women is not because of privilege but rather the ideology that‚Äôs often instilled into boys that they should be at the forefront of danger(if that makes sense) and they shouldn‚Äôt feel fear due to the fact that they‚Äôre male? 

See, I‚Äôm not sure if I phrased the question right but I‚Äôve just been thinking about it. Like when I was scared of something, my parents would often comfort me but when my brothers were scared they‚Äôd say something along the lines of ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a boy, you can‚Äôt be scared.‚Äù or ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt be a yellow dog.‚Äù 
So if you consider the possibility that a lot of men are told this from a young age, then could you actually call it male privilege or is it just suppressing fear due to being told that it‚Äôs not okay for you to feel that way for a long time? Like, women, most of the time, tend to be more protected than men, so obviously when they walk alone, they‚Äôre gonna feel a sense of insecurity and of course if they had a past case of an assault they‚Äôre gonna be even more fearful but I‚Äôve seen cases where men have been assaulted both sexually and physically and whilst they tend to have a bit more edge, they still do late night walks. So I‚Äôm thinking maybe it‚Äôs because of like the mindset of ‚Äúnot being a coward‚Äù we instill in our young men. Im probably repeating myself at this point but,basically men probably still feel this fear and anxiety about walking late at night too but it‚Äôs probably pushed back due to the things they were told as kids. I don‚Äôt really know a lot and all of this could be wrong so I just want to hear what other people think. 

I can‚Äôt really focus on a particular thought right now so I‚Äôm sorry if you have a stroke reading this since it‚Äôs so horribly written but I just wanted to know because it crossed my mind. Also sorry if this post doesn‚Äôt belong here, I really didn‚Äôt know where to ask this and I‚Äôm most familiar with this subreddit so, yeah.",1.0,1.0,0.99,8.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iqtiwy/questiontheory/,Yeet_Chu
2020-09-12 00:20:46,"Thank you, MRAs","I was told that MRAs are terrible people, specifically, that they're ""misogynists"" and ""rape apologists.""  I guess they assumed I would take their word for it and not check it out for myself.  I did so.  Turns out, their claims were just ridiculous straw men.  What I found instead were men, many of whom were fathers who wanted to be involved in their children's lives.  They wanted to be good fathers.  Men get blamed a lot for being absentee fathers, and I'm sure some men are guilty of that, but I also believe that any father who makes an effort to be present and good to his kids should be congratulated.  I would therefore like to thank all MRA fathers here.  

I also found men who are concerned about the high level of men committing suicide.  This concern, of course, does not mean that men want women to kill themselves, but when 78 to 80% of suicides are men, it makes me suspect that something about life as a man makes us more prone to suicide.  I believe men being compassionate toward other men is a good thing.  MRAs have shown this compassion when so many others have apathy.  I believe this is a good quality to be celebrated.  No one deserves to be branded a misogynist for caring about the lives of other men.  

There's more.  I could write an entire book on this subject, but suffice it to say, I figured out that I was lied to.  MRAs keep getting bashed unjustly.  That's why I wanted to buck that trend and thank you all for the hard and unappreciated work you've done on behalf of good men.",1.0,1.0,1.0,70.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iqtpex/thank_you_mras/,TigPlaze

He was more of a follower than a decision maker. A loner, than a leader. My mother and my father always clashed. Once they divorced, my father found a woman that shook money in his face. She was pretty loaded in the beginning and though she was mentally unstable, he married her. He quickly found out she was very jealous and would verbally attack him for every small thing. 
   He felt it wouldn‚Äôt escalate to more than that, so he kind of just blew it off. He put up with so much. After a few years of marriage she began to beat him. She had bruised his ribs, kicked his nuts multiple times and threatened to do more. By then she was pregnant so he felt that he couldn‚Äôt leave her, for the child‚Äôs sake. It‚Äôs been over a decade now, maybe even two, thinking about how old my half sister is now.

2020-09-12 04:05:55,I think partners should try their best to stay in good health for eachother (this includes physical fitness),"I don't want to come across as shallow at all. In fact, I used to be obese at nearly 200 pounds. Am average height and female so 200 pounds looks very unhealthy on me. I'm in my late 20's. Through high school and my first round of college, I was obese and had a host of health issues. Not to mention, I was severely depressed. Additionally, I made all these excuses for my weight (thyroid, birth control, carbs, etc). I was also constantly rejected, and back then I blamed everyone but myself. It took a real eye opener to notice the reality of my problem, especially as my health issues got worse and I had no energy to do anything.

Fast forward to a couple years later and I got rid of the excuses and ended up losing over 70 pounds basically eating whatever I want while closely monitoring calories with an app. Not only did my health improve but so did my confidence and my energy. Fast forward to today and I've still kept the weight off on average, excluding holidays and vacations where I temporarily put a bit back on but comes off fairly quickly. I'm also dating a guy (late 30's) who used to be obese as well, before we met, and lost over 50 pounds. He generally follows keto.

After vacation or holidays, my boyfriend will point out to me if it looks like I've gained weight or if I've gained size. SO many women (all who are clearly overweight) have told me to dump his a$$, calls him a jerk, abusive, etc. All I do is chuckle. There's NOTHING wrong with what he does. In fact, I do the same exact thing if he starts putting on weight. It's not abuse. It's motivating, being honest, and basically keeping eachother in check. Back when he was obese, he apparently had the same issues (bad health, depressed, low energy).

If we were both obese again, we wouldn't have the energy to go out on dates together, our money would go to hospital bills instead of vacations, if we had kids together we would already be too exhausted to take care of them. One of us could possibly die of health complications related to body weight. Our sex drives could be affected. List goes on. And I'll be honest, we might even lose some attraction to eachother. It wouldn't be the end-all be-all, especially since we're attracted to eachothers personalities at this point more but we still both believe physical attraction is important to an extent.

Yet so many people (mainly overweight) don't seem to understand. And I see this more from other women than men. They think my boyfriend is a bad person. They complain about their health problems or not able to get a date. Some of the married ones (overweight) who have spouses in good shape and health complain and refuse to take any responsibility if their marriage starts having issues. I personally believe that both partners should put in the effort to stay in good health and shape for eachother. Not doing so can cause issues down the line, whether directly or indirectly.",1.0,1.0,0.99,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iqy6bj/i_think_partners_should_try_their_best_to_stay_in/,Fat2Fit91

2020-09-12 04:23:16,The hypocrisy of #BalanceTonPorc displayed in Belgium,"If this has no place here, let me know and delete it.  

A days ago a trend started in France "" Balance Ton rapper "" started poping out with female exposing french male rap singers on social media.  
Two days ago, ""Rom√©o Elvis"" was the latest personne being exposed in a series of tweet.  
A female published screenshots of private DMs between her and the singer in which he appologied for what can be described as inappropriate behaviour. He says sorry, says that he told everything to his girlfriend and let the girl kno that she can tell t to the media if she wishes to do so. So, obviously, she annonymously published it all on twitter.  

The plot twist in all of that is that Rom√©o Elvis's sister, Ang√®le, another Belgian singer and vocal feminist, had, a few months ago, released a VERY popular song called "" [Balance to Quoi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hi7Rx3En7-k) "" (balance ton what) in which she was very vocal and supportive of the metoo movement.  

When the accusations againt her brother were made, she stayed silent before her PR team released a neutral statement. In between, people flooded her social medias with "" Balance ton fr√®re "" ( Denounce your brother ).  

Of course, all the medias and the feminists didn't understand that people were posting comments attacking her activist position that suddenly became a silent position (and you know that silence = being complicite ) and not her personnaly.  
People's point of veiw was ""you encourage others to denounce predators, now that your brother is directly accused, you stay silent"".  
Of course, medias and activists took it as a personnal attack on her as a female artist to paint her as a victim of cyber-harassement from the patriarchy and toxic males...  

The moral of the story, in my opinion is that she positioned herself as an activist, being very suportive of the movement but, once someone close to her was the target, she understood how it can turn into a whitch hunt and how things are overblown on social medias. And when her brother was the target, suddenly, metoo wasn't so fun anymore...

2020-09-12 05:21:52,Can we discuss adding mandatory paternity testing to standard birth workups?,"In the US, paternity fraud laws are rare.

While the biggest issues that can come from a paternity test being asked are hurt feelings, I feel during normal post birth workup that it would result in too many positives.

Tennessee has passed paternity fraud laws along with a civic suit to be followed up to recoup expenses.

Georgia requires a mandated paternity test for child support.

The general argument of ‚Äútrust‚Äù, or ‚Äúdid the crime now pay‚Äù seems a moot point, anybody can lie, and years or decades can pass.

Many people that separate and end up paying child support make serious sacrifices at times too.

How is it that a woman can literally say your the father, bind it on a legal document, and there is a statute of limitations on paternity testing, all based on someone‚Äôs word before the subject may come up?",1.0,1.0,1.0,74.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iqzl6d/can_we_discuss_adding_mandatory_paternity_testing/,Trashrat2019

Good to see a book that highlight the disadvantages men face currently and in the past and offering a critical alternative to the patriarchy theory is best selling in Spain.

The book also explain how men's issues are dissmised as the author say "" Limiting male problems to purely internal issues based on gender roles. Males suffer social pressures to prevent expressing their feelings and they are constrained by their role as providers and protectors, but all they have to do to solve their problems is to change their attitude, learn how to communicate better and ask for help. This approach is present, for example, in the subject of suicide. The discussion of female suicide tends to be focus on external factors: the living conditions of women, the stress they endure, etc. When talking about male suicide, on the other hand, the main focus is on internal factors: men don‚Äôt cry, they have to be tough, they can‚Äôt ask for help, etc. Why is it not possible to conceive that perhaps men commit suicide at higher rates because they have harsh and stressful living conditions that turn their lives into hell?

2020-09-12 23:29:10,The way I was treated by a female medic before I went in for surgery.,"I had an accident and I was taken to the ER. The medics were mostly male. They were all extremely nice. They know that you are frightened and in a lot of pain. One of them told me ' we're coming with the morphine in a second'. They injected it and it felt better.

I was later scheduled for surgery. If anyone has underwent surgery they know how stressful it is. From what I have seen on USA TV, they normally give patients pre op sedatives to relax you. They do not do that here.

During pre-op I had a foreign female anesthesiologist who was double checking with me whether I was allergic to anything. I noticed that on my right there was a male nurse who was sticking needles in my arms and I started speaking to him in my native language. He made light of the situation and he made me feel better.

Suddenly the woman foreign anesthesiologist snapped at me: Stop being rude and speak in a language I understand. The last thing you have on your mind when you know that you are going to be cut open are the subtleties of social etiquette.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MensRights/comments/irelxv/the_way_i_was_treated_by_a_female_medic_before_i/,zogins
2020-09-12 23:39:07,A question for mens rights on woman and mens reproductive rights.,"So now please don‚Äôt take this the wrong way as I am against abortion but I feel that this law should be made just because females have the right. Now as you all know a female can abort a child without the fathers permission and I guess that they are the ones who have to keep the child so they should be allowed to do that but men should have the option to give the woman enough money for a abortion/healthcare cost and if they do that they should not have to pay child support as if the woman wants the child she can keep it but because the man has given her the money to abort the kid, he is no longer responsible for what happen. 

Ideas? Thoughts?

TL:DR if woman can abort a kid without the mans consent, then a men can give the woman  enough money to cover abortion/healthcare cost instead of paying child support, the woman then chooses to abort or not.",1.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ires9j/a_question_for_mens_rights_on_woman_and_mens/,freedom2b2t

2020-09-13 01:55:57,Update on my previous post: (I was falsely accused of sexual assault...,"Hey guys 

Original post here. https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/iq2day/i_was_falsely_accused_of_sexual_assault_my/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf


Just wanted to say thanks for the support. It was a very difficult 8 months. I‚Äôm happier now and I‚Äôm doing well. I will be going back next fall so I‚Äôm just making the best out of the situation. I just wanted to respond to this as everyone asked why I‚Äôm not suing the complainant for defamation or slander. You can‚Äôt sue someone for slander or defamation until you have solid proof that what they‚Äôre saying is wrong and that they had intent to maliciously hurt your reputation or well being. So that won‚Äôt really work well in sexual assault cases. My lawyer also said that opening up a civil suit as collateral against a complainant accusing you of sexual assault is very dumb because the complainant will open up a criminal trial against you to prove that you did sexually assault them. The cost/benefit analysis doesn‚Äôt justify a civil suit in sexual assault cases. 

Another thing I wanted to answer is why I deleted the post. I did not want to get identified by my school. 

Just wanted to thank everyone for the support I‚Äôve gotten. I was also very surprised to see some unbiased, and neutral responses in this group so that‚Äôs good. The goal of men‚Äôs rights is to address the issues surrounding men without being misogynistic so I was very happy to see that. 

If you have any questions about being accused, the process, or advice about how to hire a good lawyer pm me and I‚Äôll be happy to help.",1.0,46.0,0.98,9.0,/r/MensRights/comments/irha7q/update_on_my_previous_post_i_was_falsely_accused/,CYKAblyaddd

2020-09-13 07:17:52,"As a man, I'm often shamed for asking women to wear masks.","So I read [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/iqrzij/repair_men_wont_wear_masks_and_i_am_going_to_make/) about the woman asking the repair men to wear masks, and I agree. I always wear a mask around others, and I find it selfish not to because it could spread a virus that could kill myself or others. I will sometimes ask people to wear a mask if we are in close proximity, except I've noticed something- it seems I'm not allowed to ask this of women.

Whenever I remind a woman to wear a mask, the majority of the time I receive a hostile/negative reaction, and often times not even from the woman herself, but by bystanders! Recent example:

-At a sandwich shop, small space. The woman in front of me didn't have a mask. I asked her if she wouldn't mind putting one on because we are in an enclosed space. She did, but I noticed the two male cashiers (and no, it's not always men who do this) seemed to look at me funny. When it was my turn in line hey seemed a little cold towards me, and one of them said ""Did you have to talk to her like that?"" Well...no, I suppose, but I'm living with two older parents right now (thanks lockdown/unemployment...) and I'd rather not get them sick- and one of them is a woman! Why on earth was it wrong for me to say that? If a woman infects me, I might infect other women, so it really makes no sense.

Sometimes people don't say anything, but I can see disapproving looks, like I get a ""sense"" people don't like seeing a man say that to a woman, and I really don't get way, and I don't think it's fair at all. What difference does being a woman make? Statistically I have double the mortality rate, and I feel I have every right to say it.

Some people might say ""oh, but it's because you wouldn't say that to a man."" 

1. Except I say it to men too.

2. How can they make that assumption?

I've noticed women and men and roughly equally as good/bad at mask wearing, and putting on one when I ask. But the reactions- usually from others- make no sense to me.",1.0,2.0,0.56,11.0,/r/MensRights/comments/irn0kx/as_a_man_im_often_shamed_for_asking_women_to_wear/,WinterBlast9000

2020-09-13 10:08:56,How feminism negatively impacts men on and individual level.,"Most everyone in this sub seems to be well informed on how men‚Äôs problems are ignored or shunned in society so I would like to do something a bit different and share how feminism in society has negatively impacted me on an individual level. 

Dating:

I made the mistake of dating a rather hardcore feminist which I never do again. She was emotionally neglectful to the point where it caused me an inordinate amount of mental anguish. I lost far too much sleep over this girl who didn‚Äôt show that she cared. I stayed with her for so long because we had plenty of good times together and she never seemed like she had any prejudice against men. However, even through my anxiety and depression I made sure to always be there for her even at my own expense (please never do this) and yet whenever I was having trouble and needed her to be there for me she was too busy and couldn‚Äôt find the time to help me. She was unemployed and living with her parents at the time and I could tell most of the time it was just a lame excuse so that she didn‚Äôt have to put any effort into the relationship. I‚Äôm willing to accept that maybe she just wasn‚Äôt into me but that is no excuse for exploiting me for my time and emotional support. This relates to men‚Äôs rights in that the way that society views men creates an environment for men to be exploited for their time and labor. I have seen this countless times and it is due in large part to the messages that the modern feminist movement spreads. Often I hear feminists say ‚Äúall men are trash‚Äù and men and women‚Äôs problems could all be solved if there wasn‚Äôt ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù. Men are seen as inherently problematic for society and if you see men as a problem then of course you are going to treat them as such. For some perspective most of the people I associate with are between 19-24.

Social Life:

I‚Äôve noticed that throughout the years it is very rare for my problems (depression, severe anxiety, stress of dropping out of college and what I want to do with my life etc.) to be taken seriously while the women in my life can be having a bad day and everyone goes out of their way to comfort them. I think that‚Äôs amazing and we should care about each other yet only the women I know get this kind of treatment. I have countless examples of the negative treatment of men but I‚Äôll only share two. The first seemingly innocuous example is a memory I have of a girl bombing her presentation in school and leaving the classroom crying. Everyone was concerned and a few girls left class to see if she was okay. Now imagine a guy doing this. I am certain the treatment would not be opposite because after bombing one of my presentations I remember being laughed at after someone said ‚Äúhe looks like he‚Äôs going to cry‚Äù. On the surface it seems just like oh so men can‚Äôt cry after a presentation but whoop, but this is a microcosm of how men‚Äôs emotions are often treated. 

The next scenario is of me sharing my own mental troubles with my friends. I remember about 6-7 of us sitting around chatting late at night and it got onto us sharing our emotions and such and one girl talked about her depression and how she feels and all she got was support and love. A few others shared their experiences and what their emotions and mind is like. After this I had built up enough courage to share for the first time my depression and how it impacted me (insomnia, not trying in school, etc.) I got nothing in terms support. There was just this painful silence and I remember one girl saying ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not normal‚Äù that stung. And that‚Äôs all that was said about my depression, everyone just moved on after that, no support nothing from the people who I thought were my friends. (Luckily since then I‚Äôve been able to find two true friends who are always there for me and genuinely care about me.) I am willing to admit that in this scenario their actions may not be due to feminism but it is notable that all of the people there were self labeled feminists and firmly believe in the patriarchy and male privilege and I have noticed them talking negatively about men in the past, so who knows.

Not feeling cared for had led me to look further outward for support but there was nobody there either. There are very few if any politicians and public figures speaking on the problems of men in society. After this foolish outward seeking journey I came to realize that I can‚Äôt alone change how society views me, I can only change how I let it impact me. I encourage every man to focus their efforts inward and make peace with themselves before attempting to change the way society views them because the sad truth is that it‚Äôs an uphill battle we‚Äôre facing and one that we may not win. 

Conclusion/TLDR:

Men are not seen as having inherent value as human beings but rather for what they can provide for society. This is the biggest problem facing men today as it allows discrimination against men to be accepted. Currently one way we see this is the way that society treats men‚Äôs mental health and their individual problems. Lastly I would like to say that this post sounds just like complaining and self victimization but these are cherry picked examples from my life and looking at the full picture I don‚Äôt blame feminism for my problems and these types of examples have taught me not to rely on my feminism friends for any kind of support.

2020-09-13 14:48:40,"""(Insert Negative Adjective Here) Masculinity""","I'm pretty fucking sick and tired of hearing about ""toxic"" and ""fragile"" masculinity, among other adjectives. At first I thought it made sense from a grammatical perspective to say that (eg. ""toxic"" noun), however this isn't the case at all and new wave feminists and other misandry promoters don't seem to understand the idea of masculinity at all.

Masculinity is an abstract concept. From a purely psychological perspective, it can only be defined as either strong or weak (eg. someone with a strong masculine complex would be more assertive, risk-taking, bold, and so on, whereas someone with a weak masculine complex would be the opposite). You cannot put a label on masculinity other than defining where someone is on the spectrum. You would not say someone is ""toxicly autistic"" for being towards the end of their spectrum, for example.

Putting a negative adjective in combination with the word masculinity causes people to associate masculinity with bad traits which aren't masculine or feminine, such as hyper-aggressiveness, violent tendencies, insecurity, etc. whether they want to or not. It in turn causes true masculine traits to also start to be shamed, as things begin to overlap (such as taking action to defend someone overlapping with violence). Masculinity isn't just something people can stick an adjective to because it's a completely abstract concept not some mere weak thing.

80% of people surveyed found the term toxic masculinity insulting, probably harmful to boys, and unlikely to help men‚Äôs behaviour
https://zenodo.org/record/3871217

feminists were right: words matter. Just like we moved away from policeman, salesman, chairman to stop signaling to girls that these jobs are not for them we should be careful of the language we use when talking about ideas as to not signal to men that their identity as men is toxic.

Or in other words:

If your first response to someone learning about the name of your position is ""No, you're not understanding the name correctly"" ... then maybe you should rename it.

labeling a problem you see as ""toxic masculinity"" when it is a problem originating from men and women is inherently going to isolate men. If the problem was called ""toxic feminine need"" due to the expectation of women about masculine actions, women would likely react negatively just because of the terminology.

And given that many actually use toxic masculinity to mean that men are toxic, and many men feel insulted by the use of toxic masculinity, how about we keep the general idea and concepts, but instead relabel it toxic male gender roles, so it's the expectations we place on men that are toxic, instead of masculinity itself?

The vast majority of people don't think that there are multiple different varieties of masculinity, Or that masculinity is simply the roles placed on men by society. They simply think that masculinity is that which makes a man a man, and if toxic masculinity is a thing, it means that that which makes a man a man is toxic.

Instead of doubling down on using a word that people don't understand and feel offended by, as though using the ""correct terminology"" is more important than actually addressing the problem, why don't we just change how we call it, so we can stop antagonizing men and get down to actually dealing with the issues, rather than fighting about how we call it and alienating men in the process?

it is for this reason that I have stickied a post in /r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates  in the hopes of coming together in creating a more widespread survey on public perceptions of the term. (Since apparently the sample size in the first survey is insufficient to people.)

if people here would like to contribute. I'm currently trying to figure out things like 

What questions we should ask.

how to word the questions. 

How can we make the survey widespread.


EDIT: Feel free to save this and reuse it or chunks of it when you see people using the term elsewhere. 

Be polite. And spread the message that we should make an effort not to use hateful terms. (I say ""we"" specifically because it changes it from a disagreement to a community effort. Making it more persuasive.)

And if advocating for that that breaks some rule please let me know so I can remove this edit.",1.0,1410.0,0.86,455.0,/r/MensRights/comments/irvbg0/toxic_masculinity_is_thinly_veiled_misandry_and/,Forgetaboutthelonely

https://towardsagentlerworld.tumblr.com/post/106632073864/that-scott-aaronson-thing
A lot of younger men are utterly terrified of expressing any kind of interest in women.

They've been told through a number of avenues that their desire is unwanted and predatory. And so when they try to date and seek out romance. The only tool they have is being platonically nice and hoping the girl they're pining for will take the lead.

When this so obviously fails. They're often labelled as creeps and predators. And that kind of abuse leaves them feeling hurt and lied to.

So they go looking around online. But unfortunately the dating advice that exists from feminist sources just reiterates the same shit. ""be nice"" ""consume more art made by women""

That advice on it's own is utterly useless.

Now. Luckily with recent internet culture. The concept of ""simping"" has become derided.

Defined by urbandictionary as

‚Ä¢A man that puts himself in a subservient/submissive position under women in hopes of winning them over, without the woman bringing anything to the table.

‚Ä¢A man that puts too much value on a woman for no reason .

‚Ä¢A man that prides himself with ""Chivalry"" in hopes of getting sexual gratification from women .

‚Ä¢A square with no game other than ‚ÄúRolling out the Red-Carpet‚Äù for every woman.

Young men are waking up to the notion that The ""nice guy strategy"" is ineffective.

Then I started making friends with feminists and they wielded it as a club to hurt me.

It was shortly after those friendships started going to shit that I started questioning feminism and diving more into men's rights. I'm not sure that I would apply the label of MRA or masculist to myself, but I've definitely rejected the religion of feminism, as it doesn't seem to align with legitimately egalitarian values.

Or in short: when women do worse than men it's because of sexism, patriarchy, toxic masculinity and so on. If men do worse it's because women are better.

2020-09-14 09:27:59,"Why our societal conception of ""nudity=&gt;sex"" is a big problem","When sexuality is related to nudity, the starting point is to have sex and therefore it leads to get naked. But in our society, it the opposite. Nudity is related to sexuality which means getting naked will lead to have sex. The huge difference is in the first case, everyone could be naked all the time whithout problem (like the naturist does) and in the second case, you have... The fear of sexual abuse every time a man get naked in front of people since nudity lead to sex and because men are sexual predators, it will not necessarily be consensual sex... -sight-

With this conclusion in mind, let's dig into the many problems this premise create.

As a general rule, men are expected to make the first step in romantic relationship. And one of the obstacle to overcome is : ""How do I distinguish an woman looking for a relationship from the one  whose boyfriend will kick my teeth out if I try anything ?"" One of this indicator is clothing. Since in our society, nudity is linked to sexuality, the more you show your skin so ""get naked"", the more you signify your interest in sexual intercourse.

The thing is, now, a lot of women dress sexy just because they like it. Which I can totally understand and I absolutly not condemn. But in our society, it appears to be a sign of being available to seduction attempts and then can bring an unwanted attention on a woman from some men.

I think this link between sexual desire and showed skin is the reason behind dress code. Whether you just want to keep people of having sex (religions are the great specialists in this case) or you just want to avoid potential agressions (I'm looking at you feminism), a dress code can seem to be a good solution since it cut the ""I'm interested"" signal at its base.

However, it seems few people understand the purpose of a dress code. Almost every one can tell if an outfit is appropriate or not but they can't tell the reason why they think that. And because of that, it is easy to turn something like a dress code as a tool for the patriarchy to oppress women when it means to set boundaries because of our societal conception ""nudity=&gt;sex"". Understanding that would be a key in making the cause of everyone advance since rather than complaining about the patriarchy, you could actually try to make our society evolve by replacing ""nudity=&gt;sex"" by ""sex=&gt;nudity"".

DISCLAIMER : I personnally don't think that nudity necessarily lead to sexuality. This post is merely my take on one aspect of our society and I will be glad to read any criticism and counterpoint you may have.

2020-09-14 15:03:04,fathers are inferior to Mothers,"why fathers are inferior to Mothers

fathers are inferior to Mothers

Fathers aren‚Äôt needed in a child‚Äôs life

A dad could never do what a mom does or love like a mother can. They aren‚Äôt naturally capable of unconditional love. That‚Äôs why men are violent and not nurturing like women are. They don‚Äôt go through emotional and physical the process of birth. They don‚Äôt understand and go through the hormonal change. They are useless in a child‚Äôs life. There‚Äôs nothing a father can do for a child that a mother can‚Äôt do ten times better. Fathers are inferior to mothers. It‚Äôs also easier for a father to just walk out and away from their family and start or find a new one, unlike a mother. Fathers are useless and they‚Äôre not necessary to raise a child.

In the animal kingdom, mother is always by the child‚Äôs side. Fathers leave the mother and child. It‚Äôs science and nature. 
Edit: Clearly there are a ton of bad fathers trying to convince themselves otherwise and fatherless children here that can‚Äôt think for themselves. It‚Äôs sad really. Fathers are useless.

Edit: Mother grow, go through psychological, physical, and emotions connections and changes that a man could never. Naturally forever connecting her with the child. A stronger bond that a man could ever create with a child or experience. In nature, the mother is always the protector and care taker of the young. In some species it differs, yes. But primarily, it is the mother. A father could never go through the very beginning of life with a child. Or feel a kick or heartbeat inside of them. Therefore making fathers inferior. They cannot comprehend or create the love a mother feels for a child simply because they can‚Äôt experience or create it themselves. They also cannot mourn the loss of a child.  They shouldn‚Äôt be given full custody of children. They should only be allowed supervised visits.

2020-09-14 18:04:51,Disparity in Police handling of domestic violence.,"I would like to preface my post with a little background: 15 years ago I was a Child Protection Officer for Social Services here in the UK. Part of my case load were domestic violence cases (referred to DV hereafter); where the woman is either a mother, or pregnant, and dating a man who has been reported to the Police for physically abusing her.

I'd turn up with an assessment to complete, and advise the woman that if she did not leave her partner, then a Section 47 Child Protection Enquiry would be initiated under the 1989 Children Act, which means that her children will be removed to protect them from witnessing DV.

In every single case that I worked over the 3 years I was in the job, I never had a woman agree to leave her partner. Even with the threat of taking their children away, they always refused to leave the man, saying they loved him.

Preface over. One case in particular demonstrated to me that the Police have a bias when it comes to DV cases. For reasons of legality, I shall refer to the woman as Miss A, and the man as Mr B. The Police made a referral to my department, saying that they had been called out to the family home, after Miss A reported that Mr B had physically assaulted her. He was arrested, and then released and she took him back.

I called the Police before attending the property, as was standard procedure, for more background information. The Police woman advised me of his arrest for assault. I asked if there was a history of violence from Miss A. The Police woman said that she had prior arrests and convictions, but refused to state what they were, as they were ""not relevant to the case"". The reason I would ask this question, was for my own protection, in case the mother or her partner's would be a danger to myself and my attending colleague.

I attended the property, and went through the assessment with Miss A. I advised her that if she refused to leave Mr B, then a S47 CP Enquiry would be initiated, and her child would be placed into the care system during the investigation. She refused to leave him, just as I had expected.

I then asked if her child could instead stay with the grandmother. At that moment Miss A then exploded in a rage, lunged at me to attack me, and chased me out of her property holding a large kitchen knife, threatening to stab me and my colleague.

I went back to the Office and called the Police woman again and told her what happened. It was only then that she revealed Miss A had a long history of violence against her partners, and against the Police, and in fact on the night of the reported assault, she and her partner had got into a fight and were beating each other up, rather than him beating her up. The violence was reciprocal between them.

In conclusion, the Police deliberately withheld Miss A's long history of violence, which put myself and my colleague at risk from assault and stabbing. In my professional opinion, the Law should not have any bias, and the Police woman should have disclosed Miss A's history of violence for my own protection; along with the fact that the violence was reciprocal.",1.0,3.0,1.0,10.0,/r/MensRights/comments/isi33p/disparity_in_police_handling_of_domestic_violence/,stoicforlife

I don't really know where else to go but this is a claim that can only be made against a man because hes a man. I'm very sorry if anything im saying is incoherent im on the verge of crying as of writing.

Thats it, that's all the contact between the two of us. She was Muslim but was not wearing her hijab at the time and she said that because im a man I shouldn't be touching her as a woman and that this was against her religion and offended her.

When I first saw her without her hijab I told her about a story of when I was a kid in Iran. I told her how I was unfamiliar with the aspect of Iran and once I ran into a party of women in order to get my mom and all the women had their hijab off and they all had to leave the room cause I entered. In Iran its mandatory for women to wear the hijab and because its forced onto them many of them end up resenting it vs enjoying their religion like the people here do. She started crying and telling me about how as a kid she was forced to wear it but now she wears it because she doesn't know anything else. This whole conversation was clam and respectful, at first she was defensive but I explained what I was talking about and we had a actual conversation...

She used that conversation as backup to claim I don't respect her religion and that proves the contact was out of disrespect. I don't know what to do here, there is a fucking news article stating Ive been accused of Islamophobia... I used to practice the damn religion... My freaking boss is a Muslim woman, most of my best friends of Muslim. 

I've contacted the newspaper and they are internally discussing weather to remove the content and the editor in chief says it rests with her but that she wishes to maintain her journalistic integrity.

And so on. 

There seems to be a feminist theory of humor, too. An example of it can be found at the beginning of [this article](https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=english_fac_pubs). The idea is that men are not funnier than women but women laugh at men's jokes more because they are lower in the social hierarchy. 

It doesn't sound right. I have been able to make women laugh at times, but more often I have fallen flat on my face. Often women have ignored me, pretended to laugh or even shown scorn. When a woman laughs at what a man says there is often something else going on than ""establishing women's lower status"". It's like they are signalling whether they accept you or perhaps giving you a chance to try to seduce them. 

Besides, men are on average funnier. They have to be.

2020-09-15 00:18:03,"Homophobia against Gay Men is Due to Misandry, Not Misogyny","That should go without saying. But I've encountered a lot of people who try to make gay men's rights about misogyny and feminism, as if gay men are hated for being ""womanly"". Which is wrong firstly because that's an inaccurate stereotype, that being gay therefore means being effeminate. But also shaming a man for not conforming to society's expectations of manliness [is also misandry and not misogyny](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/8cmpor/males_are_more_restricted_than_females_in_terms/)

But mainly, if it were just about hatred against homosexuality, lesbians would be hated as much as gay men. I [got a message](https://imgur.com/a/Y5dTx3F) recently by someone claiming the opposite, saying that in fact lesbians suffer *more* brutally than gay men do

&gt;I saw your comment a while ago about homophobia and lesbians and I gotta say lesbians suffer brutally more than gay men. That's just how it is.

But the reality is that [Gay men are the victims of violence more often](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2011/narratives/victims). In places where homosexuality is illegal, [it's either just gay male relationships that are legislated against](https://www.humandignitytrust.org/lgbt-the-law/map-of-criminalisation/) or [lesbians (if they're punished at all) face lighter legal consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_by_country_or_territory). And [there's more prejudice against gay men than lesbians in every country](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/lesbians-more-accepted-gay-men-around-world-study-finds-n1118121)

Considering these things, it is very misinformed to think that that homophobia against gay men is solely due to homophobia or God forbid misogyny, and that it has nothing to due with misandry. Of course it's due to misandry which is why it's specifically gay men far more so than lesbians who are targeted the most",1.0,1.0,0.99,25.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iso38l/homophobia_against_gay_men_is_due_to_misandry_not/,HeForeverBleeds

I married a hard-core feminist, maybe not my smartest choice, but I love her and overall I think she is a good woman. Nobody's perfect. Anyway, I am constantly having to deal with the kids being taught bullshit. ""There is no difference whatsoever between facts and opinions."" ""Body fat has no impact on health outcomes."" (not from my wife, but from her crowd) ""To name a thing is to exercise power and thereby do violence to the thing named."" That kind of stuff.

So, we are having a conversation with my 15-year-old step-daughter when she drops a rare compliment. ""Well mom, you turned out good, so your parents must have done a good job raising you."" At this point my wife laughs derisively and says ""Are you kidding? My father never \*bothered\* to parent me. You think he ever lifted a finger to help my mother with us kids?"" I had to call bullshit. ""Didn't you tell me that you rarely saw your father as a child, that he worked 100 hour work weeks, going to work before you got up and getting home after you went to bed? He devoted essentially every minute of the prime of his life to slaving away, to provide for you, and you call that 'not lifting a finger'?"" She replied ""I was just saying he didn't have anything to do with how I turned out."" I replied ""Yes, he did. You had the best of everything. The best food, the best house, the best school, your choice of college, because he sacrificed his life for you. And you repay that by teaching his granddaughter to think less of him?"" She shrugged and the two girls continued the conversation as if nothing had happened.

Men's lives matter. The work we do matters. Masculine traits can be used for good. Feminism is not just about teaching girls that they are as good as, and as important as, men.

They are teaching our children to devalue and disregard men, and I'm tired of it. I work full time, frequently more than 40 hours a week.

Even in the past men had gendered issues, just because the educational system/media don't tell you about them doesn't mean they didn't exist. just read ""The legal subjection of men"" written in 1908 by men's rights advocate Ernest Belfort Bax to know about female privilege and male disadvantage in the united kingdom of 1900.

2020-09-15 11:34:39,My friend is being 'cancelled' for something his accuser admits didn't happen. I've been pretty close with this guy for years and this all seems completely crazy.,"Her post is going viral. 

But the first line in the post is, ""I want to share something that almost happened to me...""

It's been 11 hours, 148 shares, a ridiculous amount of comments, and names named. 

I'm not going to lie, drugs were most likely involved with both parties. And that is one of the things that makes me think this whole escapade is even more bullshit. 

Kinda just want your thoughts. 

Here's the post:


I want to share something that almost happened to me Saturday night in hopes that people (men in particular because I find women are already programmed to look out for each other and watch for these things) will be careful not to put their female friends in vulnerable/ dangerous situations with strange men and/or potential predators.


**TW Sexual Assault**


***Edited to add: his name is [REDACTED] and he works at [REDACTED]***


I had some friends over Saturday night. One of my friend's brought over a guy I don't know.


I had a few interactions with this stranger and my instincts told me he was not to be trusted (women you know that feeling that something isn't quite right). I know from experience to listen to my instincts. Turns out he also set off another female friend's radar after some weird comments (I chatted with her about this Sunday).


Anyway, I wasn't overly worried about him because I was with a group of trusted friends.


At the end of the night everyone had left except for me, 3 guy friends I know and trust, and the stranger.


They were in my kitchen getting ready to leave and I was laying on my couch with my dog with my eyes closed (thankfully not fully asleep, but ready to go to bed).


My 3 friends walked out the door to leave, 1 put a blanket on me thinking I was asleep. I got up when I heard the door close to make sure all the doors were locked and everyone was gone. I had a bit of a weird feeling that someone was still in the house so I walked into the kitchen and found the guy I don't know sitting at my kitchen counter. I asked him to leave because I wanted to go to bed and he didn't listen. He said he would order and uber but didn't and just stayed put.


I went outside where the guys I know still were and said hey guys you can't leave me alone with this guy I don't know. They said he told them him and I had ""a thing"" and that he wanted to stay. Nowhere in any interaction through the night had I expressed any interest in him or desire for him to stay the night to him or anyone else. The opposite actually, I stayed clear of him all night. I was really upset with them for leaving me with a guy who already creeped me out, I don't know, and in a vulnerable position asleep on my couch! To their knowledge I was asleep.

My close guy friend who was also there said this guy told him he was leaving and he thought he was already gone (a genuine mistake - this guy was being sneaky and I am seriously disturbed about how calculated this seems to have been). My friend came back inside to make sure this guy left before I went to sleep and that I was okay. When my friend came back inside the strange guy was literally crouched down hiding in my kitchen! So that someone who came inside at first glance it would look like no one was there. He finally got him to leave with them (he said he'd ordered an uber but the uber never came so clearly he didn't). I checked my house locked up and went to bed. I could not get what could've happened off my mind and was really bothered at the idea.

I found out yesterday this guy I don't know told my friend he ""wasn't being a bro"" and had taken a cialis. So OBVIOUSLY this guy had some seriously bad intentions. My instincts were right. He tried to hide and stay behind with the female host who was alone and sleeping, lied to me and my friends about ordering an uber, took a fucking cialis, and hid in my kitchen while the last couple guys left? UGH.

Truth be told - this is almost exactly the circumstances in which a male ""friend"" raped me as a teen. A girl friend of mine left me sleeping at his house, thinking I was safe.

I am grateful that I know better than to go to sleep at a gathering without making sure things are okay and I either have close friends there looking out for me or everyone is gone. It's BS that women constantly have to be on edge to prevent men from assaulting us but it is what it is.

What also upsets me and I hope my guy friends and other good men learn from this is that you can't just leave your female friends in vulnerable situations like this. Just because some guy tells you he wants to stay or has some sort of ""thing"" with the woman doesn't mean shit. You need to check with that woman. And I guarantee you none of your female friends want you to leave them alone with a strange man they only just met that night while they are asleep.

Anyway, just wanted to share in hopes that what happened to me as a teenager and what could've happened to me Saturday night doesn't happen to another girl or woman. Be safe out there ladies, and everyone please watch out for the women and girls in your lives. Also - listen to your instincts they're usually right.",1.0,1.0,1.0,26.0,/r/MensRights/comments/it0w05/my_friend_is_being_cancelled_for_something_his/,SimilarSam

2020-09-15 21:47:56,Just venting(Rant)," 

I feel like women are trying to push this pro-female culture in grade schools. My son‚Äôs teacher automatically responds to students with phrases like, you go girl. The teacher assistant automatically assumes the parents are women. It‚Äôs bullshit. Don‚Äôt they know that there are males in this world? And if they don‚Äôt know if a person is male or female, then why do they automatically respond with a female in mind? Why can‚Äôt they simply say: Good Job, You did it, Excellent? Why does it have to be: You go girl, and yes ma‚Äôam? I feel like it‚Äôs a closed-minded mentality. And these people are the woman that are teaching our children and running the schools. Before the pandemic, I have experienced constant bias by the women in the schools. As if, because I‚Äôm a man, I couldn‚Äôt possibly be competent or a good parent. Even though I‚Äôm the parent that handles my son‚Äôs schooling. Even though I‚Äôm always there, I‚Äôm the parent that they deal with, my son always gets good grades, and I always volunteer to help out with field trips and the like. 

I understand that traditionally it‚Äôs been the women that handle the children and their schooling. And now in this pandemic, we don‚Äôt actually see each other most of the time. Communication is handled a lot through messages and emails. But if you don‚Äôt always know who‚Äôs on the other end, why assume it‚Äôs a girl/woman. My son is a boy. He‚Äôs a student. When they're not in a video class, the teachers and staff always assume the student is a girl. Don‚Äôt they know boys go to school as well? I know I‚Äôm just venting here. But this is the 3rd school my kid has gone to and this ‚Äúpro-female‚Äù trend has been consistent with all 3 schools. It‚Äôs really making wonder WTH is really going on in society? I‚Äôve had chit-chats with other dads over the years and during this pandemic where I find that they notice the same things I do. So... this isn‚Äôt just me being a prick here. I‚Äôm all for women being treated equally. I believe it‚Äôll lead to a better society for all. But I feel like they‚Äôre trying to put girls above boys instead of ACTUALLY treating them like their equals. There are a number of other things I‚Äôve noticed this mentality is in over the years dealing with my son‚Äôs schools. From disciplinary actions, recognition, etc. I just feel like everything is meant to benefit the females and our boys are being ignored or even left behind.

All I‚Äôm saying is it‚Äôs the 21st century. We are supposed to be working hard for equality. Feminists are always screaming about equality between males and females. However, I feel that it‚Äôs not actually the case. That us men are looked down upon and not to be treated fairly. (I know from personal experience that family court definitely doesn't!)

I‚Äôm not bashing women here. A number of them are actually excellent teachers. I could never do (nor want to do) the job they do in teaching our children. I tip my hat to them. Some of these kids and their parents are absolute monsters, and teaching, in general, is hard enough as it is. More power to them for doing these jobs and dealing with these people. HOWEVER, I think there‚Äôs a ‚Äúpro-female culture‚Äù plaguing our grade schools that will end up causing harm in society in the years to come. I think the need to empower females has gone too far and we need to scale it back a bit and re-examen what we‚Äôre actually believing is ‚Äúequal‚Äù these days. I don‚Äôt think anyone is at fault here. I just think that every now and then we as a people need to take a step back and take stock of what‚Äôs going on.",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/MensRights/comments/it93l0/just_ventingrant/,Manronx

2020-09-15 23:45:59,I'm gonna get hella downvoted for this...,"One thing I want to clarify, I'm a men's rights activist. I've had misandry directed at me in the past, and it wasn't exactly fun. I just see a lot of hate for feminists that i don't think is justified.

I don't think feminists are bad. Well, the majority of them. Maybe it's location, maybe it's just where i look on the internet, but the majority of feminists i know are good, honest people who harbor no ill will towards men. 

My mother is a feminist, and i know for a fact she doesn't hate men. My sisters are feminists, and i know for a fact they don't hate men. Most of my female friends are feminists, and i know for a fact the majority of them don't hate men.

So far, all the hate for men i've seen has come from the internet.

One big problem i think this sub has is that you all think that every feminist is out to kill all men, but that just isn't the case. 

TO CLARIFY: THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY SOME HORRIBLE, AWFUL FEMINISTS OUT THERE. The thing is the majority of feminists aren't horrible, awful people - it's the vocal minority (it's also this vocal minority that has the most impact, but that's not what I'm talking about right now).

Hop on r/feminism, and just scroll for 5 or 10 minutes. Count how many things you see that simply support women, and how many things you see that degrade men. Now hope on r/femaledatingstrategy. Huge difference.

The reason for this is because the normal feminists flock to r/feminism, which makes sense. The VOCAL MINORITY flocks to r/femaledatingstrategy. The problem is that the vocal minority has a louder voice. 

People who are horrible, awful feminists are more likely to tell you about their ideologies than a normal feminist is. When they spout their nonsense, they get a lot of attention, which causes people to hate on feminists, even though most feminists don't actually believe what the nonsense that person said.

I've looked through this sub for a bit and i just wanted to say this. Think of feminists in the same way you think of men. The bad feminists believe all men are nothing but horny rapists who want to get into every single girl's pants, but we know better than that. We know that the majority of men aren't like that at all. I used to think that every feminist was a man-hating piece of shit, but then i educated myself. I now know that the majority aren't like that at all. You can too. 

The reason i bring this up is because of the amount of hate i see for feminists here. It pains me to see that the names of my mother, my sisters, and my friends are being besmirched by a group of people whose ideologies do not represent theirs. I also believe that if we were to educate the feminists on why men's rights matter too, we could get a lot more done than by separating our groups with nothing but hate. When someone says that they hate feminists, feminists don't think they're saying ""i hate people who say kill all men"". Feminists think they're saying ""i hate people who don't think that all women should be in the kitchen"". When a feminist says they hate men's rights activists, you don't think they're saying ""i hate people who say that all feminists are horrible people"", you think they're saying ""i hate people who think that men don't deserve death"". This misinterpretation just breeds more and more hate, until both groups hate each other over ideologies most of them don't have.

I understand that i probably won't change anyone's mind. That just usually doesn't happen on an internet conversation. But, if you do want to talk about it and see more about my point of view, feel free to comment and ask.

Time for the downvotes.

(Note: i wanted to point out places like twitter or tumblr, who have an abnormal amount of crazies who believe men are trash. Hell, on tumblr, people legit *brag* about being misandrists. To this i'd like to point out that if you hang around in a sewer, all you'll find is shit. They flocked to those apps, that just means they have a hivemind, in the same way reddit has a hivemind. People who have differing opinions than that hivemind get trash-talked and shit on. There are normal feminists on twitter and tumblr, they just don't want to speak up because if your political opinion is anything other than ""men deserve to die slow and painful deaths"" on those apps, you're not going to get much support)",1.0,1.0,1.0,61.0,/r/MensRights/comments/itbd01/im_gonna_get_hella_downvoted_for_this/,ARCFacility

They‚Äôre trying to redefine masculinity and change the social hierarchy by placing kind, and empathetic men at the top, and telling competetive, and hard men that they are contributing to toxic masculinity.

The problem is that we can‚Äôt solve the crisis of masculinity by giving everyone a participation medal, and telling those who‚Äôre trying to compete that they‚Äôre making everyone feel bad.

Men compete all the time, in your friend group you compete in beeing the funniest, running the fastest, making the most money. Men push each other all the time to become the best versions of themselves. But we also help each other out, we pick each other up, and we make sure that at the end of the day we‚Äôre all friends.

Competition is a part of being a man, there‚Äôs no way denying that, and trying to pretend like it‚Äôs not is only going to make things worse. We need to approach this in a ¬´how can we do this in a healthy and productive manner¬ª instead of ¬´since this for some dosen‚Äôt seem to work out, the system should be abolished¬ª. The goal can‚Äôt be that all men should succeed, but we should try to remove the barriers, and even the playingfield. 

I have a plea to everyone who reads this. Don‚Äôt deny yourself your inner need be the best at something. True masculinity is realizing your fullest potential, and then using the power and resource you gain from that in a responsible and fair way.

I replied:

I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice.

Your local child support agency took federal taxpayer dollars and may have fraudulently claimed they would provide child support enforcement for children of fathers in a non-discriminatory manner.

The fact pattern you describe suggests they they have devised a scheme or artifice to defraud or embezzle from the children the support they are due, a federal crime:

&gt; (a)Whoever, if the circumstance described in subsection (b) of this section exists‚Äî (1)being an agent of an organization, or of a State, local, or Indian tribal government, or any agency thereof‚Äî (A)embezzles, steals, obtains by fraud, or otherwise without authority knowingly converts to the use of any person other than the rightful owner or intentionally misapplies, property that‚Äî (i)is valued at $5,000 or more, and

&gt; 18 U.S. Code ¬ß‚ÄØ666.Theft or bribery concerning programs receiving Federal funds

&gt; https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/666

&gt; Whoever, having devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud, or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, transmits or causes to be transmitted by means of wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce, any writings, signs, signals, pictures, or sounds for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

&gt; 18 U.S. Code ¬ß‚ÄØ1343.Fraud by wire, radio, or television

https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1343 

This sounds like mom is engaged in financial abuse of dad and kids, a form of domestic violence, and this agency may have also illegally denied them access to services for victims of domestic violence. This is also a possible federal crime.

""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of actual or perceived  ...sex..be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination underany program or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under [VAWA]""
https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/ovw/legacy/2014/06/20/faqs-ngc-vawa.pdf

This apparent deception on the part of the authorities may be a form of child abuse, and the professionals who are acting in a capacity to protect dad's children instead may have engaged in financial abuse of those children, and likely failed to report their own child abuse, a possible federal crime.

&gt; A person who, while engaged in a professional capacity or activity described in subsection (b) of section 226 of the Victims of Child Abuse Act of 1990 on Federal land or in a federally operated (or contracted) facility, or a covered individual as described in subsection (a)(2) of such section 226 who, learns of facts that give reason to suspect that a child has suffered an incident of child abuse, as defined in subsection (c) of that section, and fails to make a timely report as required by subsection (a) of that section, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 1 year or both.

18 U.S. Code ¬ß‚ÄØ2258.Failure to report child abuse

https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258

Dad has a fundamental right to raise his children. Failure to reasonably enforce child support prevents him from using family resources to support them, and likely prevented him from providing for his kids in the manner he wished. For example, he perhaps was unable to provide for them the vacations they deserved, or give them extra tutoring or provide them money for sports, camps, and other activities he would have otherwise done if he had these funds.

""There is a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment for a parent to oversee the care, custody, and control of a child.""

Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000)
https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/530/57/

A deliberate failure to enforce mom's child support obligation is a possible criminal conspiracy against rights:

""If two or more persons conspire to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate any person in any State, Territory, Commonwealth, Possession, or District in the free exercise or enjoyment of any right or privilege secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States, or because of his having so exercised the same; or""

Anyone may report federal crimes to the FBI.

(202)324-3000
http://tips.fbi.gov/

State child support, parenting time, and child protection are all primarily funded under federal law Title IV-D and Title IV-E.

Anyone who has experienced any form of corruption, including possible crimes, may file a complaint with:

HHS Office of Inspector General
Phone. 1-800-HHS-TIPS (1-800-447-8477)
https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/report-fraud/contact.asp 

Anyone who has experienced discrimination or violations of their civil rights, including sex discrimination, may file a complaint with:

HHS Office of Civil Rights 
https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/filing-a-complaint/index.html

Because Title IV-D child support funds are used to support officers who enforce child support obligations, the failure of the agency to properly notify police under contract is also a violation of the civil rights of dad to support of law enforcement, a violation which the US Department of Justice Office of Civil Rights may consider. If I were dad, I might consider filing a complaint with them.

&gt; The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, created in 1957 by the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, works to uphold the civil and constitutional rights of all Americans, particularly some of the most vulnerable members of our society. The Division enforces federal statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, disability, religion, familial status and national origin.

A woman who has a ‚Äútumultuous history‚Äù with police has had her small size taken into consideration when a magistrate fined her for assaulting an officer.

A woman who has a ‚Äútumultuous history‚Äù with police has had her small size taken into consideration when a magistrate fined her for assaulting an officer.

Shanniah Melody Rose King jumped on Detective Senior Constable Nick Bach‚Äôs back in a bid to hold off police from entering a shed where drug paraphernalia was eventually located.

King, 21, pleaded guilty to one count each of assault police, possessing utensils or pipes that had been used, possessing cannabis, and breach of bail.

Police prosecutor Acting Sergeant Tim Madsen said King spotted police arrive at the property through the blinds and had made attempted to call out to her partner and warn them of a search warrant.

‚ÄúThe victim officer ran to her, she tried to stop the officer by standing in front of him with her harms spread, she tried to alert her partner who was in the back yard so he could gain access to the other entry of the shed,‚Äù Acting Sgt Madsen said.

He said the force of King jumping on Senior Constable Bach‚Äôs back caused the two of them to fall to the ground.

‚ÄúShe continued to resist, yelling profanities at police and obstructing further,‚Äù he said.

The court heard a glass pipe and cone pieces were located as well as less than 1g of cannabis and was for personal use only.

Defence solicitor Andrew Peel said King had a tumultuous relationship with Queensland Police and that she had spent more than six hours in the watch house following the event.

Magistrate Peter Smid said he took into account King‚Äôs small size.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not as if a big male wrestler assaulted police ‚Ä¶,‚Äù Mr Smid said.

King was fined a total of $550 for all offences except the breach of bail, no convictions were recorded.

I have no issue with it as it's a huge problem for mostly women (btw men can get it too and are generally shunned from support groups for those who have it).

However, prostate cancer shows almost identical side affects and kill rate, yet it is not nearly as funded as breast cancer. 

Statistics have shown that one in eight women will contract breast cancer and one in seven men will contract prostate Cancer.

Now imagine a woman slut shame and insult other women, the society will say she has ""internilized sexism""

2020-09-17 03:15:44,"Women could, and did, own property and have rights throughout most of history. The idea that women were ""second class citizens"" compared to men is a gross mischaracterization, the origins of which have effectively been debunked.","There is a lot of misinformation about the supposed ""historical oppression"" of women.  While I don't deny that there were some unequal gender norms and practices (which usually went *both ways*), a lot of the claims around this topic are simply not true.

Most of these ""exaggerated"" claims can be traced back to a single source authored by a man named Sir William Blackstone who lived in England during the 1700s. He wrote about the system of coverture in Europe, which was a form of marriage practiced at the time.

Pretty much everything he wrote on this topic has since been debunked, and even he admitted that what he wrote wasn't true at the time he wrote it (in what he saw as ""enlightened times"" compared to some period in history that he thought he was writing about). The mythology inspired by his writings has nevertheless taken on a life of it's own.

Examples include the idea that women were treated like property, didn't have rights, and could be legally beaten by their husbands.

Many modern day academics even believe these things. They also tend to blindly cite each other in a kind of ""echo chamber"" without checking their sources. Which means that many otherwise credible looking sources on this topic have citation chains that either don't go anywhere, or eventually go back to the debunked claims made by Blackstone.

One academic paper formally analyzed those citation trails and was able to prove this in an objective manner:

######George, M. J. (2007). The ""Great Taboo"" and the Role of Patriarchy in Husband and Wife Abuse.¬†*International Journal of Men's Health*,¬†6(1).

https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1855/f217b082603d0ab37ea80c4741fceb8a4a23.pdf

He was looking specifically at the claim that wife beating used to be legal. And besides providing plenty of evidence that it wasn't, he also called out these ""Blackstone inspired papers"" that were claiming it was true.

Another source from 1946 written by a female historian and suffragette dove into the history of some of these claims and discovered pretty much the same thing.  She was upset that women's accomplishments in history were being downplayed by supposed ""women's advocates"" because they were hell-bent on proving that women were oppressed.

She went on to write an entire book about women's accomplishments in history in order to disprove this idea.

Here is one excerpt from her book where she tackles the fact that Blackstone was pretty much their only ""source"" that women were oppressed in history.

&gt;When did this idea originate? By whom was it originated? In what circumstances was it formulated? Why did it obtain such an empire over human minds? In short, what is its real nature and origin?

&gt;If one works backward in history hunting for the origin of this idea, one encounters, near the middle of the nineteenth century, two illuminating facts: (1) the idea was first given its most complete and categorical form by American women who were in rebellion against what they regarded as restraints on their liberty; (2) the authority whom they most commonly cited in support of systematic presentations of the idea was Sir William Blackstone, author of Commentaries on the Laws of England ‚Äì the laws of the mother country adopted in part by her offspring in the new world (see below, Chapter V). The first volume of this work appeared in 1765 and the passage from that volume which was used with unfailing reiteration by insurgent women in America was taken from Blackstone‚Äôs chapter entitled ‚ÄúOf Husband and Wife.‚Äù

And another except:

&gt;Since such were the rights of women in Equity as things stood in 1836, fortified by a long line of precedents stretching back through the centuries, **it seems perfectly plain that the dogma of woman‚Äôs complete historic subjection to man must be rated as one of the most fantastic myths ever created by the human mind.**

(Emphasis added)

######Beard, Mary. (1946). *Woman as a Force in History.* Macmillan, New York.

https://www.marxists.org/archive/beard/woman-force/index.htm

I included a list of bullet points below which are mainly about Medieval Europe, although some can be traced back to Roman times. At least one source containing evidence about divorced wives goes back to 597 CE.  

A short summary about how men are equally as oppressed in Arabic societies (in often opposite ways from women) can be found here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/c9tsso/one_of_my_favourite_comments_from_girlwriteswhat/

Some more information about female power structures that often get ignored by researchers can be found here:

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/g3l1d1/public_and_private_politics_women_in_the_middle/

https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/ae.1974.1.3.02a00100
 
Many people will swear up and down that woman had fewer rights not just in Arabic cultures, but also in Europe, and will point to the legal concept of coverture (as interpreted by Blackstone) to prove that.

Not only is this view factually wrong, I think it does a great disservice to the real world accomplishments of women in history that are often brushed aside to peddle this agenda.

So to summarize:

* As a kind of default, property was held in the husband's name on behalf of the marital unit that also included the wife. *The husband was only entitled to half of it*, much like how marriage tends to work today (which many people, [including contemporaries from the time](https://archive.org/details/legalsubjection00baxgoog/), thought was unfair to men, not women).

* Husbands and wives were treated as a joint entity under the husband's name in common law for *trivial* matters, but in higher courts (known as courts of equity), they could also be treated as distinct persons.  That means married couples could, and did, engage in contracts with each other, sue each other, and have separate estates, debts, and interests.  A wife was not bound to her husband and her rights did not derive from him in any way.

* Men were not allowed to beat their wives. Spouses could, and did, prosecute each other for domestic violence in court.  **Court records from that time period prove this.** (In the US, domestic violence laws at the federal level weren't passed untill around 1920, but domestic violence was still prosecuted under regular assault laws before that time; it was never actually *legal*, unlike what some people try to twist this around to mean).

* Dowery was an ""insurance plan"" meant to secure a woman's financial independence in the event that her husband died or divorced her. The modern equivalent is alimony.  It was not a ""payment"" that was used to purchase a wife, and the husband did not own her. The system was unfair to men, not to women, and in modern times we're still trying to get rid of alimony / palimony in the name of gender equality.

* Women could and did divorce their husbands.  **Court records from that time period prove this.** They also tended to get better settlements than the husband did.  Women as far back as 597 CE are recorded as living in estates that once belonged to their ex-husbands.

* Women could and did own property.  **Property deeds and marriage contracts from that time period prove this.**. In fact women owned property independent from their husbands more often than the reverse (what was her's was her's but what was his was usually also her's).

* Women could and did work. **Accounting records from businesses at that time prove this.** There's even evidence that women were paid exactly the same *per unit of output* as men (which is how labor was paid back then). Women did on average earn less which has been taken as evidence of a wage gap. But this was likely based on working hours and productivity differences between men and women, not discrimination.

* Inside the family unit, women were usually in charge, not men.  This was especially true in pre-industrial Europe and is also true today.

* Women could and did hold power in history.  Including running businesses and ruling over entire nations.

* Women received universal suffrage very shortly after men in most parts of the world. The reason it took longer for women was because a person's right to vote was tied to services and obligations that they were required to give to the state.  Things like fire brigades, militia training, the draft, attending caucuses, paying taxes, etc. For men, the right to vote has never been something that was given to them for free, so the idea that women could get it for free wasn't ""obvious"" to people at the time (not even to *other women*).  This nuance has been lost today because men's obligations to the state have largely gone away over time (everything except for the draft, and compulsory military training in countries that still do that). 

* Women were instrumental in building and shaping the world we live in today.  Unlike race or class, men and women have always lived together, shared similar spaces, and occupied the same positions in society.

So because she adopted a kid, my friend has to pay child support toward it.. Luckily it came out to $44.. But still that's stupid.. She adopted a kid and gets to count that as a credit and it factors into what he pays even though her deciding to adopt had nothing to do with him... He is just going to push to drop CS all together since it's only going to be $44 if she agrees to new schedule.

2020-09-17 06:35:34,united is better (let's join feminism and men's rights),"As someone who is a very vocal intersectional feminist, I had often dismissed or ridiculed the men's rights movement because of all the hateful rhetoric towards womxn as well as the determination that womxn are not discriminated against (lack of patriarchal society). However, after doing research, digging up more information, I realised that many feminists (including myself) had a very skewed view of the men's rights movement. A lot of the issues many men's rights activists fight for, I, and many other feminists actually support (mental health, courtroom bias, etc). As someone who's definition of feminism is the theory of the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes, I find it frustrating that men's rights issues are not included in feminist rhetoric. So this begs the question-- why don't we fight together? As a person of color, who was often excluded from early feminist speech, I also very much understand the notion that feminism isn't really fighting for all of us. However, I also feel, that through awareness, empathy, and understanding, feminism can be another platform in which we can discuss men's rights issues on a larger scale than ever before. I genuinely think that by raising awareness and making the Feminist community more aware of men's rights issues, we can make feminism better and more inclusive and true to its original definition. Doing this requires work, and effort, and open dialogue, but I think it's something that is necessary for both the feminist and the men's rights movements.

2020-09-17 08:37:02,"""A Man's World"" on boyhood in the UK 1900 to 1960","I just watched a BBC 1995 programme ""A Man's World"" on boyhood in the UK 1900 to 1960.

A book was also made of the same name (see below).

I don't see how it could be described as an easy life. As they point out at one stage, ""a boy it was widely assumed had to be prepared for the harshness of life ahead"". 

So even young boys were expected to toughen up and not supported by their fathers and often their mothers if they had anxieties e.g. about the dark. 

Corporal punishment was common: they mainly described what happened in schools. 

They were encouraged not to cry (or show emotion), and one man describes stifling any crying at the funeral of his mother, who died when he was 11 years old. Another man describes how he lost respect for his father when his father broke down a bit at one time after a divorce when he was sad that he didn't get much time with his son.

There was some descriptions of having to do menial work to get money. Families who had some money also often sent their boys to boarding schools at a fairly young age, e.g. 7-9 and this was upsetting for some. Schools involved a lot of rote learning.

Boys were encouraged to fight physically rather than back down or run away if challenged.

It mentions how males often then got conscripted to fight when they were older and of course, although it doesn't mention it, military service also existed.

Life for girls wasn't necessarily easy, but I think it would be hard to argue that life was easier for boys.

Book: A Man's World: From Boyhood to Manhood, 1900-60

""Until recent years the distinction between masculine and feminine behaviour was far more rigid that it is today, and men wielded much greater power. Yet behind the burning ambition to be a ""real man"" there were many anxieties, conflicts and contradictions. This book, which ties in with a BBC2 television series, explores six icons of masculine behaviour - the boy, rites of manhood, the soldier, the worker, the father, and the lover - and considers the realities behind them.""",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iu8mua/a_mans_world_on_boyhood_in_the_uk_1900_to_1960/,wntk

2020-09-17 10:32:49,I could use ideas for my men's day docu series,"Hi guys, a few months ago I posted about my interest in doing a 'men's day' docu series focusing on the pillar of 'role models'. My intent is to find 10 or so men and make a 10 or so minute long video introducing them to the world, their life, their passions, etc.

Each segment has its own narrative theme that I find through the interviews with the subjects, a sort of 'arc' for their life and what it means. I avoid the cliches like 'never give up' cuz I hate faux positivity or sickly sweet optimism, and instead try to show real men going through something real that isn't restrained by the sort of platitudes our culture has. I have found some really interesting subjects for the documentary, have completed the preliminary work for a lot of them and am already filming the interviews this week (with visually interesting supplemental footage to follow), but I'm at barely half way through the number of subjects I would like to have and am wondering if you guys might have any ideas on the kinds of men I could interview for this and the subjects they could talk about.

As of now, almost each subject is just a man between 20 and 40 who is pursuing some passion with the hopes of doing it professionally some day. So far I have a music composer, a skateboarder, amd a BMX bike rider, and two subjects who already broke into the career they want: a therapist and a toy designer.

All of these men have made this their focus for career (even if they aren't making money off of it yet), but I'd enjoy to include men who have a hobby they love that they aren't trying to escalate to a career, who aren't 'chasing a dream'. 

Do you guys have any recommendations for that, or even just other career driven ideas I can scope out for? So far I found most of the people through a craigslist ad, so its been a lot of performers of different types applying, but I found the skateboarder by going to a skate park and scoping one out in particular because I had a particular interest in featuring one. I could scope subjects out in other ways as well, I just don't know where to look because I don't know what kind of man to include. 

Any suggestions? Also open to different angles outside of what I discussed, can't promise I'll take it especially if it's a very 'pointed' idea, but I won't do anything worse than respectfully declining. I am not interested in men talking about men's rights specifically for instance or just highlighting the struggles of divorce, alimony, or other issues men face.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iuajlg/i_could_use_ideas_for_my_mens_day_docu_series/,LonelyBobcat

It's as if feminists didn't see that war is not desirable, and this is not the kind of thing you want. As if they didn't know that men were victims and not heroes of war. This movie, and most of all films that portrait a woman who know how to fight is not very different from action movies with muscled man (Schwarzeneger, Rambo etc...). I don't understand why male sterotypes are toxic, except with a woman. Why a female soldier is more admirable than a woman who take care of her children, or sacrifice everything for her career ?

2020-09-17 22:19:55,B&amp; from /menslub.,"The question:

&gt;I volunteer with a loosely organized coalition that provides harm reduction supplies, food, and wound care for the unsheltered, sex working, and drug using populations of my mid-sized-to-large American city. One of the populations we prioritize highest is sex workers, because of their limited ability to access traditional and institutional resources. (Aka the pimps hate us less than the social workers and will sometimes actually let us treat their abscesses).

&gt;Last month, a man at one of the camps we visit asked for help. Let‚Äôs call him Liam. Liam is an unaffiliated (aka not being trafficked or beholden to a pimp) sex worker. But for a few days now a pimp had been following him, and at one point even chased him down the street. We‚Äôre all pretty sure the pimp was trying to abduct him and traffic him.

&gt;This isn‚Äôt an unfamiliar situation to us, we‚Äôve helped many women get into shelters and will often times make phone calls and press people and be annoying until a bed appears in a safe house.

&gt;But we‚Äôve never helped a man being pursued like this before. Usually adult male sex workers are unaffiliated and engaging in survival sex work. And when they are trafficked, there‚Äôs usually a legal or financial dependency on their abuser, not a physical threat like abduction. (Only in our coalition‚Äôs experiences, I can‚Äôt extrapolate outside the populations we serve).

&gt;So we did our standard operating procedures and went looking for a sex worker or domestic violence shelter that could take him. But we ran into a wall. They were all for women and children. Lots of women‚Äôs shelters and youth shelters were available, but they didn‚Äôt accept men. Even our favorite org to send sex workers to is specifically for trafficked women and children.

&gt;This city is one of the human trafficking epicenters of the nation, and yet no one was helping the male victims! I eventually said screw it, and was going to tell Liam that he should claim to be a pre-op transgender woman and go to one of the LGBT friendly women‚Äôs shelters.

&gt;Luckily, however, when we started making calls and explained the situation, the shelter for trafficked women and children made an exception for him. We haven‚Äôt seen Liam since, so we‚Äôre praying that means he got help and got safe. (We‚Äôre pretty sure he‚Äôs not dead though, the coroner helps our coalition and lets us know when someone matching one of our missing is found).

&gt;But you shouldn‚Äôt need an exception to get help as a male victim of trafficking! The existence of women‚Äôs shelters and youth shelters is important, but there needs to be more resources and help for men who are trafficked.

&gt;(Rant over)

My response:

&gt;But we ran into a wall. They were all for women and children

Yep.

&gt;But you shouldn‚Äôt need an exception to get help as a male victim of trafficking! 

Nope.

&gt;The existence of women‚Äôs shelters and youth shelters is important, but there needs to be more resources and help for men who are trafficked.

Yep.

But there aren't.  Here's why: feminists [suppress the knowledge proving that it's necessary](http://removeddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/fdodu0/jordan_peterson_absolutely_obliterates_radical/fjj3c9h/.compact)

And men who try, face huge political opposition.  One shelter was changed from a male shelter to a female shelter because all men are obviously evil.

I‚Äôm currently deciding what topic to do. I‚Äôm really interested in politics so my EPQ will be politically themed. Over the last few years I‚Äôve kept an eye on feminism and MRAs- I think there are some really interesting conversations to be had. 

Two of the titles I‚Äôm considering are ‚Äúdoes modern feminism really want equality?‚Äù and ‚Äúare men disadvantaged in modern society?‚Äù. Now I believe that 3rd/4th wave feminism absolutely doesn‚Äôt want equality and that women are no where near oppressed but rather advantaged in many aspects. 

I‚Äôm expected to research my chosen topic thoroughly and so I thought I‚Äôd put it to you guys on some of things that would be useful to include. The more research and material I can get my hands on, the better!

I am still relatively new to this group, and I spend a lot of time reading and listening to others here to get a better understanding of how others feel. From all of the things I have seen that has been shared here, almost every single thing is valid and needs to be addressed. The problem is that we are the only ones who address it. The news doesn't cover these issues, and the majority of women don't either. 
With the posting of the boy being hit multiple times by the girl, he ended up having to defend himself and was suspended as a result. There are lawyers that will definitely take cases like this, and it needs to be done. Cancel culture has become ridiculous,  but specifically targets men and Republicans. I don't care what political party someone is in, but we all deserve to be treated equally and with respect. If legal action is taken to hold the schools, colleges and businesses accountable for unfair treatment towards men, I think a lot of the issues we are seeing will go away. Right now nothing is being done to stand up for men, so they will continue to push on the boundaries and see how far they can take it. If I am wrong in my assessment, please let me know, but I think its an important issue that consequences need to be addressed publicly.  Not only that, but if these places start losing money from lawsuits, they will quickly change their behavior and enforce the same standards to women as they do to men.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iuse80/we_need_to_stand_up_for_ourselves_and_others/,Darktide32

I just keep thinking about if the roles were reversed, and if the teacher said that teenage girls are stupid, aggressive, etc.. and the other things, it would be sexist or misogynist.

2020-09-19 08:59:54,Greek contemporaries like Aristotle and Plutarch wrote that Spartan women lived lives of luxury largely off the backs of men,"I'm sure most people are aware that Spartan society was extremely militaristic and brutal to men.

Boys were taken from their mothers at a young age and were thrown into the wilderness to survive on their own. And that was just the start of their training. Which all men, including royalty, were subjected to.

Here are a few excerpts from *The Privileged Sex* (a good book about stuff like this) that I found interesting.

The brutality of military training:

&gt;So rough was the Spartan *agoge*, or education course for males, that Artistotle thought it was more suitable for beasts than for men.

Inheritance and property ownership among women:

&gt;In Sparta, if Aristotle and after him Plutarch may be believed,[480] so many men were killed in war that heiresses were numerous and extremely powerful. By the 4th century B.C women owned two-fifths of all public land and a major proportion of private land as well. When Spartan mothers demanded that their sons return from war, either with their shields or on them, they may have been motivated by more than pride alone.

And the lifestyle that Spartan women enjoyed:

&gt;In neither Athens nor Sparta were upper class women expected to work.[943] In the latter, so crass was the contrast between the ‚ÄúSpartan‚Äù life of men and the luxurious ways of women that Aristotle blamed it for the city‚Äôs decline.[944]

The sources that are cited are,

######Aristotle, *Politics*, 1270a 23-4

######Plutarch, *Agis*, 7.3-4.

And a contemporary source,

######Pomeroy, *Families in Classical and Hellenistic Greece*, p. 54

I was able to find Plutarch's *Agis* online here:

http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Agis*.html

There are a few passages that hint at the drastically different lives that men and women led but probably the most direct are these two:

&gt;Therefore, even before he had reached his twentieth year, and although he had been reared amid the **wealth and luxury of women**, namely, his mother Agesistrata and his grandmother Archidamia (**who were the richest people in Sparta**), he at once set his face against pleasures. 

And:

&gt;**The women, lifted up by the young man's high ambition**, were so changed in their purposes, and possessed, as it were, by so great an inspiration to take the noble course, 3 that they joined in urging and hastening on the projects of Agis, sent for their friends among the men and invited them to help, and held conference with the women besides, since they were well aware that **the men of Sparta were always obedient to their wives**, and allowed them to meddle in public affairs more than they themselves were allowed to meddle in domestic concerns.

&gt;Now, at this time **the greater part of the wealth of Sparta was in the hands of the women**, and this made the work of Agis a grievous and difficult one. 4 For the women were opposed to it, not only because they would be stripped of **the luxury which, in the general lack of higher culture, made their lives seem happy**, but also because they saw that the honour and influence which they enjoyed in consequence of their wealth would be cut off.

According to the above, women had more wealth than men, lived easier lives, and even had their own political power that was exclusive to them. They then used that political power to encourage men to sacrifice themselves so that women could continue living the lives of luxury that they were already accustomed to.

Does that sound like a society where women didn't have any rights or were oppressed?  And what about men?  What rights did they have?

If you were a man, you could have been king if you were lucky.  But then you'd have to lead your army into battle and do all that kingly stuff while your wife stayed home and enjoyed the fruits of your kingdom. So maybe becoming queen would have been a better aspiration for a Spartan.  Or just a regular woman since they seemed to live pretty easy lives regardless of their social class.",1.0,1.0,1.0,8.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ivimhn/greek_contemporaries_like_aristotle_and_plutarch/,Oncefa2

2020-09-19 12:25:14,I've just discovered that I am a feminist (according to a feminism sub).,"So in one of those subs where feminism is all about hating men, there was an unusual post. One woman was over the moon because her husband had remembered that she was on her period and running low on pads and he went out and bought her some. She said that he must be a feminist.

Since having our baby I do most of the shopping and I also buy feminine hygiene products among the rest of the shopping. It was a little weird at first but I no longer care. 

I don't know what kind of men these feminists know or what they imagine us men to be like. In our case it is easier if I do the shopping while she does other things. I don't feel like I am some kind of hero because I buy 'women stuff'.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ivlpy3/ive_just_discovered_that_i_am_a_feminist/,zogins

2020-09-19 14:53:15,"""The wife is always right.""","Saw a friend on Facebook share that he'd gotten engaged. After scrolling through the comments, I saw someone attempting to give him some marriage advice. He commented that, after six years of being married, he's learned that, ""in every conflict, she's right.""

I hear this phrase from various sources all time, paraphrased in various ways. ""The wife is always right."" Am I the only one that finds this completely ridiculous and disagreeable in every way?

First of all, from a rigorous standpoint, it's flat wrong, and it's of course explicitly sexist against men to boot. Apparently, men are expected to bend over backwards and forgo adherence to logic in order to cave to their wife's assertions. I don't understand why any men would support this attitude. Do they think it's some kind of metaphorical truth that increases your likelihood of getting laid? Or perhaps these men think it's the *only* way to guarantee a chance at some pussy, as if every woman dries up the moment you disagree with them.

On that note, *I find this sentiment to be just as sexist towards women.* Every time I hear or read this advice, I get the impression that these men think women are emotional bottle rockets, ready to burst at any moment when their husbands disagree with them, as if they're incapable of logical discussion. Not only is my wife the polar opposite of this, but if I were to brownnose her every time she said anything, she'd have very little respect for me. In fact, she told me after we married that, first day she met me, she thought I was an asshole, but that she kinda liked it.

Have you ever had someone tell you this advice? What's your take on why it's so popular in our culture?",1.0,1.0,1.0,33.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ivnn6g/the_wife_is_always_right/,jmcsquared

You're being abused by your partner? either you must have done something to deserve it, or you're the abuser.

You were raped by a woman? People will assume you enjoyed it for any number of illogical reasons.

You hang out with your child or young sibling in public? you're a pedophile and will be given dirty looks.

You're walking behind a woman by coincidence? You're following her home to rape her.

You're unattractive and show romantic or sexual interest? you're an entitled creep.

I cant afford to have a family right now, or even a nice a apartment.

2020-09-20 03:53:24,Woke Hollywood now standardizing portrayals of men as weak and stupid.,"Can‚Äôt tell you how many shows I‚Äôve started watching lately (and turned off) that portray men as weak, stupid, and inferior to women. The latest was Jett on Cinemax. The only men who are strong role models in that show, like many others, are those who follow the advice of the strong female lead. 

Since the failed The Last Jedi, which revealed Kathleen Kennedy‚Äôs failed attempt to remake the Star Wars series into a woke propaganda tool, this agenda has become more and more obvious. Oftentimes, it‚Äôs male writers, producers, and directors who are complicit in generating these stereotypes. 

It‚Äôs becoming more and more clear that Hollywood has it out for white males, whom they see as all Trump-supporting, gun-toting, confederate flag waving truck drivers who have to be humiliated Into submission. If you fit into this category, you have to be reprogrammed. If you don‚Äôt, what, you‚Äôre assumed to buy into the stereotype? Or, at least the need to reprogram men through any means necessary.

At this point, men who don‚Äôt fight against this agenda are complicit in it. Liberal men, who have fought to support equal rights for all, have been thrown under the bus by this culture. It has become an agenda that says, women are smarter and more moral than men. They should take over control of society, so that everyone (except men) can be treated equally. 

Historically, Hollywood has portrayed women as weak and subservient to men. Changing that for the better, should mean treating everyone fairly, not just flipping the script.",1.0,1.0,1.0,41.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ivzjm2/woke_hollywood_now_standardizing_portrayals_of/,SmokinJoeStorm

No, feminism was never good, from the begging feminists only focus on areas where women are disadvantaged and ignore the areas where men are disadvantaged.

It was never about real equality. feminism from the first wave promoted a one-sided ‚Äúequality‚Äù, dismantling male advantages while exploiting, reinforcing, preserving, and downplaying female advantages.

Not yet disfigured with friction 
Who'd have thought the dawning 
Would begin that day in the kitchen?


He glimpsed me in his mirror
Shaving cream all over his face 
Curious I bravely stepped nearer
And my heart began to race 


He kindly let me watch him shaving
""Is this what I'll do when I get old?""
A rare moment when he wasn't raving
(At least that is what I was told)


I asked if I could feel his stubble
It was like sandpaper to my touch 
I gazed in wonder at a soap bubble
Perhaps that when I saw too much


His skin was course and rough 
He laughed and I knew I had to go

2020-09-20 19:31:00,I'm tired,"There's a French guy who announced that he wants to make a video about The Red Pill movie and his first arguments are... well, pretty disappointing. He said for example (it's not a translation) :

""They are like South park characters who take data to seriously. Of course men are 99% of death in war, because this stats were made before women could enter in the army."" Hum... what ? It's obvious he don't understand 1) that men are the majority of death in war and 2) that sending ONE gender to war is sexism.

""They are South Park characters when they show a little boy being circumsized and say : Feminists are cutting their pee pee."" 

""The guys who complained to be separated from their children succeed to retrieve them, so this is not a big problem. The real sexism is when we expect that women take care of the children""

There's also this ""these men want to be victims and ignore totally what it is to be a woman"" propaganda.

If you wonder, this video maker is a guy who don't believe that radical feminism is a big thing, that people who complain about them is sexists and if you don't agree with this point of view you are from alt right. But, these guys litteraly send death threats, harassed an autistic guy who didn't agree with him and a trans guy (he said : if you were really trans, you'll know that LGBT community is not transphobic). He's this kind of guy who shows his superior moral and block everyone who not as ""pure"" as him.

2020-09-21 04:06:06,How are Fuckbois born?,"As a dude navigating this SHITSHOW called online dating, it's amazing to see how often many women simply forget and dismiss the fact that men do HAVE FEELINGS and that men ALSO do NOT like to be treated like SHIT or ghosted, or told we are not tall enough, doing enough for your attention, texting enough, making more effort, etc...

I realize that often enough the accepted social narrative is to bash men incessantly, however, take a moment...just a moment to ask yourself...what could the consequences or implications of these actions produce? What lasting effect would this have on our society?

Often through all this I have wondered perhaps...just follow me....just perhaps I dunno...these fuckbois you complain about constantly...did you ever wonder how they orginated? I mean really orginated?

Picture a normal guy, who his entire life wanted nothing but to have a real and honest romantic relationship with an attractive girl. He believes in it with all conviction and having been raised with the same literature and films growing up as a child, he does everything he believes is the right thing to do as a gentleman. He treats her with respect, is responsive, takes her on dates, and never pressures her or crosses any of her boundaries. He may even go out of his way to make her feel happy and in the end, she fucking ghosts him /cheats on him/ friendzones him/ or even better...tells her friends ""he's too nice"" and is no longer interested in him at all.

Meanwhile, this guy continues to observe that all around him these fucking douchebag fuckbois who are essentially treating women like shit aka ignoring messages, cheating with multiple partners, never committing, and constantly lying are in fact having multiple women slobber all over for him and he starts to wonder, perhaps this is the NOT the way?

Recently after observing countless fucking protests for equality, one has to wonder, has it occurred to anyone that perhaps, I dunno...equality MEANS the same for BOTH fucking genders?

Equality is by definition and fundamentally respect for both genders PERIOD. If you want true equality in everything, then perhaps you should I dunno...consider stopping the idea of treating men like shit. We, believe it or not, actually do possess feelings too and though you think we really don't give a shit, many of us actually do give a shit and many of us actually do have a real desire to be in a committed and fulfilling relationship.

Though I do not speak for all men, I can say with some confidence that MOST men do not aspire to be ""fuckbois"". Unless they just get off on hurting people in general aka psychopath.

Fuckbois by definition are sexual manipulators. They use women sexually and discard them. Simple as that.

Good men are out there. But alas, many women just choose to ignore them and go after fuckbois which is why many of them choose to turn into that ""fuckboi"" and in the end they do it not because they truly aspire to be one, they do it because they are tired of being the ""nice guy"" and they are just sick and tired of being ""nice"" and treated like shit.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iwl4rl/how_are_fuckbois_born/,fyp2017

2020-09-21 06:24:43,Mens Rights - Turning Point in Public Perception?,"Men, and women, for the many years I have been interested in fairness to men in society I was largely pessimistic, in terms of the hegemony of the radical feminists in public discussion and in law and policy.  Mens groups who wanted things like shared custody following divorce, fairness in the workplace and judicial sector and so on were 'hate groups', and all public representatives of such 'hate groups' were to be sacked from their jobs and just generally demonised.

I am utterly surprised, but I believe since about 2018 give or take there has been a shift.  I noticed this most of all in the UK media, where man/woman hosted shows would invite male victims of false rape allegations or domestic violence on to tell their stories.  The women hosts were English feminists from wealthy backgrounds, but they were also wives and mothers.  

Then indepdnedent content producers have started talking about mens interests with a gusto, getting 100s of 1000s or even millions of views.  I believe the message has finally reached boys, I don't know this, but I suspect our beautiful, valuable high school boys will have heard our message, that men matter, are equally capable as women to live lives of virtue as well as vice, and deserve fairness.  That would not have been happening five, 10 years ago.   I think this trend is irreversible, because what people concerned with mens rights are saying is so obviously moderate, reasonable, and fair - and the arguments against mens rights so hateful, extreme and convoluted.

Do not get me wrong, I have seen zero move towards fairness in the domains of law or policy or workplace relations.  In fact, more and more jurisdictions have passed more and more increasingly ridiculous laws, like laws that allow judges to say you calling your girlfriend a 'bitch' after she insults you, or you not giving her enough money, means you have been 'emotionally and financially abusive' and therefore she can kick you out of your own house and occupy it with her new boyfriend.  This is perhaps one unecessarily detailed example, but across the board law has continued to get more unfair towards men.  I don't expect this to change, I expect it to continue and worsen.  What I really expect is, when conservative governments are in power, law will worsen slowly for men, then when leftists parties like Democrat and Labour and Green get in power radical changes to erode mens equality will pass into law.  

But, to me, it's an extraordinary change that many men, and some women, realise now what's going on.  This is some help.  If a wife, who leaves her husband for another man, is made aware that the law is unfair to men in divorce proceedings, and if she is somewhat psychologically normal she MIGHT play fairer with the kids, and, less likely, the property settlement.  Men will also, I expect, not blame themselves for an upside-down legal and social environment completely out of their control that deals them sucker-punches to the face once they realise what is going on.

I don't know to what extent Google will try and assert its anti-democratic and leftist-fascistic desires over alternative media talking about mens rights issues.  To what extent will Google the search enginge, and more importantly YouTube, hide content supporting mens' rights?  It's probably doing so already a lot.  But it could do it a lot more.  

I have believed for years and continue to believe that the only achievable goal we have in seeking equality between men and women, and seeking to combat the deliberate, intentional and engineered marginalisation and demonisation of men, is public awareness.  Public awareness is everything.   Feminist ideology has taken over essentially throughout the western world, and in fact is in the process of taking over outside of the western world.  They will not allow us to change the system they have set up - they will jail us, falsely accuse us of crimes, physically attack us, make us lose our job, and publically humiliate us as and when we try.  To me, it's kind of cross between a multi-party dictatorship with feminist ideology the 'Korean Workers Party'-style hegemon, and a new-age pseudoscience but with the stakes, hay bales, and matches of the medieval Catholic church backing it up.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iwnpfl/mens_rights_turning_point_in_public_perception/,playingpoodles

Never said it. 

Second allegation: threw a prayer mat at spouse. 

I picked up the prayer mat from the floor and tossed it on the bed. Not at her. I did because it is considered bad omen (per our religion) to have prayer mat open on the floor without no one praying on it. Prayer mat landed on the complete opposite side of the bed. 

Besides A prayer mat is a 6x2 piece of cloth - hardly, can hurt anyone. 

Third allegation: I threatened to commit suicide by ordering a book from Amazon on the topic of suicide - I did this just to learn about the topic after watching a 60 minutes story in which the book was talked about. Never said anything about committing suicide myself. 

I‚Äôm out of the house, no car, can‚Äôt see the kids. I have hired a lawyer but so far so no concrete strategy from the lawyer, he has said that we will talk next week. 

Spouse has a history of filing stuff and then withdrawing. Prior DVPO also filed and then withdrawn. 

I get that the courts take the attitude of better safe than sorry in these cases. 

But what is one to do? How do you defend against above? One person‚Äôs word against another? What are my chances if I let this go to trial? Even at trial is the approach still going to be: ‚Äúbetter be safe than sorry‚Äù.  Am I destined to loose with no recourse?

2020-09-21 18:08:07,Do you think it‚Äôs inappropriate for a grandfather to wolf whistle at his granddaughter ? (Genuine Question),"    So I came across a post on r/AskFeminists in which the OP shared a story about her grandfather whistling at his very young granddaughter , resulting in making her (the OP) very uncomfortable. After he whistled he then proceeded to explain to his granddaughter that when boys think a girl looks nice they will do that whistle. 
    
Everyone who commented on her post agreed with her. Some of them shared some similar stories of their own. Not only did they all agree with her but they even go as far as to say he was ‚Äútraining her‚Äù to be abused and harassed by men...  In my humble opinion , that is just completely fucking retarded. 

 Now , I‚Äôm genuinely curious if this is actually considered creepy or inappropriate by most people. My grandfather would do the same thing to my younger sister and I never not once found it to be inappropriate. To me it‚Äôs completely innocent and in a way quite wholesome. Back when I was a boy If I wore a little suit or dressed up nice for something my mother would always whistle at me too and tell me how handsome I looked. I admit this would make me feel a bit embarrassed but never uncomfortable.

Nobody wants to talk about this though and some people even think it's misogynistic to bring it up.,"Men and women may not always want to admit to this (for different reasons) but there's research showing that women get their way in relationships far more often than men do.

One study from the 1980s found that women are ""dominant"" over men in 90% of relationships.  Another study found that husbands often report feeling powerless compared to their wives, and that married women report having much more ""control over their lives"" than men do. Another study found that men only ever get their way around 20% of the time when there is a dispute, and that women are visibly and verbally more aggressive and demanding of their partners than men are.  There's even some research showing that this extends outside of relationship contexts also.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3154145/

https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/2018/preliminary/paper/92Gd2Z9E

Historical laws about marriage required men to keep their wives happy and give them a standard of living that they deemed appropriate.  To the point that wives could take out loans and hold their husbands accountable.  They could also force their husbands to satisfy them sexually.  And while the reverse is also true, court records indicate that women took advantage of those laws far more than men did.

Even the ancient Greeks expected men to be subservient to their wives.  To the point that women leveraged this in politics and often had more political power than men did.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/ivimhn/greek_contemporaries_like_aristotle_and_plutarch/

So are things really any different today?  Why are men expected to be obedient and subservient to their spouses? And why does there seem to be a counter narrative in society that, in history at least, things were the other way around?

It seems pretty obvious to me that men, especially when pursuing relationships, are expected to do more for women than the reverse.  And I doubt there have been very many periods of history where this was not true.

Granted not all women demand this behavior out of men. And it may not always be something that's done with malice.  But I think we need to start having a conversation about this in society and stop acting like it's sexist or misogynistic for pointing it out.",1.0,1.0,1.0,35.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ix2uzr/i_feel_like_there_is_an_unwritten_rule_in_society/,Oncefa2

My life has gotten even worse ever since I found out I had been genitally mutilated by the two people who should‚Äôve taken care of me. Psychos try to take away the horror and impact of the phrase and try to make it clinical but calling it circumcision, but I know about all the tissue I lost, the feeling I‚Äôll never feel, the pain I‚Äôll experience for the rest of my life. And when I say pain, it‚Äôs that constant feeling of my exposed glans touching my boxers every damn second of the day. I hate that feeling. Before I found out what genital mutilation was, I thought this was normal. The feeling of unease because my foreskin was gone, the irritation from my boxers and clothes, the lack of sensation when I‚Äôm aroused, the constrained tugging of my right testicle every time I get an erection because the skin that should have been there was stolen from me. I‚Äôve tried foreskin restoration, but depression and suicidal thoughts are occurring at a much faster rate than restoration. I‚Äôm scared, I can‚Äôt trust anyone, I hate my parents, my culture and society, and the garbage religion that did this to me, but nothing will ever make it okay. I‚Äôll never have what was mine back. Never. And it hurts my heart. And I think I‚Äôm giving up. I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Nobody takes men seriously, especially when it comes to being rightfully pissed off for getting a body part removed without their consent. I just don‚Äôt care anymore. I hope I don‚Äôt have to deal with this craphole of a planet for much longer. I can‚Äôt believe I have a biological connection to a specified that does this much damage to their own kind.

2020-09-23 05:59:58,Any good fiction books about men suffering at the hands of women?,"I read a fair bit. Tend to look at what's popular and find something that sounds appealing. 

It has dawned on me recently that I've ended up reading a number of books in which the protagonist is a woman suffering at the hands of men. 

Just read a very popular new one just like that. I loved it. Absolutely nothing against it at all. Later learnt that it was being made into a film by a production company focussed on woman-centric stories. Again, that's fine. More power to you. 

However it got me thinking, are there any novels out there in which the central character is a man suffering at the hands of women?

I grew up with a not particularly nice mother and older sister and am realising that I've not come across many stories that I can identify with in this regard. 

Does anyone have any suggestions?

She then told the principal that I had grabbed her butt, and then she goes on how she went to the locker rooms and started crying.( I had saw her during gym class she was there the whole time). After I went home that evening I told my parents what happened and the raised hell with the school. At one point they had angered my parents so much that my mom threatened to hire a lawyer.

* Men get 61% more time for the same crime.  [Here](https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx)

2020-09-23 21:15:18,Double standards in physical examination,"How come male patients are never asked if they'd like to be examined by the same sex? I've been examined by doctors of both genders throughout my life and remember as a kid when I used to go to checkups with my mother and sister the doctor would always ask them if they prefer a female to do more intimate parts of the exam which she always said yes to and even reminded them of they didn't ask. I don't remember my mother or sister ever having a man do intimate exams on them. However I've been examined by female docs in my intimate areas ever since I was a kid. Growing up I became more and more shy of that and in my most recent examination few months ago I had a female doc with a female chaperone examine me. When it came time for the intimate parts I decided to finally speak up and asked the female doc if any Male doctors are available who can do this instead and she asked if I'm shy then said I'm a grown man and should act like it and it's not something she hasn't seen before and the chaperone giggled at her remark. I didn't want to argue with them so I just went along and removed my pants despite my nervousness. The chaperone even attempted to comfort me saying ""see you look great nothing to be shy about"" after I took my underwear off and the doctor made some comment about me being circumcised and how it looks better. They were both pretty friendly and nice which kind of helped me relax but I still felt awkward being naked in front of 2 women.

2020-09-24 04:24:06,May have lost a job because I am male,"For context: I am a 25 year old male. Fresh out of grad school and planning to apply to physio school this year. I applied for a job as a physiotherapy assistant because with my kinesiology degree, minor in rehabilitation, years of relevant work experience, master's degree studying how pain effects movement, and being a certified personal trainer since I turned 18 I figured I should be plenty qualified to teach people exercises. I also thought it would help me get a good reference for physio school

I get an interview for the job and it goes great. They basically decide based on my resume that I'm a perfect fit before I even go to the interview. I go in and sign the paperwork and they tell me come in on Monday for training. They would like me to primarily be a physio assistant but also run to the front once in a while if there is a phone call or something. 

I walk in on Monday and the lady who runs the front desk who I am supposed to be shadowing tells me she is surprised that they hired me because, as someone who also has to do some work at the front desk, it's strange that they didn't hire a woman because women are so much better at it than men. Weird start but whatever. I spend the whole day working with her, learning how to bill people's insurance, greeting people as they come in, answering the phone, calling patients to make sure they didn't forget about their appointments, etc. I was attentive, I asked questions to clarify things, didn't make any mistakes, overall I thought I had a very good first day. She tells me come back in on Wednesday for more front desk training. Cool. 

Today they text me first thing in the morning and ask if I will come in an hour and a half early. Sure! I can do that! So I go in early and the head physiotherapist sits me down in one of the treatment rooms and explains that whoever is at the front desk is the face of the company. When people come in or call it's the first person they interact with and the person at the desk is responsible for keeping those clients coming back instead of going somewhere else. Without the right person at the front desk the business will fail. 

They decided that I am more than qualified enough for being a physiotherapy assistant and they bet that I don't even need any training I could just start. However, they need someone who is also good on the front desk so they have changed their mind and they will be hiring someone else instead and they sent me home. 

On my way out I tell the lady at the front desk that they said I'm not a good fit for working at reception and she reiterates that it's true because I'm not a female and laughs as I walk out the door. 

Did I just lose my job for being the wrong gender? I thought everything went so well especially since I was hired primarily to treat patients. Then I get called in and totally blind sided that I'm not a good fit for the position even though I thought everything went so well. Am I being overly analytical? Or did I actually just lose my job because I'm a man? 

TL:DR: Started a job as a physiotherapy assistant. Office manager makes a comment on my first day it's weird that they didn't choose a woman. Next day find out they changed their mind about hiring me and I'm fired",1.0,1.0,1.0,56.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iyiami/may_have_lost_a_job_because_i_am_male/,Thepolander

2020-09-24 05:43:37,My thoughts on the wage gap.,"The  gender pay gap is not a myth in the sense that men are indeed paid more  on average than women. This is fact. Men tend to be CEOs more because  they tend to get into higher-paying job fields. They also tend to get  into more dangerous fields where they put their lives on the line in  jobs such as construction, where they have a higher risk of being  electrocuted or getting into freak accidents where they die.

HOWEVER...

This  does not necessarily mean women deserve more money just for being  women. Women, on average, choose to get into lesser-paying job fields.  In modern day North America, women can become CEOS, bank managers, etc.  They just either don't care to (as high-paying jobs also tend to be  highly stressful), likely because they don't find these jobs appealing,  they aren't money-seekers, or their friends and acquaintances aren't in  these fields. And there's nothing wrong with that. They aren't stupid  for doing so. There are so many benefits and advantages of having  lesser-paying jobs. And there's nothing wrong with certain job fields  being populated by one gender more than the other either. Trying to  force 50% of welders to be women is silly.

As  a side note, jobs and colleges should not cater to ""diversity"", they  should cater to the most skilled. Just because you're a woman, Hispanic,  black, or whatever, you shouldn't be entitled to a job either. It's why  the college system is dumb, especially when white people who are  skilled and have good grades are passed over in favor of a ""diverse""  person who is not as skilled and have worse grades. That, in itself, is  just another veiled form of discrimination.

Anyway,  back to my main point, people (especially women) who decry the wage  gap, ignoring all the nuance involved, are annoying.

2020-09-24 10:01:04,"After 2 years, I finally won my custody case after being accused of molesting my daughter","There's a long backstory and if you're super interested, you can look at my post history (I constantly change minor details for anonymity).

Short recap: I've had primary custody of my son and daughter since 2015. Divorce was amicable at first but their mom met a guy on Tinder and went off the deep end. She began accusing me of domestic abuse and calling the cops on me all in an effort to take full custody and move 400 miles away to be with her Tinder guy. It resulted in a settlement out of court giving me primary custody and her secondary custody with her paying very little to no child support.

In the intervening years she failed to utilize a large chunk of custody and ultimately the Tinder guy died under mysterious circumstances. Almost as soon as he died she began showing interest in the kids and we started to communicate and get along. Not a full month after Tinder guy died she was already shacking up with a new guy that supposedly had lots of money. He seemed like a decent guy if not a little immature. Anyways, she told the kids she was moving back locally and everything was groovy up until she got pregnant with his kid and decided she wanted custody of the kids.

We all met for lunch and she sprung the information she was pregnant and wasn't planning to move back to our home state and that she wanted primary custody of my son only. When I had a chance to get the kids in the car and speak to both my ex and her boyfriend in private I said in the most polite way possible that they can get fucked. This resulted in Rich Boy threatening me with his family's deep pockets. Once I got home with the kids I texted my ex wife to let her know I appreciated us getting along for a few months and would like to see it continue that way and that going to court would not end well for her and ultimately be a waste of money for the both of us. I got served court papers a month later stating I molested my daughter and that mom wanted primary custody and child support.

Flash forward until today after almost 2 years of me being in constant anxiety and fear we had our final hearing. My ex attended via Zoom and was already turning on the water works. We had the hearing and the judge ruled in my favor 100%. He saw through her bullshit and didn't have time for it. He awarded me every single penny I spent on litigation (almost 10 grand) and child support of 900/mo.

Honestly I feel disoriented, I'm stunned. Best part is, she quit her job 2 weeks ago thinking if she wasn't working they wouldn't order her to pay child support. Judge wasn't having any of that bullshit either. First payment is due 10/1 and she has to turn over court fees in 90 days. I guess hubby and his deep pockets will have to handle this one...",1.0,2.0,1.0,184.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iyo1dx/after_2_years_i_finally_won_my_custody_case_after/,clearagony

2020-09-25 02:39:57,Toxic Masculinity doesn't exist.,"Nothing anyone does is either masculine or feminine. Take for example anger: obviously both genders get mad, both yell, both might hit someone, both might throw things, and so on. The only thing separating the genders in how they do things. 

If a man hits someone he might sock them in the jaw, and a woman might use a classic bitch-slap. At it's base value it is the same, someone was angry and used violence. That is a toxic trait to have in a person, regardless of gender.

And yelling too. An angry husband raising his voice at his wife is definitely seen as bad. Typical misogynist macho man using his size and volume to cow his wife. But a woman who yells and screams is seen as a jerkz but nobody says toxic femininity.

You can take in the fact that men are generally bigger and more intimidating, but the key word is generally. If a very angry female weight lifter got up in your face and yelled at you, most sensible people would be a little nervous.

The point is, traits commonly associated with toxic masculinity usually aren't masculine, they're just toxic. Masculinity and femininity aren't certain things someone does or has or whatever, its more the way people do them. Masculinity and femininity are essentially purely aesthetic. But of course there might be a way of expressing toxicity unique to a gender, but of course the root is gender neutral and there is usually a parallel for the other gender.

Ellie and Joel in the Last Of Us are both badass hardened survivors who do the same things, fight, hunt, survive, but Ellie isn't masculine at all, she's still very much a girl and Joel very much a man.

Of course the argument can be made that toxic masculinity is more toxic ideas of what a man should be and what is masculine, and in a sense that is a valid point. If toxic masculinity was only defined that way I wouldn't have an issue.

Take for example some toxic expectations / ideals /stereotypes of women. They need to always be cooking or cleaning. They aren't tough. They need to be cottled and sheltered. They are vain, jealous, and nosy gossipers. Nobody calls that toxic femininity. So why are ideas like men shouldn't cry, should be burly and tough, and so on called toxic masculinity? They really should be seen as outdated sexist gender roles. Cause that's what they are.

And some people like to say that masculinity itself has some ingrained toxicity that's exclusive to it. But that's not true. Either the same toxic traits with the masculine aesthetics peeled away can be found in men and women alike. Other things like what I mentioned before might be pure misandrist sexism or plain ignorance of men and their ways.

Like the idea men don't deal with emotions well if they don't cry and that unless they do they are just sticking to that idea that men shouldn't cry. Of course there is no shame in crying, don't get me wrong, but some men, myself included, naturally don't cry much, but I handle my emotions just fine. Whatever flaws I do have in that area don't come from not crying much.

My dad is the same, I saw him cry 3 times in all my life, when my grandparents died and when the Cubs won the world series. I only know for sure of one other time, when my first dog died. Never once did he tell me crying was at all wrong, or give me any other toxic ideal of manhood. The only times he ever said things to me about ""being a man"" was to motivate me or set an example. Like ""don't be afraid, man up, you can do it."" Or ""you need to shape up and plan ahead for your future, you're a 17 year old boy and almost an 18 year old *man*.""

It's a bad example to set for boys and girls that masculinity and manhood are bad, because they aren't, neither is femininity or womanhood. Both are unique and something to be proud of, but neither are restricting. Bravery isn't male exclusive and grace isn't female exclusive, just like how arrogance isn't inherently a male trait and vanity isn't inherently a female one. Positive and negative traits, like anything else, just appear under a person's masculine or feminine exterior.",1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,/r/MensRights/comments/iz31u6/toxic_masculinity_doesnt_exist/,NorthWoodsTraveler

The sources I will site below say that men serve about  63% longer sentences than women, and are about twice as likely to be incarcerated than women.

2020-09-25 19:49:59,New Hate Crime Law in the UK,"Im not too sure how to word this post but recently in the UK there's been a move towards making violence motivated by hate against women to be made a hate crime. While I support this, the wording of the law seems so off to me. While the other aspects of hate crime laws are defined as violence motivated by race, religion and sexual orientation. However, this new law would only include women. this seems so outwardly discriminatory I was wondering if anyone had a different perspective on it that I'm missing.

In my experience women share private images amongst themselves much more than men do I've never shown any of my mates anything I've been sent nor have they with me, however quite a few of the girls I've known have openly admitted to sharing and critiquing the vast number of dick pics they get. 

And on tinder ive seen it in more than a few bio's, personally i can see the unsolicited dick pic being banned soon and rightly so you would flash you cock in the street so why do it online. Also lets be honest it rarely has the intended effect and is likely to see the girl run a mile unless they are a slag and then if thats your level well suppose there no helping either of you.

As per usual this is being portrayed as all men are disgusting pervs and these poor young women are the victims, seems a little hypocritical as on one hand you write something and thats it its out there and can be used against you but you send an image and thats sacred, or what about if you share an only fans image which you have technically brought, id like to see only fans shut down as I think it is solely there to scam and take advantage of lonely men I wonder what the discussion would be if the shoe was on the other foot.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MensRights/comments/izi91p/new_uk_law_around_sexual_images/,carpbasher

2020-09-26 03:56:25,How to prepare for divorce and custody battle?,"Hi guys, 

I am looking for a bit of advice please. I'm in the UK and my wife and I have been having some serious marital issues and recently started counselling, however, my wife doesn't seem to care too much about it and seems to have accepted it as a foregone conclusion.

The advice I am looking for is how to practically record and document behaviours, e.g:

* drinking
* manipulative behaviours
* violence and aggression towards me
* lack of helping around the house
* her lack of care for agreed upon budgets etc. 

I also want to document her attitude towards me and our kids and how she has been acting around them and lack of helping out around the house.

She does occasionally get violent towards me during arguments, never been reciprocated, and has drawn blood twice. However, being the romantic fool that I am, I believed her every time she apologised and promised never to do it again so pictures have since been deleted. 

Is the best thing to do to keep a digital diary or a physical one? How do you record past behaviours and actions? Should I be taking photos and trying to video to support me?

I do not want her to get in any trouble with the police as I do still love her and care for her, but I do not feel my kids will be safe with her on her own if we were to split, so my main concern is fighting for custody.

Thanks in advance, and if this is not the right place to be posting this then I apologise.

2020-09-26 09:39:48,"Shaming and condemning men who are strong and powerful as representations of ""toxic masculinity"" while promoting the exact same traits for women is not equality.","I have always been amazed at how much cognitive dissonance feminists can stomach. They believe women should be strong and powerful. Based on TV representations, this also means extremely confident, dismissive and forceful when they do not get their way. 

Yet a man who is strong, powerful and confident is shamed for being ""toxic"". And we're supposed to believe this is equality. 

Maybe the solution is to let men and women be who we want to be. Support people equally if they're strong, powerful and successful--regardless of gender. Support people who are softer.

She had been acting strange all week and I finally got to see her earlier today that's when she said she didnt see a future with me, I was crushed. She then told me that I'm the most amazing person shes ever met and still wants to keep doing fun things with me. To top it all off we bought tickets to a moonlight ski lift ride on the first and she said that she still wanted me to go. She then asks if I can drive her home because she doesnt want to bike on a busy road.

The kidnapping was made possible after the Hartford Courant published two articles with wrong information let alone titles which were misleading and information which was not verified. The Hartford Courant also mentioned the involvement of Mayor of Hartford Luke Bronin ""who is a very close friend of the grandmother"" who blindly took the side of the grandmother and the mother without checking the facts surrounding the case. Lastly the Hartford Courant mentioned the involvement of the office of Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy in helping the mother and grandmother leave with the children from UAE without knowing any background of the case or respecting the US embassy which chose to stay away from the case as they knew what the mother and grandmother were trying to do for almost 8 months.

I don't know what the lady's argument is, because my blood pressure reached dangerous levels when she recited the feminist claim that false allegations are rare and I needed some medication. I managed to comment before, however.

My comment:

I Stopped listening after the lady made the claim that false allegations of rape are rare. They may appear to be rare, but that is only because the figures are manipulated. In a recent television programme on the subject, it was disclosed that the three high profile false allegations featured did NOT meet the criteria needed to list them as false! In the famous De Freitas case, where the woman was found later to have made a false allegation, the police refused to alter their records, so the case remains one of rape. A well-known writer recently made the claim that they are rare in her book, but gave away the fact that she was referring to cases that had been prosecuted. Only a tiny number of proven false allegations are prosecuted, because, the authorities say, it would not be in the public interest to prosecute more. The public interest, in this case, is not to discourage victims coming forward. A laudable aim, certainly, but one that should not take precedence over reducing the ruination of innocent men and boys' lives. Someone else admitted only cases where the accuser admitted she lied are classified as false. In yet another sly move, about fourteen per cent of allegations are shunted into a group termed ""no crime situations"". These are cases where the woman has accused a man of rape, the police have investigated, and they have found, with certainty, that she was not raped. Various technicalities are used to re-classify the rape as a non-rape and keep the figures low. 

False allegations are not rare. (And the guaranteed anonymity and non-refundable cash payments offered to accusers may have something to do with it.) And police, off the record, will tell you this. Figures of sixty per cent and more come up from time to time. The claim that they are rare is one of the biggest lies ever perpetrated on a civilised nation. Luckily, males are becoming aware of this, and are adjusting their behaviour accordingly. They should put themselves and their safety first, and to hell with the effect on society. 

Likewise, there is no evidence that large numbers of rapes are being committed. Those that claim that that is the case should be asked to present their evidence so that the perpetrators can be prosecuted. They won't be able to, for the simple reason that they don't have any. And no, the feeling in the victim commissioner's gall bladder should not be regarded as evidence.

And, while we are at it, can we make females who force sex on males also guilty of rape? A little sex equality in this area would be appreciated by male victims. Or is it private?",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j04f5g/false_rape_allegation_video/,Wisemanner

2020-09-27 10:19:32,"Most people taken out of Africa during the slave trade were men. However, according to some people, it was really women who suffered the most because they were left behind and had to pick up the slack without their husbands, fathers, and sons around to help provide for them.","Roughly two thirds of people who were enslaved during the transatlantic slave trade were men.

According to this researcher though, the true victims of the slave trade weren't the men who were taken out of their homes, shipped across the ocean, and sold into slavery. It was actually all the women who were left behind in Africa who had to take over tasks that men had traditionally performed.

Which just helps cement the idea that most people only care about men to the extent that they can help do things for women.

&gt;The major impact of the slave trade was not so much the reduction of the total number of people remaining in Africa as fundamental alterations in the ratio of working to dependent populations or of male to female labor. **In this reexamination, the position of women is highlighted, since it is they who suffered the most from the trade in Africa**...First of all, since they retained their normal fertility, the burden of child care imposed on them was not lessened by the loss in population. Second, since there were 20% fewer males to perform work allocated to men during the slave trade era, work was left undone, had to be done by women, or compensated for by purchased items.

Men are being abused like women were in the 1950s

Some (special emphasis on Some) women are being sexist towards men like how men were to women in the 1950s

Men get screwed over by the law more often than women when it was the opposite in the 1950s. For example women get away with a lot of things that could get a man arrested. False rape charges are a good example of this.

Men are expected to work more and do more around the house like women were expected to cook and do more around the house in the 1950s while the mem mostly sat on their asses

There we go. All the examples I can think of right now.

2020-09-28 11:40:04,"[Effort Post] The science and history of why men need equal opportunity, support and recognition for success, and where we stand now","**tl;dr** (the first 4 paragraphs)- Historical sources show opportunity and power are closely tied to who does the work to acquire desired resources (in our society, basically money). This is also correlated with rates of abuse, political representation, selective aborting of fetuses of the gender with less support, among other issues. Today, who does what work is largely dominated by social norms.

People's choices and desires are influenced heavily by these norms--with our theory being that equal opportunity, equal support (including through social media) and equal recognition for success between men and women is key to developing and maintaining equality.

High quality data by demographic group is hard to come by given that society has changed dramatically in the last several years. The best guess is older generations are tilted in favor of men working, people in their 20s and very early 30s are probably somewhere around equal and the younger generation (defined as under 20) is tilted in favor of women. 

We believe this means key variables will show more success for men overall (most people of working age are over 30) but also points to a future in which men will face significantly more challenges than we do today. We should be fixing it now, not waiting for the problem to hit widely viewed metrics before we act.

&amp;#x200B;

**The long version**

Power in non-traditional societies closely tracks how much of a major universally desired resource can be produced by a given group. Plow agriculture, for example, is closely tied to gender unequal societies because ""Unlike the hoe or digging stick, the plow requires significant upper body strength, grip strength, and bursts of power."" This meant men largely did the work and women took on other roles ([study](https://scholar.harvard.edu/nunn/publications/origins-gender-roles-women-and-plough)). The results of plow agriculture, according to the study: ""The estimates show that in countries with a tradition of plough use, women are less likely to participate in the labor market, are less likely to own firms, and are less likely to participate in national politics."" Another [study](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21901.pdf) indicates these societies see higher rates of violence against women and selectively abort female fetuses [article](https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/faculty-and-research/anderson-review/sex-ratios). 

The study above covers patriarchal societies. I do not know of a single study that covers matriarchal societies in a similar way, however one example is The Iroquois. They were an alliance of Native American tribes in the Northeast where women did the farming and controlled politics. While men could and did hold offices and councils, men could not make a decision women could not overrule. ([article](https://www.womenhistoryblog.com/2008/05/iroquois-women.html), knowledge also comes from personal study through my college major). 

There are various theories of what influences gender role desires. Generally though, it comes down to mass media, (I would argue) social media and parents' beliefs and roles ([source 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/), [source 2](https://wnywomensfoundation.org/app/uploads/2017/08/16.-Watching-Gender-How-Stereotypes-in-Movies-and-on-TV-Impact-Kids-Development.pdf)). In addition, what exactly influences motivation is an area of some disagreement. We do know desire of status (ie recognition) is considered a [universal desire](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/05/150506094925.htm) (though what that means differs between people), and people tend to do what is easier (see *Atomic Habits*). 

As a result, we believe it is absolutely critical that both men and women have equal opportunity, support (ie making things easier) and recognition first and foremost for working and secondarily achieving high earning and status positions. Because society has changed dramatically over the last 3 years, we do not have enough data to make a solid statement on where society stands at this point in time in these areas. 

However, we do have data from a survey we recently conducted on Reddit with regard to desires for men and women of various ages with regard to work. We found women have a stronger desire to work than men with about 7% more women indicating the desire than men. However, looking at just those under 20, the gap jumped to 16% more women. This was similar to differences in the desire to be strong (30% higher for girls), powerful (25% higher for girls), kind (20% higher for boys) and soft (20% higher for boys). 

We suspect this is due to stronger recognition for women working, achieving, being strong and powerful than men. We do not believe gaps this large in the opposite of historical direction can be due to any underlying population differences and firmly believe unequal norms are the cause. We believe this means key variables will show more success for men overall (most people of working age are over 30) but also points to a future in which men will face significantly more challenges than we do today.

Fixing this is absolutely essential for the opportunity, support and well-being of future men. We are starting a [sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/FunctionalMasculinity/) (and, slowly, a movement) to work on the issue. Our goal, first and foremost, is to create a societally accepted definition of masculinity which lets men live with agency and purpose, becoming strong, successful, capable and healthy. Check it out and let me know what you think.",1.0,1.0,1.0,50.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j14w11/effort_post_the_science_and_history_of_why_men/,NjalBorgeirsson

2020-09-28 14:09:24,Nervous about requesting male-only partners at work.,"Hey everyone. I work as an EMT with a company that lets us put in requests for people we do not want to work with. I get paired with a female partner very frequently. Obviously, this puts me on edge. Most female EMTs are all-stars and really are awesome to work with, but there are a lot who are frankly very unprofessional. I cannot use cameras or recording devices for HIPPAA compliance. Partners I‚Äôve had openly tell me ‚ÄúMen ain‚Äôt sh**‚Äù and make comments about my personal life that could be seen as harassment were the genders reversed. 

I‚Äôm afraid that if I ask to work with male only partners I will be seen as socially inept and a ‚Äòproblem child‚Äô. My luck has been non-existent on this job and I have already had calls that could have gone better, with one facility we service going out of their way to make me feel concerned for my safety.

If anyone has some advice I‚Äôd love to hear it. Thanks in advance",1.0,1.0,1.0,48.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j16s7q/nervous_about_requesting_maleonly_partners_at_work/,Theo_Stormchaser

2020-09-29 19:43:33,How likely am I to get custody?,"So I have evidence of her doing domestic violence against me in front of our 9 month old child, she was charged with second degree assault on Sunday. The officer told me she could also be charged with child endangerment because when she assaulted me I had our child in my lap, she threw a hard plastic toy at my face, which made me shed blood and bruise, and she could have easily missed my face and hit our child and would have caused serious damage as it bruised and broke my adult skin who knows what it could have done to our infant if it would have hit her head which was very close to me as she was sitting on my lap, then hit me about 2-4 times with a hard plastic broom which also shattered into a bunch of small sharp pieces and could have flown into the eye of our child or cut her skin or she could have missed one of her strikes at me and struck our infant. I also could have dropped our infant while I was being attacked as I was sitting on the edge of the bed. I have pictures of prior domestic violence, just no police report to go with it but I'm sure this recent police report will support the pictures I have of prior domestic assault in-front of our child. She has attacked me multiple times at least 5 times could be more, can't really remember how many times. every attack was in front of our infant or with the infant in my arms. I also have text message evidence that she drives with our infant and has no license not even a permit. I even have text with her saying saying she is going to drive with our infant in the back seat sitting in a high chair instead of a car seat, (you know how you can detach the chair from the high chair) yea she always drives around with the baby like that when she doesn't have the car seat. I want custody of our infant as I don't feel our infant is safe with her as you can see she will endanger the child, do domestic violence against the child's father infront of her eyes or with the baby in my arms. How good of a case do I have to get custody if I have a police report of her assaulting me infront of our child, driving with no license or car seat, domestic violence in front of a child/infant and I'm working on getting her charged with child endangerment as the officer even told me that is what she did but they decided to cut her a break and only charged her with second degree assault. I'm calling the state attorney to have her charged with child endangerment as I mentioned.",1.0,1.0,1.0,18.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j1xmdy/how_likely_am_i_to_get_custody/,Benny2098

This is institutional racism, literally, but of course it will be ignored in the name of 'diversity'.

Are there ANY employers left in the US (foreign multinationals would be fine) that have not gone into full anti-white male discrimination mode? If so, is there a list available somewhere online? Looking to work somewhere that won't discriminate against me for the color of my skill or my XY chromosomes.

2020-09-30 03:52:20,Just wanna get something off me chest,"Story time!

So I'm in a group chat with some ""friends"" (female, let's call them 1,2,3 and 4) who ""share the same humour"" and claim to be about equality.
So one day I drop a good ol'feminazi joke because who doesn't love those. The joke in question was- Hitler: #KillAllJews, Feminazis:#KillAllMen... As these ""friends"" who ""are about equality"" claim to be just that I'm not expecting anything to bad. Of anything I was expecting them to be offended that I compared feminazis to Hitler. 
To put a long story short, 1 gets VERY pissed off, blocks me and removes another - 4
Ok, no big deal is it?
Then, number 2, goes on a whole rant on her story about how men are the worst things ever. 
Some things she said were along the lines of 'men who believe in equal rights, equal rights are disgusting' and 'i hate all men'. Oh and how could I forget 'they all make absolutely hilarious jokes about women'. 'they make fun of female mental health and then complain that no one cares about what they go through as men'. Apparently we all 'drag the LGBTQ community and then moan how they can't get girlfriends who don't cheat on them'.
Men she sees on the internet are the 'worst types of people'.

That's some great equality there, not hating men at all you fucking hypocrite

I, seeing her saying all this bollocks about men, call her out on her shite. Disprove all her shit. Showing how the world really doesn't care about men's issues when it comes to most things such as assault, sexual assault, depression, anxiety and all. How all men are seen by people like her as rapist pigs. Show how women can also be horrific yet have no real consequences. 

This is the funny bit. She responded with 'sources of evidence' to back her logic, all of which took me about 5 seconds to see are also a load of crap. 



Then, to my shock, another wamen (let's call her 5) that I KNOW she talks to, makes a post implying that all men are rapists. It was along the lines of 'instead of teaching women to protect themselves, how about we teach are sons to stop raping and harassing women'. Why yes, because only men are the offenders. And you are not at all responsible for your own safety at all.

Fast forward about 2 weeks and 1 unblocks me. WTF?
Add back expecting 5 years of cuntsplainer bullshit. Surprisingly, I didn't. HOWEVER, I see on her story some feminazi bollocks. 'if lesbians can control themselves around women then maybe it's a guy thing'. Haha yeah, say to the guy who was raped at machete point by a woman that rape and harassment is a 'guy thing'. Hahahahaha, and repost that says ""I hate men, this is the year we exterminate them ladies"". Fuck you and your feminazi propaganda.

 It's just sad because, I go to the same school as all these fuckwits and I already know if I speak up I'll be told to ""stop bitching about people's opinions, man up and deal with it, you're misogynistic"" so like what the flying fuck do I do? I've been bullied pretty much my whole life and had little to no support. I've seen a girl get picked on once and there's something done, support is given and everything. It's to the point where I literally don't want to be around women because if I do one thing wrong, I'm a misogynistic, woman beating, rape supporting pig who would be better off hanging himself than being a detriment to society.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîeverything she‚Äôs talking about are results of systemic power structures implemented by men in a patriarchy. So many men injured in the military? Women were kept out of the military until recently. The change will be a long time coming.  
&gt;  
&gt;It‚Äôs like saying those Black people don‚Äôt sacrifice as much as whites ‚Äî look at the civil war casualties‚Äîall white! Let‚Äôs talk about how much whites have sacrificed in the Civil War and hopefully get around to equality for Blacks. Oh yeah, systemically, that‚Äôs exactly what we did.  
&gt;  
&gt;‚ÄúIf you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.‚Äù  
&gt;  
&gt;I am certain that as we address the inequity for women that it will make things better for men systemically.

This willful ignoring of men's issues and victim-blaming seems all too common.

Rather, I'd tentatively suggest that this sub often defends it's current foundations. It is ok to have a masculine identity, but imo discourse around male identity requires more malleability. Imo, men ought to take an intersectional approach that platforms ppl in the male community who are traditionally underrepresented and allows an exchange of information between ppl of different genders and sexualities. Working to fight gendered oppression requires healthy communication with and representations of men, the queer community, and yes also women's voices. Livng in context of these other seemingly hostile identities can dramatically improve with mutual respect; respect in my book means going out of your way to find reliable and diverse accounts of the identities we find ourselves in contrast to. History, philosophy, and/or firsthand accounts are things I've found very useful in expanding and grounding my views of male identity and feminism. That's me, at least

2020-09-30 18:58:14,Will sex robots fix the current social imbalance in the dating world?,"Recently I was banned by another subreddit for respectively mentioning that female standards have drastically gone up. I didn't get into a fight or anything else, the rather mundate mention was enough.

I would like to ask you guys if you think the status quo will essentially fix itself or not, in terms of power balance in the dating market, when high quality sex robots are available at an affordable price.

I am talking specifically about how girls get hundreds of matches on apps like Tinder, while getting heavier and lazier by the year. While most guys have to network their way to find anyone at all.

I will speculate a few scenarios:

* A big change, somewhere between 10 to 60% of men get a robo girlfriend and drop out of the dating market. But female standards do not go down. The top 5% of men still get all the attention, which has moved entirely onto winner take all online platforms due to ongoing social dysfunction regarding male female interaction and what is deemed acceptable. The remainder of ment continue to pick up scraps or go incelibate.
* A more rosy scenario where maybe 10 to 20% of guys get a robo girlfriend and this fixes the female culture of entitlement. Women begin to readopt traditional female ideals to ""catch a decent guy"". The underlying theory here is that removing the pedestal fixes their mindset and motivates them properly.
* A dystopia where some people get robo spouses, others are in relationships that are brittle. The culture for both sides becomes hyper me-focused.
* A low impact scenario where shaming or price prevents men from getting a robo girl. Maybe they are outright banned in some places. So while a small percent have them, they never make much social impact.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j2jzek/will_sex_robots_fix_the_current_social_imbalance/,javascript_dev

2020-10-01 01:01:48,Steps of learning about a new a pop song,"This is how I learn about new songs:

1. I vaguely hear the melody of a new pop song on the radio. ""Hey, that's pretty catchy. Let's find out what's the title!""
2. Finding out the title... - ""Ava Max: Kings and Queens""
3. Contemplating... ""Ok, maybe it's about her being his queen, and him being her king, and them being happily in love, or something like that...""
4. Disappointment...  
*""If all of the kings had their queens on the throne*  
*We would pop champagne and raise a toast \[...\]*   
*No damsel in distress, don't need to save me*  
*Once I start breathin' fire, you can't tame me*  
*And you might think I'm weak without a sword*  
*But if I had one, it'd be bigger than yours""*  


Seriously... I'm just fucking tired. Why does EVERYTHING have to be about hating men, and making fun of men, and women being better than men... Why? It's so annoying. I can't watch a movie anymore without seeing these tropes. I can't listen to a goddamn trash pop song, I can't download it onto my phone, because I get angry just listening to the lyrics.

2020-10-01 01:02:16,How can we change hearts and minds?," I tried this once before [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/j2b41v/the_societal_issues_men_face_are_a_result_of/) but I used a very inflammatory title and got downvoted to oblivion. I'm trying to open this question one more time.

I posted the factual feminist video on men checking their privilege (A wonderful 5 minute summary of men's issues). A male friend hit me back with this comment:

&gt;Here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîeverything she‚Äôs talking about are results of systemic power structures implemented by men in a patriarchy. So many men injured in the military? Women were kept out of the military until recently. The change will be a long time coming.  
It‚Äôs like saying those Black people don‚Äôt sacrifice as much as whites ‚Äî look at the civil war casualties‚Äîall white! Let‚Äôs talk about how much whites have sacrificed in the Civil War and hopefully get around to equality for Blacks. Oh yeah, systemically, that‚Äôs exactly what we did.  
‚ÄúIf you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together.‚Äù  
I am certain that as we address the inequity for women that it will make things better for men systemically.

This willful ignoring of men's issues and victim-blaming seems all too common.

So, my question: How can we change hearts and minds? How can we make people see us?",1.0,1.0,1.0,16.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j2q327/how_can_we_change_hearts_and_minds/,benjaminjsanders

2020-10-01 03:41:21,Why do a lot of the women who claim to hate men get furious whenever they don't get male attention?,"At least this has been my experience. I'm a woman who takes the city bus everywhere, lives on my own, does my own grocery shopping and other errands, walks around the mall sometimes, goes to restaurants on occasion, and walks around school campus a lot. I use apps to monitor my calorie intake to stay fit after having lost a lot weight in the past. Something I've ALWAYS noticed is that whenever I get hit on by a guy, I get the most hateful looks from other females (my age, younger, and older). Some of them even judge me by calling me a wh0re or slut. Um, excuse me? I have a boyfriend who's very sweet and we're committed to each other. I would never cheat on him (neither would he). A lot of these women also happen to be women who have hate towards men or claim they ""don't need no man"". I mean, I can hear their conversations in school hallways, on the buses, etc.

Yet the moment I'm hit on by a guy, those woman look like they wanna murder me. I can see their expressions from the corner of my eyes. Sometimes my boyfriend will notice how mad the women get too. It doesn't bother him by the way because we trust eachother and he knows I wouldn't betray him. He has a really good heart. This is by no means meant to brag. I just tell the guys that I have a boyfriend already and am not interested in dating anyone else. Then I wish them luck on their journey. The women though who are furious, that's not an exaggeration.

I'm not trying to judge women in general either. That's why I said a lot (in my experience), but not all. In fact, I have some female friends who are very nice people. That being said, why do the women who seem to hate men and/or rudely claim they don't need a man, get so angry when another woman gets male attention? Personally, if there was something (or someone) I didn't like, I wouldn't care who they gave attention to as long as its not me.",1.0,1.0,0.99,33.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j2t5hi/why_do_a_lot_of_the_women_who_claim_to_hate_men/,Fat2Fit91

Pornography objectifies both men and women equally, it objectifies the act of sex and intimacy shared between two partners itself. A caricature if you will of sex is porn. 
The bodies of both the sexes are glorified, not just the woman, it distorts the perception of an individual about sex, instead of seeing it as a very intimate experience between two lovers or partners,the person sees it as a just a way of physical gratification.
The distortion of the body image is also an issue leading to both men and women feeling ashamed of certain aspects of their body.
An issue which plagues both men and women shouldn't just be centered around one sex.

 Everytime i post about the discrimination against men and boys in third world i get similar comments with stupid and  baseless claims ! apparently people are really brainwashed by feminism ! even anti feminists think that women are slaves outside the west and men are privileged kings ! if you don't trust the media when reporting on gender issues in the west why you trust them when reporting on 3 world countries ?! if you agree with them that women are slaves in 3 world countries you should also agree that women are also slaves in the USA, UK and Australia because this what the feminist media say ... 

&amp;#x200B;

Not only domestic violence is NOT legal, but the media only talk about violence against women. just like in the west. here is an article from Ennaharonline the equivalent of CNN in Algeria.

He/She add: 

&gt;Women in Algeria are mostly under control of their husbands, and have little to no control of their own life.

WTF ?! i don't know how to start ! of course this is BS. 60% of college graduate are women. wow you see how women are oppressed ?!

Marriage is defined in the article 4 as:

&gt;marriage is a consesual contract between a man and a woman in the legal forms it has among other goals to found a family based on affection, leniency and mutual help to protect morally the two spouses and to preserve the bonds of family.

I'm not saying women and girls don't have problems and issues, but not more than men and boys. 

Even in Iran women represent 67% of college graduates and they have social programs that are denied to men. 85% of the homless are men.

&gt;The problem is inflating western problems with issues occurring in islamic countries

WHAT ? sexism against men is western problem ?! in my country Algeria men pass 12 month in military service. isn't that sexist ?! A lot of islamic countries has bigger punishment for trafficking if the victims are women and children. isn't that sexist against men ?! 

Misandry is not a western problem, this year the president of Egypt said in his speech that men are lazy and women are doing the bigger work. everyone started laughing and clapping. sound familiar ?!

There is a lot of examples of men's issues in thirdl world countries, example: 

Twelve men are forcibly circumcised in Kenya at the request of their wives (link [here](https://hombresgeneroydebatecritico.wordpress.com/2014/08/16/doce-hombres-son-circuncidados-a-la-fuerza-en-kenya-a-peticion-de-sus-esposas/)) 

Just because the media show us women's issues exclusively we have the illusion that only women are suffering.

Wake up. throw away this false narative ""women victim, men abuser"" ! yes it's false even in islamic countries.

2020-10-01 18:36:58,100.000 boys in risk of cancer,"*This article was in paper version and therefore I can't link. The article is from today. I can, since I am member of Infomedia, get a digital version of it and then I took the article in Google Translate. The translation is pretty accurate.*

Doctors are furious at politicians who have not made HPV virus free for all boys.
""Completely incomprehensible and irresponsible."" Leading doctors are now trying to shout at the politicians at Christiansborg, because almost 100,000 boys can not get a free HPV vaccine and thus risk developing cancerous genital warts.

It is about the boys who were born in 2003, 2004 and 2005. They have to pay several thousand kroner for a vaccination, while the remaining boys under the age of 18 and all the girls can get it for free.

‚ÄúIt makes no sense at all.

It is completely unjustifiable to leave the boys, who are now 15, 16 and 17 years old, at increased risk of developing cancerous and genital warts, because they have to pay for the vaccine themselves. It is a breach of gender equality in the health care system, ¬´says Jan Blaak√¶r, professor and chief physician at Odense University Hospital.

HPV is the most frequently sexually transmitted virus in Denmark, and it can potentially develop into cancer.

Every year, 575 women get cancer as a result of HPV - primarily cervical cancer and anal cancer. 230 men each year get penile cancer, anal cancer and oral cancer as a result of HPV.

Therefore, all girls born after 1984 have been offered free vaccination.

And from September last year, the boys under 18 received the same guarantee.

But the vintages 2003, 2004 and 2005 are not included.

""HPV is extremely contagious, and you can not protect yourself against it unless you are vaccinated or do not have sex,"" says Danny Svane, general practitioner and Ph.D. d. in gynecology.

He shakes his head that the boys who are 15-17 years old today are not covered.

""Potentially, we may experience an increase in genital warts and cancer in this particular group of boys in the future.""

1200 kr. Pr. vaccine

If you are over 15 years old, you must be vaccinated three times to be protected against HPV, and each vaccine costs DKK 1,200.

""It will mean a further distortion in society, where the wealthy are better off because they can afford to buy vaccines for their boys,"" says Danny Svane.

If you do not offer a free vaccine to all young people, it will be more difficult to fight the HPV virus, which is currently found in the body of 4 out of 10 young people under 30 years of age.

""The virus is transmitted by sexual contact, so if three cohorts are not vaccinated, then flock immunity is more difficult to obtain,"" says Jan Blaak√¶r.

It was the former VLAK government and the Danish People's Party that introduced a free HPV vaccine for all boys born after 1 July 2007.

On the latest Finance Act, however, the current majority extended the scheme so that boys born in the second half of 2007 and 2006 are also covered.

But almost 100,000 15-17-year-old boys remain as blacks in the politicians' vaccination program.

‚ÄòI can well understand that someone would like to see that all boys could get a free vaccine. But we have had a lot of clean-up work from the previous government and have had to prioritize the money hard to patch the holes in the health care system, ""says Rasmus Langhoff, health spokesman for the Social Democrats.

So when almost 100,000 boys can not get a free HPV vaccine, then it's about money? ‚ÄúIt would have been great if we could strengthen all parts of the healthcare sector at once. But yes, we will have to prioritize. ‚ÄùAccording to the Ministry of Health, it will cost DKK 132 million. to extend the free vaccination to all boys under 18 years of age.

2020-10-02 00:25:53,Women who are proven to have lied about rape should be required to register as sex offenders.,"First and foremost, there is a difference between having a case dropped because there wasn‚Äôt enough evidence, and having a case dropped because evidence emerged that a false accusation was deliberately made. I‚Äôm not saying women should need to register as sex offenders if their rape case turns up nothing, I‚Äôm saying they should if there‚Äôs evidence they made it all up. I‚Äôm prefacing with this because this is really hard for some people to understand. 

I believe lying about rape is a sexual offense. If peeping on someone is a sex crime, if peeing in public is a sex crime, if lying about STDs is a sex crime, then lying about sex to ruin someone‚Äôs life is ABSOLUTELY a sex crime. 

The point of the registry is to warn people against those who are sexually dangerous. I‚Äôd say men have a right to know if their potential partner has lied about a sexual encounter in the past.

2020-10-02 05:08:49,How to escape an abusive wife while living month-to-month?,"I‚Äôm a 43M professional living paycheck to paycheck. My verbally abusive wife has made my life very difficult since our daughter was born 4 years ago. I have tried everything I can to create a peaceful environment, but she seems very dissatisfied and angry all the time and verbally takes it out on me and our daughter. We have tried a marriage counselor, which she forced me to pay for entirely since she believes I am the one with the problem. We have tried living separately, but couldn‚Äôt sustain that economically.

I am the primary provider (approximately 75% of our income) and she is supposed to work full-time, but it‚Äôs probably more like 30-hrs a week (though she bills for 40-hr weeks). She is an attorney in the state where we reside. My 13-yr old sub-compact economy car is paid for and I have about $4000 in personal cc debt. We rent a modest home and pay for child care of $1200/mo (of which I pay 75% of both).

I cannot take this anymore, but feel trapped. I have spoken to several attorneys and they estimate a simple contentious divorce to be about $10k- and if I were to fight the unlikely battle for custody it‚Äôd be well north of $20k, which I cannot even begin to consider affording nor will I be able to afford to provide for myself and pay the estimated child support even if a way were found to divorce. I feel like I‚Äôm treading water and slipping deeper into depression and anxiety every day.

I fear she may file divorce against me and start collecting support and I won‚Äôt be able to adequately defend myself without an attorney. Her family lives out of the country and she has few friends. My family lives out of state and is not at all in a position to help financially.

Besides sucking it up, keeping my mouth shut, doing whatever she wants and trying not to make her angry, what in the world can I do??",1.0,6.0,1.0,15.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j3hd99/how_to_escape_an_abusive_wife_while_living/,stuckinabox1997

2020-10-02 14:05:30,"Food for thought: based on estimates of wrongful conviction rates being between 2.3% and 5% in the USA, of the 2,200,000 men incarcerated, up to 110,000 of them are innocent. This is over half of the total number of female prisoners nationwide.","Assume that 95% of prisoners are guilty and 5% are innocent. This is the rate given by the Innocence Project, which is one of the greatest authorities on wrongful convictions in the USA. 

Since there are 2,200,000 men incarcerated in the USA, along with 210,000 women, this would mean that about 110,000 of those men and about 10,000 of those women are innocent.

So, it is safe to say that there are about 200,000 guilty women in American prisons. On the other hand, there are 110,000 innocent men. Actually, there are more falsely convicted incarcerated men in the USA than there are women in state prisons.",1.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j3pcan/food_for_thought_based_on_estimates_of_wrongful/,GFStabbedMeIntheBack

October is awareness month for several of our favorite Mental Health Awareness Warriors, 'Zest For Life' causes: Mental Health, Domestic Abuse &amp; Stillbirth / Baby Loss. Their Reddit Profile is here: [https://www.reddit.com/user/zestforlife2020/](https://www.reddit.com/user/zestforlife2020/)

Adam Zest performed, designed and produced this awareness video [https://youtu.be/Gp3v8IID-I8](https://youtu.be/Gp3v8IID-I8) for his cover of Linkin Park's, One More Light in order to raise awareness of Male Mental Health issues and also how Male Survivors of Intimate Partner Abuse / Domestic Abuse struggle with impacts on their Mental Health.

He also recorded it as a tribute to the loss of his own son, Spencer, who was stillborn in 2015 and as a message of love to his two surviving children who he has been separated from.

**We really need YOUR help / voice.**

**Please feel free to like, subscribe and comment / add your voice to the You Tube video to help Adam and us show just how many men are struggling to access mental health support or are being abused, including Parental Alienation, Stalking, emotional, verbal, physical, sexual, psychological, financial and economic abuse from intimate partners.** 

**You can do so via an annonomous account name. Please mention the Country you are from i.e. USA etc as we are preparing to take a case to the World Health Organisation and United Nations to push for better assistance for Male Survivors of abuse / Men's Mental Health.

I just saw an ad for Marks on Youtube and it was of a (I assume) father/ daughter, and the father was black, and the daughter was white.

Plus, there are other ads on Youtube (I think for cars) where there is a couple, and the man is black and the women is white... It seems to be happening with a bit more frequency then random casting choices (which we know are not random).

I never see positive white men in ads.  I never see asian (chinese/ Japanese/ korean) men in ads.  Perhaps it's just me, and I'm seeing or not seeing what I want to see, so I figured I would post something up here and get some other perspectives.

1 point submitted 2 minutes ago by excess_inquisitivity
At the quarterly meeting of the Medico‚ÄìPsychological Association, held in Glasgow on 3 March 1876, Yellowlees presented a paper in which he outlined his technique of piercing the foreskin at the very root of the glans with an ordinary silver needle and tying the ends together [31]. This intervention was used in at least a dozen boys, all with excellent results, or so it was reported. It is not known how long the infibulation was maintained. Yellowlees only admitted to having removed the wire from one boy because of irritation. He was impressed by the ‚Äòconscience‚Äêstricken way in which the patients submitted to the operation upon their penises‚Äô and hoped to ‚Äòtry it on a large scale and go on wiring all masturbators.‚Äô[31] This report earned a favourable reception in the North America, where it was reprinted in the leading journals [32, 33].

Note that last line. It became a practice advocated in leading medical journals.

2020-10-03 05:14:53,Double standards for sharing experiences,"I recently wrote on my personal page about how I was tired about being objectified by women. Society/many women think it‚Äôs okay to completely disregard the feelings of men, treat us like walking ATM‚Äôs, then the moment we don‚Äôt satisfy them in EVERY way, those women will label men as abusive and try every dehumanization tactic in the book; only to immediately be cuddled by every other woman and simp out there. 

Of course, when I shared my experiences, women immediately began flooding me with messages calling me an a-hole/unfollowing. The claim is that I‚Äôm being a sexist and labeling off one singular experience. 

The fact of the matter is, this wasn‚Äôt a singular experience, but what I, and many other men experience throughout their lifetimes. We get told our feelings don‚Äôt matter, to tough it out, and if we don‚Äôt, we just get labeled as lazy losers. 

Yet, when a woman shares her negative experiences, it‚Äôs nowadays followed up by thousands of upvotes, women mindlessly validating each other, and the simps trying to get her attention. 

I‚Äôm an equal rights advocate, as the rights of women still have to be fought for in many parts of the world such as the Middle East. However, the way men get treated in the US is absolutely atrocious. 

Watching women get thousands of likes/upvotes for being overweight, yet watching overweight men get dehumanized and labeled losers has been mind boggling. 

Do people not see the clear disparities and contradictions in gender politics?

2020-10-03 07:16:00,There is literally no way you could guarentee that you are not raping someone when having sex,"[What is Consent?](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/relationships/sexual-consent)

[7 Things That Qualify as Rape](https://www.bustle.com/articles/141289-7-things-that-can-be-rape-even-if-you-were-taught-to-think-that-they-cant)

[Written Consent or Apps doesn't Work](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51448445)

The funny thing is, the video that was included in the first articles in [1:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL3xP1jlf1jgJRkChwVOlwQcV0-UqcWiFV&amp;v=qNN3nAevQKY&amp;feature=emb_logo) says something completely contradict to what the articles says  &gt;!Specific. Saying yes to one thing (like going to the bedroom to make out) doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôve said yes to others (like having sex).!&lt; 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; If you've consented to having sex with someone, and then you change your mind in the middle of the act, your partner legally has to respect that you've withdrawn your consent.   
&gt;  
&gt; A partner's total silence, does not constitute consent. 

Which means when you are in the middle of sex you have to mind read your partner every second, since if they change their mind in middle of it and **keep it silence**, they could always charge you of rape just because at **a certain point of time** they are not feeling comfortable or they just regret it afterwards, without any proof other then making emotional expression of course, the burden of proof always fall to the accused.

The video suggest you read their body language or other expression, but the problem is people have different interpretation of expression, not to mention there is alot of instance where the ""Victim"" in question choose to hide their expression or even fake it to make you believe they are happy (There could be alot of reason for it, some people are embarrassed to express discomfort, while other just does not want to hurt partner's feelings, any reason is possible).

Maybe this is how alot of rape cases was convicted. Who in the right mind made these theories? And the legal system actually standardized it.

I guess to guarentee to not put yourself in this situation is to not be the active side of person when having sex (meaing not moving at all and let your partner do it), but again, the accuser could still use the arguement of ""[Compliance](https://www.salon.com/2020/01/15/weinstein-jurors-must-differentiate-between-consent-and-compliancewhich-research-shows-isnt-easy-partner/)"" or "" Coerced"".

Well, you guess maybe not having sex at all and avoid contact with people will make you safe of rape charge, but you could still be falsely accused of sexual harassment or sexual assault in workplace, school or any other public places, and the same mindset and logic also apply to these cases, which you have to be a mind reader first, and bear the burden of guilty until proven innocent when accused.

And even if all that doesn't happen, you will still being shamed as [Coward](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/opinion-men-me-too-workplace-harassment-code_n_5c0ae9eae4b035a7bf5b2060) for protecting your rights.",1.0,1.0,1.0,38.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j455dg/there_is_literally_no_way_you_could_guarentee/,Starforce2005

Recently I have been watching this sub again because I stumbled across it, its the exact same stuff I used to concern myself with and worry about 5 years ago, Just make sure that this sub is healthy for you mentally, I know its easy to get sucked into, however alot of the issues discussed here are not going to affect you in everyday life and they dont deserve room in your head

Of course, certain topics must be talked about, male suicide rates for example, but in my opinion, just like twitter and politics this sub is cancerous for your mental health, and should be avoided, not read up on constantly

2020-10-03 13:19:40,I was sexually assaulted by my teacher back when I was in middle school.,"I am kinda scared to share it but I think I need to do this, I need to face my fears.. 

So we were in school , we all were pretty young.... And we had this teacher, she used to teach multiple subjects and people used to like her so much.. I don't know why but me and my friends used to dislike her because she used to make embarrassing jokes on us and she used to punish us so much for little reasons, she used to threat us that she will fail us... For some reasons she uses to treat me differently, I was a quiet kid and I was good in studies but she still always used to pick on me and that made me so scared of her 

One day she lost her flashdrive and.. Me and my friend were sitting on the first desk, the one right behind her.... And for no reasons she suspected me and my friend, she accused us that we stole her flashdrive and that she have to check for her flashdrive, she started checking our bags in front of the whole class and that was really embarrassing to me, I knew I was not guilty and I would never steal anything 
After checking our bags she took us out into a different class, it was empty and there she asked me ""what were you doing in the class during recess"" I said "" I don't like being with people so during lunchtime I like to stay in the classroom and so does my friend"" 

She then started checking our clothes, she told us to take our shoes off, she still didn't find her USB, she told my friend to go back to the class, I told her ""can I go back to the class now?, I really didn't steal your flashdrive"" 
She said that she have to check, I hesitated but she started checking my body.. Like touching my underarms and my pocket.. Like that.. Back then I didn't knew that it was a sexual assault cuz I didn't even knew what sex was, my parents never gave me sex education and I had no phone or Internet, 

I was so embarrassed I was about to cry, she then said that I might be hiding it in my underwear (that's where THIS was actually an assault) 
I hesitated for which she said "" if you didn't steal the flashdrive so why are you hesitating? And also you're a boy not a girl so why are you getting embarrassed?"" 
She slipped her hands in my pants and for reasons.. I got an erection even though I really disliked all that, her hands got touched all over there, she looked at me and it was so embarrassing to me, she took her hand out and said "" I'm sorry but it's good that now I checked and I'm assured that it's not you"" 

I went back to class somehow holding my tears and my friend was cussing at her and after a period everything got normal as if everyone forgot even my friend... As if nothing happend and then recess happend, the days kept on passing by the teacher was still there I never told anyone about her because I was scared she might fail me I never complained to my parents about her because the little me was afraid of my parents visiting the school because back then I didn't made notebooks 

She was in her 40s, as I grew up our teachers changed and my fear started disappearing,
I finally started learning more and more about sex from my new friends, i told my friends after that incident and they laughed they said ""tell her to suck your dick"".. I was like ""ewww"" 

And then after sometime I started getting lonely again, loosing friends because It was really hard for me to get friends 

And I changed my schools, now I'm 18 and I am well educated in that topic and sometimes I feel disgusted at myself knowing the person who touched me there for the first time was that old lady who used to treat me so bad, I sometimes feel weak because I couldn't stand up for myself and by the time i learnt about sexual assault It was too late 

I stopped telling people about that incident because everyone either laughed at me, said ""ewww"" or didn't believed me 

But now that I'm in this sub I can actually share this, I know even if I would have complained about her no action would have taken against her instead she might have accused ME for doing that and as you all know that everyone believes women and in my country people don't believe male victims at all. 

This was a very uncomfortable, uneasy and scary experience, nowdays I get a lot of flashbacks of some traumatic past experiences. 

Just sharing this to let people know that we boys get sexually assaulted as well and our issue is that people don't acknowledge us and laugh at us. 

If you are still reading this then thank you very much ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è I have no friends but I'm glad I got this sub backing me up 

Few months ago I shared my experience of me being falsely accused, now I have shared this one , I'm gonna share all the experiences which brought me to this sub and made me acknowledge men's right movement.

Feminists create women's groups in every corner. lawyers, journalists, entrepreneurs etc .. and they push for **preferential treatment for women** in all areas of life. This is really scary, not only colleges have special programs for women's issues but even big banks have special programs to fund women's education and business .. but nothing similar for men. All governments around the world created special agency and department for women's education, health, employment etc .. but **nothing similar for men** !

In the US (the same thing exist in other countries) for example they have small business funding .. but only if you are a woman !

On the other hand we have Jordan Peterson telling men to avoid identity politics and be ""just individuals"" ! 

Well, that's the ideal. to treat all prople as individuals and ignore their gender. but we are not in an ideal world. you are not ""just individuals"" ! you are a **MAN** ! if we don't strengthen the sense of identity in men and boys and create men's groups like feminists do we will be crushed even more.

Do you need funding for your business ? internship ? it will be harder to get. why ? because you are a man. yes you are a man not ""just individual"" ! 

The answer to female identity poilitics is male identity politics to create a balance. And when i say ""identity politics"" i'm talking about hating women and blaming them for all the problems no no no what i mean is creating groups to monitor the bias against men in every areas and **advocate for male friendly and egalitarian policy**.

&amp;#x200B;

This quote explain it very well:

&gt; ‚ÄúIdeally there should not be a men's movement but a gender transition movement; only the power of the women's movement necessitates the temporary corrective of a men's movement.‚Äù

2020-10-03 18:29:38,My opinion about feminism,"Funny how feminists think feminism is all about having sex outside marriage, smoking cigarettes because it's ""your choice"" but if a man does it it's toxic masculinity. You want equal pay, but want a guy who earns more than you, you complain that you won't find a good guy but at the same time rejected a 5'9 good guy for a 6'1 trash guy when you're 5'3 yourself. But when men want a girl who's not fat, it's fat shaming. You teach girls to slap men in public and when a girl really does it, she's a hero but when a man slaps her back, it's an assault  and he's a misogynist.

We live in a society where saying ""all men are trash"" is cool, but ""all women are trash"" is offensive and misogyny. When a man rapes a woman, it's a rape but when a woman rapes a man, it's a favor. Laws are gender biased.

So, given the fact that not all anti-feminists hate women, it is wrong to generalize all anti-feminists as being sexist.  Anti-feminists could be your family doctor, your friendly neighbor, or even your spouse.  It would make society much better for everyone if people accepted anti-feminism as the valid, non-hateful philosophy that it is instead of unfairly demonizing anti-feminists as being bad people.

2020-10-04 20:11:41,Justifications for feminism are totalitarian in nature,"Kalitz, 2011 ""Classifying political regimes""

""There are two ‚Äústrong‚Äù ways rulers justify why the people should obey them: by the claim that they have a God-given natural, historical or religious right to rule or that they have a God-given natural, historical or religious purpose to rule; or by procedures that guarantee that the people are able to select and control the rulers themselves. There are only two regime types ‚Äì communist ideocracy and (traditional) monarchy ‚Äì in which justification relies on a God-given natural/historical law outside the political regime. This is a very strong legitimation, with a clear plan of how society should be structured. Communist regimes and monarchies therefore establish a fixed ruling class ‚Äì the communist party elite or the aristocracy ‚Äì which are united by a strong fear that they would dramatically lose their privileges following a regime change.
In stark contrast to these ideal regime types, citizens in a liberal democracy are asked to recognize the right of public authority to issue commands, because they have participated in the process wherein those commands originated.""

You may notice that eventually when debating with feminists they justify their power structures and their legitimacy by appeals to ""History"" akin to how communist regimes did. It is this appeal to patriarchy theory that they claim legitimacy for their actions and rule that forms the basis of their worldview.

We can see how this results in a hierarchical relationship between women and men when put into practice and the amount of unequal treatments it is used to justify. This is because the fundamental structure of feminist theory and feminist power structures are not inclusive as they rest their claims for legitimacy of their actions on ""history"", not ""participation."". 

This is partly because feminism cannot hope to rest it's claims on participation as men would not agree to their own subjugation for womens benefit.

When you see feminists pull ""History"" as a justification for present day inequalities they are imposing, you should bare this dynamic in mind.",1.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j4xyl2/justifications_for_feminism_are_totalitarian_in/,azazelcrowley

2020-10-04 23:09:47,Girls started a ‚Äúgirls-only‚Äù high school club to compete with mine,"Throwaway account so I don‚Äôt get expelled for criticizing feminism.

Background: I‚Äôm a senior in a Christian high school and run a coding club. A few girls who always seem out to get me made a club that is in violation of school rules, yet has been approved.

The Christian school I go to is not what you‚Äôd expect from most religious private schools in America. Politically, it is heavily left-wing on social issues. Not that that‚Äôs a bad thing, but it ticks me off that the teachers cannot remain politically neutral. Their identity politics almost certainly influenced their decision here.

School rules state that clubs must be ‚Äúinclusive of everybody‚Äù. My club was always the one open to everybody, it‚Äôs just that no girls wanted to join. As an asian male who wants to study computer science, my demographic constantly gets threatened by affirmative action so much it‚Äôs like they are trying to actively hurt interest from people like me, giving every fucking opportunity to girls or other minorities purely based on their gender.

No other club in the school has to face this bs like I have to right now. If you were running any other club you wouldn‚Äôt get a group of teachers and students supporting a breakaway faction of students.

The fact of the matter is, two of three girls running the club actually have no coding experience. They‚Äôre snakes who simply are out to try and qualify for some affirmative action-based STEM scholarship. If you wanted to take control of a club in the school, the precedent is that you are chosen by the outgoing leader of that club if he or she has graduated. None of the three were ever in my club before I took leadership, although one of the snakes joined my club last year, presumably to see how things worked. 

If I made a boys only club, the shit would‚Äôve hit the fucking fan by now. The thing is, I don‚Äôt want to make it boys only, I want access to 100% of the students, not the 50% they are forcing me into.

It‚Äôs against the rules, it‚Äôs against my interests and my clubs‚Äô interests, yet it‚Äôs all set up because of the blatant feminist activism that happens in my future field. Fuck the ‚Äúunderrepresentation‚Äù argument that they make, it‚Äôs all an elaborate sham to steal good paying jobs from people like me in STEM.

I can‚Äôt allow them to win, and seeing this blatant hypocrisy makes me sick. What do I do?

TL:DR: Girls only club run by disingenuous snakes that breaks school rules is allowed and directly hurts my club.",1.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j50fnn/girls_started_a_girlsonly_high_school_club_to/,jm019

Yes, many times. When I was 12 and he was 9 was the first time I saw it. Everytime he did something wrong, my mother would make him bend over and beat his butt. She would also make sure that I watched. However, before I was 12, she would never spank him in front of me. I would watch and get glimpses of his penis. Then mother would make him stand nude in a corner. I would watch his penis and I might have actually enjoyed it. I started lying to mother, and she would believe me because she thought older girls never lie. She would again spank and make him stand in a corner naked, while I watched. When I became 13 and he 10, I would invite my female friends to watch as they also never saw a penis before. Me and my friends watched him get spanked and we enjoyed it. My mother would also make him apologize to us with his penis facing us. Almost all my friends had seen his penis and balls at least once. Once, when he was in the corner, me and my friends started changing into our bikinis in front if him and he wasn't able to control it. When he got an erection, me and my friends would make fun and shake it around. Then when we pointed it out to mother, she would beat his penis with a rolling pin until it went down. Once we tied him up to the bed nude and experimented on him. We dropped things like a basketball, bat, even scissors on his penis. He would often cry. Then we told our mother and this time, she locked him outside the house nude. A lot of men, women, boys and girls younger than him came by and some would stare and some even took pictures of him. We would force him to stop covering himself and allow the strangers and girls to see his penis.

     Thank you all for the support that you have given in my last post, but I wanted to clarify that I did not voice my concerns in the best way. 

     While I know that there were some specific issues within the GIANT company, I feel that I voiced my concerns in an overly generalized way. It is not fair to the other hard working and respectful female workers and supervisors of the company for me to group then all in a category as sexist.

     I am sorry for making more generalized claims when the reality was that much more specific issues with specific people.
     Obviously, I would not put peoples' names out there for revenge or anything like that at all. I mainly meant to respectfully speak my mind and vent a little without some stresses, but instead I tried to fight some instances of sexism with more sexism and I am sorry for that.

At first I thought it was just a joke. The title reads like satire. But then you read the article, and this is the first line '' Men are more likely to buy eco-friendly products and donate to environmental charities if the branding strokes their fragile masculine egos ''

And this is a mainstream article.....open to children, teenagers, all impressionable. And this is the stuff that they're reading growing up.

Now imagine if a man had written an article similar to this, and stereotyped, degraded women in it. Like women are more likely to buy a car if it has stupid girly patterns on it, because they're more preoccupied with the aesthetics of a car than its horsepower.

And used emotive, subjective terms like '' fragile masculine egos ''.

There are people who write articles like that (on the opposite wing), and they are instantly considered as underground and shunned away from mainstream media. But why is it that talking sh\*t against men is considered appropriate?

I don't see anything wrong with the article. It says that men are more likely to purchase something if the product exudes toughness or masculinity. I thought that was obvious? Lol. Why is that a wrong thing? Why is it wrong to be macho?",1.0,1.0,1.0,30.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j5fw94/why_is_misandry_so_mainstream_do_you_think_its/,DynamicCrab

2020-10-05 19:10:27,"Men's rights charter for India (discussion, activism)","Men's rights charter

In all relevant posts about India, I keep commenting my 5 demands for the Indian law, in hopes that those who see it may think about it, do some research, and if they agree with it, demand it from their representatives- MLAs, MLCs, MPs or whoever. I want to consolidate and may be plug in some addenda to it. I will keep updating it as I find more misandric laws. And I will use this post in the comments, hereon.

This charter is intended to compensate for and neutralise certain laws/ penalties in the Indian constitution/ penal code, which are either unfairly advantageous to women or unfairly disadvantageous to men.

1. The definition of rape: IPC section 375

By Indian law, a woman cannot commit rape, even if she indulges in non-consensual sex with a man (drugged or unconscious), sex under threat, or sex with a minor male. This gives extreme immunity to women, and literally ignores the men affected.

The code should be amended to include men as victims and women as perpetrators, and include encapsulation of penis (as opposed to penetration by penis) in the sexual act. This should make the rape law gender-neutral.

There were attempts in 2012 and 2018 to make the rape laws gender neutral (and replace the term with 'sexual assault'), but the feminist lobby pressured the politicians against gender-neutrality in favour of 'gender-justice' and 'gender-sensitive' laws.

2. Penalty for false accusations

The penalty for false accusations is nearly non-existent. This subsidises fake allegations. While the accused might get anywhere between the legal fees to fines to many years in jail as punishment, the false accuser goes Scot-free. This sets a bad example. The penalty for false accusations should be just as severe as the penalty for the corresponding crime. False rape accusation should be penalised the same as a rape conviction, false sexual harassment accusation should be penalised the same as the punishment for sexual harassment.

3. IPC section 354

* The definition of modesty is in itself vague. Does it mean dress, behaviour, language? The criminal code also specifies that only the modesty of a woman has provision for protection. Why? Can men not be modest? Or is male modesty worthless or not worth protecting? The law must either be scrapped or changed to include protection of men and male modesty.
* Section 354-A protects women from sexual harassment, but even these laws are written with the male as the perpetrator. Physical contact, unwelcome advances, demand for sexual favours, showing pornography against the will of a woman (?!), sexual remarks are all punishable only if perpetrated by men. If a woman does any of these, she's unquestionable. There's not a mention of women as potential perpetrators.
* Section 354-B protects women from men from disrobing a woman. This is utterly ridiculous because there's no mention of any punishment with the genders reversed, or if a woman disrobes herself in similar circumstances. If a woman disrobes herself as an act of protest or whatever, or disrobes another woman, what's the penalty? What's the punishment for a woman who disrobes herself in front of other non-consenting people, and puts them through sexual/ visual trauma?
* Section 354-C protects women against voyeurism. Again, protects only the women, against only the men. Go figure.
* Section 354-D protects women only against stalking by men only.
* Section 354 needs a complete gender-neutral makeover.

4. Domestic cruelty: Section 498-A

Gendered law. Protects women from their husbands and in-laws, but not husbands from their in-laws It also includes any act that drives a woman to suicide. If a husband commits suicide because of the wife, India doesn't care. It needs to be made gender neutral.

5. National Commission for Men: Just like there is a National Commission for Women, that comes to the aid of the women when they face any crime, there should be established a statutory body, National Commission for Men fo help men when they face sexual or gendered crimes.

6. Ministry for Men: Just like the Ministry for Women and Child development (Yes, the Indian law recognises and provides a ministry for women and children, but not men), there should be a Ministry for Men looking after the interests of the male citizens.

* State-funding for female-only scholarships, employment opportunities, grants, subsidies and other monetary benefits should be opposed/ cancelled or matched by the Ministry for Men.
* Inheritance rights for men should be revised.
* Special reservations/ concessions for women (in state-funded transport, etc.) should be abolished. 

7. Women's police stations and women's courts are a disgrace to any country that doesn't want to be misandric. They should be abolished.

8. The arrest of women is a disaster (Criminal Procedure Amendment 2005). Women can't be arrested between 6 pm &amp; 6 am, can be arrested only by a female police officer, or with a female police officer on duty at the time of arrest, and be taken to an all-women police station and be put in a women-only cell (this one is reasonable). None of these provisions are available to men. Why? Is there no trust in law enforcement agencies? If such an apprehension is placed on male police officers, then a similar argument can be made that men don't feel safe in the presence of female police officers. This is an unnecessarily gendered law, and should either be thrown out, or made gender-neutral.

9. Alimony must be made gender-neutral (bidirectional), temporary (limited to a maximum of the duration of the marriage, and stops as soon as the recipient enters a relationship) and restricted (limited to half the difference of income of the 2 persons).

10. The legal age of marriage (Special Marriage Act of 1954) should be made equal for both men and women (be it 18 or 21). If a man is legally mature enough to vote and choose their representative for their state/ nation at age 18, why is he considered immature to decide on his own marriage?

&amp;#x200B;

This is the charter v1.0. And this will be updated or reposted with addenda periodically. If you're aware of other legal inequalities in India, DM me. Please use it well.",1.0,1.0,1.0,20.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j5hhbu/mens_rights_charter_for_india_discussion_activism/,Lion_amongst_gods

We are being taught that men enjoy this, that men enjoy seeing violence and
murdering people.

2020-10-05 23:49:45,The official italian facebook page for MRA is actively ruining the image of what you guys are trying to do and I need help,"I write this in frustration, after an exchange I had with ""Diritti Maschili"", the official facebook page for the movement in Italy. They have written a lengthy thread where they list all the issues men face and how women can help solve them. Most of them are perfectly reasoneable, except for one, which to me seems to have absolutely nothing to do with upholding men's right.

It's going to be difficult to show you the post, because it's in italian. I am going to provide a link and you can translate what they wrote to make sure I am not making things up.

[Here](https://imgur.com/S8jl219) is the link.

The TLDR is that a woman who chooses their partner based on their physical appearance is sexist. They advocate that unattractive men should still be able to date women, and that women should educate their daugthers to ignore physical appearances and only focus on their internal values, character and personality.

To which I replied with [this](https://imgur.com/u7w8Ysy). You can see my real name, and I don't care. What I said was that there is nothing sexist about wanting to have an attractive person as your partner, and that this has nothing to do with defending men's right. Their response was nothing short of absurd.

To summarize what they said, they told me that I am ugly (""bruttino in viso"") and that women would never date me because of that. This apparently is an injustice against me, because this prevents me from showing a woman how beautiful I am on the inside. He continues, saying that men don't select based on physical appearances because men are more alone than women. And finally, they said that **female loneliness does not exist, and can only be attributed to women being too picky**.

This is fucking bullshit. And also the reason why people hold negative opinions towards the movement: any logical issue we could try to raise gets drowned by these pointless and offensive arguments.

Finally, he says that I am sabotaging the page and that I am free to leave. As a response, he deletes my comment and then all the comments I write further to ask why he deleted it.

Please. Don't tell me this is what MRA believes in. Do you believe that women cannot be lonely? To me this is incredibly sexist and absurd. We should focus on shit that matters: inequality in funding for prostrate cancer, unfair divorce procedures, asymmetrical suicide rates.

If someone I know puts together who made this post I'm sure my life is ruined. Didn't originally plan to post this here, but everywhere else bans this post and... I'm sure you'll enjoy elements of this. Not really looking for advice. That said, please love me... the way only strangers with masks are capable of loving each other. 

# The Setup

We begin our tale in fair Verona, where a potentially uncountable number of star-crossed lovers lie.

My wife and I have been together for 11 years, starting when we were 19. She was married for a year before me but got out because it was childish and he was physically abusive. We got married 5 years ago. Had our son 3.5 years ago. She's a nurse. I've worked a smattering of who cares jobs throughout my 20s until my son came along, and since then I've been a stay-at-home dad and engineering major undergrad (top of my class). She's an extrovert and needs lots of social intercourse, I'm an introvert and maybe undiagnosed and on the spectrum (but our relationship has been magical all these years because she gave me a chance that few would, and we've both changed each other for the better). She's always had a relatively common substance-abuse dependency that I participate in, but I do keep her in check more than she might admit.

# Round I

When we were engaged and it was within a year of the wedding, I already knew she was bisexual, and she had this old bisexual girlfriend who had her own boyfriend. She told me they were interested in a 3-way. Immediately I had fantasies about a greater sense of confidence that would come from nailing two hot lesbians. But then she was like... No she's not into you that way. I want this to be about pleasuring me. Then the other girl's boyfriend (older guy) overheard somehow and took me aside. I was fucking horrified but he wasn't mad at all. He was basically like... Dude they playin' ya. What you gonna get out of a 2.5-way. I chuckle about that to myself sometimes still.

Anyway I said no, don't do that, I can't handle it. A while later she came home intoxicated and was like dude I fucked her. I just got caught up in the moment. I don't love you any less, but a girl really knows how to get a girl off. Which made me wonder because I'd gotten her off a lot of times over the years through sheer practice. I was irritated.

After a while I felt she had grown unusually abrasive with me over strange things. I dug up an anonymous social media account I had helped her create years prior for god knows what reason, and found a post a few weeks before our wedding she had made about her substance abuse and how every times she's out on the town without me she feels horrible but ends up making out with random dudes. 

I cried. I felt sick. I confronted her and she got upset that I kept badgering her about it. Eventually we both got over it but I never knew how bad she really felt. Like if it was fear/anxiety of confronting her own guilt or her actual guilt.

We got married and the wedding was beautiful.

# Round II

I had a shitty job and was away long hours every day of the week not long after the wedding. At one of her work parties she came up to me and said... OMG my coworker John just kissed me. Out of nowhere. 

I balled up my fists, fantasizing about starting my own prison gang after getting locked up, and walked up the guy. ""Do you have anything to say to me?"" Literally while walking away he was like ""what are you talking..."" And his voice trailed off. 

Fast forward a few months. Sat down and randomly watched a documentary with my wife about websites and apps cheaters use and how the business fosters the destruction of families. ""Whaaack"", she said and fell asleep. The god of snoopy paranoiacs possessed me randomly. I snooped through her phone. Extensive message history going back to work party with John. I mean he is a handsome guy, but I always felt he'd look better drawn and quartered. It became an emotional affair and they had kept having make out sessions. I immediately went out and met John's wife Margaret at a Tim Horton's. 

Nice lady. Flew into a rage when she read the messages. I gave her copies. Use your imagination. 

John's marriage became a living nightmare (24 years and 5 kids). Mine did too. She just said it's hard with you being away and I got carried away because of all the time we spend together at the soup kitchen. Insisted he's a romantic guy, but the risk-taking and occasional pushiness left her uncomfortable. She was broken up about it. Didn't wanna divorce. Promised to stop. Convinced me to sell the collapsible guillotine I'd bought off Alibaba. Turns out they depreciate in value really quickly, even without blood spatters.

# Round III

I know, the fast forward button is getting worn out. So are my bitch ass out-of-warranty tear ducts. It was less than a year later.

She was intoxicated a lot. Told me she had grown to hate John. He never stopped badgering her and always still tried to get her to fuck him (still?). She felt obligated to try to fix their marriage. A wife couldn't love an unconfident husband. A younger pretty girl flirting with an older salt and pepper type would surely make him feel more confident as long as it was harmless. She said she let him write her love letters on company letter stock just to see how far he'd go and if she could get him to change. Before she passed out, she swore I'd never find the letters she kept. 

I found them in a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow a minute later. I quickly burned them without reading them. Just kidding, I'm not retarded. I took pictures of all of them and put them back, and spent a few days reading them while fetishizing and masturbating to my own lack of mental health. 

The affair never stopped. They kept sneaking around on lunch breaks and making out in the back of his geo metro. Quickly went to John's wife Matilda at our usual spot at the Cliffs of Moher and gave her photos. ""It's over."" \#LorenaBobbittVibes 

My wife was mad. Snoopy wasn't married for a reason, genius. Now I'm the home wrecker. Don't I care about their kids? People lose their jobs over this kinda stuff! But do we really love each other? If we are gonna make it I have to stop driving her into the arms of another man. Around this time my growing knowledge of infidelity tropes landed me a 7-figure deal with Harlequin publishers. 

Eventually the roller coaster of emotions came to a standstill, she gave me a heartfelt confession (after I demanded full disclosure along with an intimidating threat that I would never leave her or divorce her or stop loving her) that she had seen his dick (\#Enormous) but they hadn't had sex. He'd wanted a handjob and sex but she'd refused because that was a thicc line you didn't cross. Instead he'd gotten her off with his hand. She felt horrible. Why did he always want sex, time after time. She just wanted an emotional connection. She felt unworthy of me (you and I both know deep down it was the other way around tho, don't deny it). She was sorry, and desperate to make it. She promised to cut him off. She even met up with his wife Maxine and instead of murdering each other shared a few drinks at the soda fountain and agreed that John was a tool of mammoth proportions, because he never admitted anything beyond what was provable with documentary evidence (unlike my wife) and even blamed my wife for everything.

We moved on with our lives. 

# Round IV

Less than a blue moon later she conceived our son. I named him Bartholomew. The lead up was interesting. 

Really felt like we were progressing. The lead up to her conception was actually magical. I had started watching porn since the incident despite the uptick in the hotness and frequency of our sex life. Even tho I'm not the beating off in the corner type, I thought maybe I could learn a thing or two from the pros. Dunno how much I learned really (other than it sure seems like an awful lot of fun to have sex with a squealing piece of plastic) because I didn't try out anything new. And I ended up stopping porn because I quickly started having moments where I'd fantasize about her fucking John. That was strangely erotic but obviously an alarm bell that I might be on my way to the loony bin. 

She literally would not stop fucking me, day and night. My dick was raw and eyes were tired from staying up having sex all night. To make it (past misdeeds) up to me she took me to a strip club too (never been), and got me a lap dance (she sat in because she's bi) with this impossibly beautiful skinny blonde with tits that made me want to cry. The stripper let me suck on her boobs and started rubbing my crotch and that's when my wife cut it off. I still fantasize about taking that stripper home with my wife. 

Even tho we use pretty old-fashioned contraceptive methods, in the thousands of times my wife and I had had sex over the years she'd never gotten pregnant. Eventually it came to the point where she was like we are doing fine financially and honestly I want to give you children (although she put it in more graphic sexual terms). She immediately got pregnant when we started trying. 

Anyway she had a great pregnancy and when my son was born I knew it was mine because then and until now, the kid is an actual creepy spit n image of my own infant/childhood pictures and behaviors. 

After her maternity leave was over, because she had a better job than me down at the court house, we agreed I'd quit my job at the shit factory and stay home with my son Bruce. I'm still a stay-at-home father years later, and an excellent student of medicine. She grew to like her job more and more.

She told me frankly that John had started flirting with her again, and that more than once she's deleted a draft email to HR about his sexual harassments. Everytime he said something she'd come home and tell me. Also told him she told me everything which made him so angry he burned down a small village. She told me he would shut down every time she'd tell him to tell his wife they still talked. She hated that he'd flirt with her on symbolic dates like his wife's birthday or anniversary.

She came home one day with a broken nose. Told me she had jammed it in the copier at work by accident. I believed her. A day later she admitted that John had taken her horse-back riding with his horses and she'd fallen off and broken it. \#tears. Please don't leave me. I said it's fine I believe her. I was mad that he'd been careless enough to get her hurt by putting her on his biggest stallion. No biggie tho, her nose is fine. 

A year later (recent past) they had to go on a work trip together to build two hospitals in two small Haitian villages. It was just a day trip and despite my warnings she rode in his ford fiesta instead of her own SUV. 

A month later she's at different employer and intoxicated late at night and breaks down in unprovoked tears I hadn't seen in YEARS. Says she fucked John. 

# Denouement 

I quick ran to the bathroom to jerk one out at the thought of that surely momentous erotic experience. When I came back, she says he did wear a condom and didn't even come. She just laid there. It was in the back of his dodge neon in a public park on lunch break. She was mad actually because she had pleaded no multiple times when they started making out earlier. Eventually she was like fine just get it over with. She said just divorce me, I'm not worth it. I betrayed you. 

I was like Marcus Fucking Aurelius. Totally chill. Said I don't blame her. I'm a dude. We're thirsty, and I know the guy was badgering you for years. Actually, it could be rape considering she said no, and she didn't deny it. She confirmed, said he had made a secret whatsapp to communicate and had started pressuring her. I asked but didn't pressure to see them and she was like nah it's not worth it. 

I was chill outwardly, but actually being cucked makes you ruminate on a lot of existential questions. The next few days were hell even tho we didn't argue, although she admitted there were things about me that often angered her and probably drove her somewhat. I snooped and read 2 out of the 60 whatsapp messages and she mentioned liking being on top and he liked the being on top too but let her do it because it made her happy. I found some videos on Vimeo about affair therapy that made me feel better. Asked her to do them. She declined after a nanosecond because it made her feel like more of a bad guy than she really is. I said fine. 

I started talking about an open relationship. She said no I hate him. He's a manipulative ass hole. I'm ending it. I stopped portraying him as Darth Sidious and said look... You and the guy have a relationship. Doesn't mean you love your spouses any less. We can love multiple people. She agreed. I said you could even find someone else. Also, didn't it feel good to talk openly? Like she had been about these details all along with her friends?

She was warmed up and admitted more details. The week before the horse nose incident she'd sucked his dick. And other than jacking him off regularly during their original affair years ago (that part was news to me, but I didn't let on that it was) she hadn't done anything else sexual. Said she had been making out with him since the WhatsApp started but that's it prior to their sexual incident. I said well hey keep going. I won't tell Medusa, and you have my blessing. Just love him, and always keep our family first. Won't being free of the shadow of guilt make you feel better? By the way, did you like being on bottom at all even? She said yes. Or were you on top? Oh... I was actually. Did I tell you that when I was intoxicated. Yes, yes you did.

That night she set me up with a tinder account so I could have my own fling with her blessing. She wouldn't let me have her full blessing tho. Her way of developing a relationship just happened, she didn't seek it out, and it was more than just sex. Like 99% emotional value and a smidge of sex. Couldn't really endorse me dating girls as a stay at home dad when I didn't work and anyway I'd fall in love with a young hottie and stop loving her. The irony of that double standard is shirley not lost on those versed in evolutionary psychology. She said she'd let me have my ""revenge affair"" though.

Stayed up all night swiping right on hotties and notties. Made me sick. Eventually deleted my account and messaged john's wife Madeline to meet me at the village of bree at first light. When I went to bed my wife said, open relationship is a no go. I agreed.

I met up with her next day and told her the long form narrative of what she didn't know. Disgusted and calling divorce attorney and fantasizing about fat settlement. I cried. Admitted I'd stopped eating, sleeping. I lost 15 lbs in a week. Still haven't been able to eat. I'm sick. 

It was catharsis. I ended the dudes marriage. Like 99% chance. Told my wife, she was mad. I had a macho moment. Basically told her to get over it, she's in the wrong, I still own her though, and we are doing monogamy my way because she sucks at it. It was fun to pretend to be an alpha male for a moment. She instantly said we are done talking at all until we see a therapist or she divorces me. \#NowSheWantsTherapy

After a few hours of cold shoulder, she thanked me for ending a dark period of her life. Wants to stick it out. When it all blew, he tried to get her to say she'd taken hallucinogens when she admitted that stuff and it's all a fever dream. And I know how he feels. People often make up fake graphic sexual affairs in order to save their marriage. It's lunacy of course and even she had to laugh at that. Still mad at me for going to his wife without telling her, but somebody had to do it. 

I've omitted even more shocking details of our life because this has to stay anonymous. Also I bet the two people who actually read this are probably going to need corrective lenses now. 

This is all pretty fresh. There are ups and downs. I can't destroy our family though. I've never seen my real parents in the same room together. I'm not doing that to my son Bartimus. I just want her to love me, not leave me, stay monogamous. I wanna fix her the way she tried to fix John. I wanna stop crying. I'm crying right now writing this, and my stomach hurts because I can't eat. I'm exhausted from not sleeping. I know if she leaves me I'll never find anyone as gorgeous or smart as my wife who will love me. I'm worried I'm gonna fail.

2020-10-06 05:14:01,"I haven't posted in a while about men's rights, cause I fear.","I fear we have been outnumbered, there are tons of feminists and there is always one lurking nearby. All of the hysteria and lies they spread impact me and many of us a lot. Though one MRA can dismantle a dozen feminist's feelings with facts, I find it exhausting to repeat them. I hate remembering every study, articles or government offical quotes to back everything up. All the negativity from them has changed me. I have been to obsessed with debunking them, that I have trouble with being with my fiance√©, we rarely talk cause of this issue. I also develop a brain Tumour around my substantia nigra, which gave me parkinson's disease, I'd like to point my finger at stress, but I've tolerated so much of it, It's hard to feel human. Also cause of it, my ankylosing spondylitis is more painful. 

All of this, for being a pariah for supporting men and going against an unethical label. In my department in the hospital, I was visited from HR, they said some of the feminists working near me complained about my beliefs and debates I have both inside and outside the hospital. I was told to reduce my voice and beliefs otherwise the complaints will pile over my career. 

I fear for people being blind to reality, with all the opposition not in reality, they deny the facts, which makes me more scared for myself and others. They are cancer, one becomes delusional and violent, and others join in with this movement. They out numbered us dramatically, and I fear they will harm men more than they already have. I fear for not being to speak up. And my gender becoming thin air. 


I do not know if this post is bad, cringe, stupid or makes me a wuss. But I am in fear cause I am a man, and I support my fellow brothers. I fear I'll loose my fiance√©, career, health and reputation all cause of that. I fear I might surrender.

2020-10-06 09:04:54,The Gillette Strategy,"Buy-ology, by Martin Lindstrom, is a 2008 book about advertising based on experiments with brain scans to identify how people really react to advertising stimuli. I generally recommend that people read a couple of books about advertising just to be aware of how we are constantly being manipulated by well-backed highly researched advertising tricks that, most of the time, work beneath the level of consciousness.

For example, have you ever noticed how common it is for bakeries/doughnut stores to be positioned just in front of supermarkets in shopping malls. The idea is that the smell of baking will cause shoppers to buy more food after entering the supermarket. This has partly been replaced by the use of aerosols to create the same effect without the investment.

However, it's worth reading a short piece from page 191:

""Now, enter girlfriends and wives. Who do you think is buying most men their underwear?, You guessed. In fact, I would estimate that more than three-quarters of all pairs of male underwear are bought by women for men-a phenomenon known as the Gillette Strategy (referring to the widespread assumptin that 90 percent of all Gillette shavers are bought by women for the men in their lives.)

And there lies the clue as to why Gillette should think that an anti-male advert should be successful in pushing a product for men. And there lies a big part of the solution for men in general: DO NOT LET YOUR PARTNER BUY YOUR STUFF FOR YOU. You make the choice.

2020-10-06 12:02:11,I finally got the parental leave I deserve!,"Hello everyone! Late last year, my wife and I found out we were having our first baby! She and I were elated at the news! However, I decided to ask HR at my job earlier this year how the parental leave policy worked. The HR lady explained primary caregivers get 6 weeks paid, while secondary caregivers get 2 weeks paid (both are eligible for unpaid leave through FMLA). They told me since I wasn‚Äôt the one physically giving birth, I was considered secondary. To say the least, I was upset. I complained and nothing came of it.

My wife gave birth to our beautiful baby boy in July and I took my two weeks‚Äô paid leave. Returning to work was awful, as I hardly had any sleep. Good luck sleeping with a two week old baby to take care of!

Now to the other good news! I received an email Monday afternoon stating that there have been changes to the parental leave policy, amongst other changes. I asked HR if this impacted me at all. They informed me that I will be receiving 6 weeks‚Äô paid leave! This means I will be able to take off 4 weeks any time I‚Äôd like in order to help take care of my family. I can use it any time between now and March 31st (6 months).

2020-10-06 12:35:53,Earl Silverman‚Äôs story is why I cannot support Feminism.,"I‚Äôm new to the MRA space on the internet, I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I‚Äôd call myself MRA, but I just learned of the story of Earl Silverman and I cannot believe how the American media and feminist writers reacted to it. 

I‚Äôm just aghast.

If you don‚Äôt know the context, Earl Silverman was a survivor of domestic abuse who spent 20 years of his life trying to help men and boys who suffered from domestic abuse. In 2013, he committed suicide and left a note citing the lack of government funding and the disparity between funding for women‚Äôs shelters and male shelters, as well as the financial situation in ran into trying to fund his cause, as what drove him to suicide. 

Here‚Äôs a list of the main problematic articles:

[An article from the Atlantic that attempts to discredit Silverman‚Äôs cause by taking his issues out of context and strawmanning him.](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/04/earl-silverman-suicide/315761/)

[A Salon article that seeks to discredit his cause by using statistics on DV in America as opposed to stats from Canada which Silverman used in his claim (which are accurate and verified)](https://www.salon.com/2013/04/29/feminism_didnt_kill_mens_rights_advocate_earl_silverman/)

[This article cites the two above articles and is cited in the Atlantic article. The author tried to discredit Silverman and his cause after his death.](https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2013/05/14/another-men%E2%80%99s-rights-activist-suicide-exploited-ideologues#.X3vycrBit3c.twitter)

I‚Äôm not going to list out all the problems in the articles because it would be *really* long and would take away from the post. 

But as a survivor of psychological domestic abuse myself, the response from the American mainstream media is *devoid of compassion* for men. It makes me and I‚Äôm sure other survivors feel alone, maligned and frustrated because no matter what any woman goes through, she‚Äôll have plenty of government funding, shelters, and public sympathy for her.

It‚Äôs both revolting and alienating and I‚Äôm not sure who‚Äôs to blame but ourselves.",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j5yv2s/earl_silvermans_story_is_why_i_cannot_support/,kookysnoopy

2020-10-06 19:54:45,Here's a weird post: A Finnish trade-unionist squirrel said in a comedy show that we should fight the evil like racism and feminism,"It's a comedy show on TV with all kinds of bizarre characters competing with each other. Very popular.

Anyway, this year they have an all-stars season. The squirrel guy is one of the best-known comedians in the land, and he actually hosts the show, too. But he also won the game some years ago by playing this squirrel. 

So, last saturday he left the host's role and came back to the stage as the squirrel. Did some comedy and then ended by saying that we should fight the evil like violence, racism, and ... feminism. Now the backup host who had been nodding along until he mentions feminism gets alarmed and says: ""No, no, no, you can't say a thing like that, not on TV"".  The squirrel ends with one of his catch phrases: ""Yes I can because I'm so cute"".

Yeah, not funny. But meaningful. I'm certain that he decided to end the routine by saying something that is, like, the worst thing you can say on stage, something that nobody else ever says. I mean, juxtaposing racism and feminism! But he could do it because he is so cute. Had he been somebody else, somebody not doing comedy and being cute, he would have been lynched, so to speak.

I've been reading about humor and jokes lately. One of the themes I've stumbled on is the question of who you can make fun of. And, as you all know, one answer is: the powerful. But is that really the reason why feminism is beyond criticism more than any other political movement, ideology, or ... well almost anything?

2020-10-07 02:55:24,Mistakes on Custody,"So in January of 2019 papers were signed and the divorce was finalized. The custody arrangement for daughter was Dad for weekends and Mom for weekdays.

Dad didn‚Äôt have a place to live at the time because he left the 3bed house to the Mom along with the Santa Fe he was still paying for and his two dogs.

Mom and Dad had a verbal agreement that Dad could see daughter whenever he wanted, but time and time again this was proven untrue. For a while a 50/50 agreement was reached after a 2 bedroom place was acquired by dad. 3-2-2 to be exact, and all was well until Mom didn‚Äôt want to do that anymore. A new agreement was in the works but Dad could not make it to the meeting, so Mom said we were going back to the arrangement on papers until the new agreement began. It was Dads day so he went to see his daughter. Mom ignored all texts and hid from Dad during his time and then after some heated messages (Dad hinted at calling cops if paperwork was on hand) Mom took all time away from Dad except weekends.

Now Dad has been broken and distraught and wants to organize a good legal case, but the odds are stacked heavily against him because he is a male, and the paperwork is final. Bitter feelings of a past marriage are influencing Mom‚Äôs decisions and she cannot and will not see that. Dad has written her a letter explaining his choices and apologizing and begging for just 50/50 parenting, but Mom will not even work with Dad on a nap schedule and has daughter getting up at 3-4am and not napping all day.

Dad misses daughter so bad it aches and just wants her to be happy and get equal time with each side of her family, but Mom will not allow her to be with Dads family on her time, so the 2 days a week she is with Dad often involve family time.

Please, if ANYONE has advice, I feel like my heart is constantly being ripped apart and I can‚Äôt keep letting the system and a narcissistic mother control my life",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j6b2kd/mistakes_on_custody/,AviRaha

2020-10-07 09:38:57,"Massive headhunt on high school for ""harassment and rape"" allegations that lead to male students' diffamation","Ok, so this was at my high school in March (didn't knew about this subreddit up to now), a couple of weeks before the pandemic hit us at Mexico, I was at my last year back then  (now I'm on college). The thing is that during february and march there was this huge feminist movement that was not so relevant for most of the males in my highschool because they did it during our classes. Because of this, their movements were continously growing both in aggressiveness and hate towards the institution and male classmates, on top of that, they were starting to run rumors about rapists or harassers among certain classmates and most of them without any proof but just ""believe me since I'm telling the truth"".

This certain day (March 12) they did a huge meeting in the center of the school to protest until the principal showed up, only for them to insult him and demand a meeting between him and the leaders of the movement, this was when all the true madness began, instead of giving solutions to the harassment they claimed to suffer, they literally did a show where all of them could saw them, naming lots of people from a list that then became public claiming that they were all harassers and also some rapists, keep in mind that although some of them may or may have not been guilty, there were individuals that were clearly innocent, such as this one guy who was gay in secret, but was forced to say it in order to save himself from the allegations that were imposed on him. On top of this, the list was anonymous, so any girl could place a name without anyone knowing who she was, they didn't show any proof for that as well, just their word.

They continued like that unrestrained (thanks to popular media being on their side) until the pandemic hitted us and we could no longer be in the school. Some of this guys were even prosecuted as potential sex offenders in court, not sure of how things turned out for them. I was also on that list, although I don't even talk to girls except for like 5 who have been friends of mine since first semester and thankfully stood up for me and helped me keep my name clean (however, the mere fact that I was there has clearly got its consequences, reputation gets horribly affected for shit like this even if you're innocent).

I know it has been a long time since that happened, but I thought it was woth of pointing out for this subreddit since it clearly shows the type of injustice that we as men can suffer, but no one really points out.",1.0,1.0,1.0,6.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j6i37i/massive_headhunt_on_high_school_for_harassment/,RaringFob399
2020-10-07 09:40:40,"What life is like for men in a matriarchy (Mosuo in China): Women are regarded as the more effective sex and the only ones with influence. Men do relatively little work and are seen as disposable, often swapped as sex partners and used for the fruits of what labor they do.","This is based on a very pro-feminist [summary](http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/the-mosuo-matriarchy-men-live-better-where-women-are-in-charge-a-627363.html) from the Mosuo in China and some personal knowledge of their society from reading other summaries of the culture:

* Men do very little work and do not hold any status--authority is reserved for women. Men can hold notable positions--the mayor of the town is a man, but he has no authority and everyone ignores him because he is a man. This means men have little responsibility, but also little opportunity to achieve the goals they want in life.
* Physical violence is infrequent. Disputes are settled by women who give orders for reconciliation.
* Long-term relationships are very rare. Hookups (the women make the advances and choose their partners) are common. Marriage is presented as horrible and used to threaten children.
* Because no one knows paternity but maternity is rather obvious, women raise the children. Men do not have any involvement in child-rearing.
* Women are seen as the more effective and reliable gender. As a result, they hold most significant influence and mediate disputes. The one exception is men are seen as useful for making some large decisions that affect daily life (ie buying a house). 
* IMO, men seem to be largely disposable. They are changed quickly and often as sexual partners, are used for their labor. They cannot hold positions of standing and recognition within the society because of their gender.",1.0,1.0,1.0,19.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j6i45a/what_life_is_like_for_men_in_a_matriarchy_mosuo/,smeltaway

2020-10-07 11:04:30,Can't sleep. Need to get this out of my head.,"Living in Aberdeen, Scotland. It's 3AM as I'm writing this. It's been one year since I've been separated from my wife of 6 years. This morning at 10AM will begin my court case against me about domestic abuse of my wife. 

Exactly one year ago I have had enough of putting up with bad behaviour. Not only I was controlled who to talk to and how. I had to do what she wanted otherwise she was going absolutely crazy. Destroying things, tossing herself around and screaming like a possessed person. We have a 4 year old daughter and I hope I did everything I could to shelter her from witnessing that horror. But with time she didn't even mind that my girl was around. 

On our last encounter, right before my shift, she wanted to talk about us. If it's possible for me to forgive her for everything and if I still want to be together. I told her straight while she was on her knees begging, that It's better for us to split and be happy apart, for our girls' sake. I said maybe we just matched wrong, since we do have different characters and something is obviously triggering her rage. That was the moment she snapped as always and grabbed me by my shirt tearing it's buttons of and tried to push me out from our flat. From that I got really nice scratches running from my face down to my neck. They were very visible, but thank god I work night shift so not many people see me. Back to the story. I resisted her from throwing me out, since I can't work with a messed up uniform. When she calmed down I told her exactly that kind of behaviour is no good and how can she expect me to live with her. I grabbed my phone to call my work to let them know I will be late. She thought I am about to call police on her and tried to grab it. Probably to smash it as she did it before, while I was trying to record her fit sometime in the past.
We wrestled on the ground for a good 10 minutes. That resulted lite bruising on her forearms where I was holding her, preventing from doing something stupid with my phone again. When we both got tired and stopped, I managed to turn a small recording device that I kept with me for about few months. In case of events like that. She started crying and lamenting in how I could do this. That she is only a girl. I'm not suppose to do anything to her. She said that I shouldn't try to call for help or police can take away our daughter. How I have no chance get her, since I work night shift. That I cannot go my own way. That our girl needs both parents in the house:

‚Äúme- I don‚Äôt want Ilona to grow up like this.

wife- You are going to destroy her even more, because I won‚Äôt be able to control her alone neither can you control her alone. She‚Äôs a girl. Every man in the world will fuck this girl that you hold so dear. She will die of the most viral disease you can ever think of.

me- How can you say something like this?

wife- Oh! You‚Äôre daughter is pretty. Any girl that is beautiful like that will become a whore‚Ä¶‚Äù

Hearing things like that can destroy a father. I left for work and called police. Can you all guess what happened? Yep. They took my statement, and the next day I was taken away, since she said I was the one abusing her. Showing them her bruises. It didn't matter to police that I have chat logs or 31 hours of audio records admitting to vile behaviour. Some examples:

‚Äúwife- ...I will make your life miserable. As I have no hobbies, you will have no hobbies.‚Äú

or this

‚ÄúJ- Since you don‚Äôt hear a word. I didn‚Äôt tell you to bath her! I said I will bath her myself! Why are you still frustrating me?! I told you I will bath her, I didn‚Äôt beg you to bath her.

M- I just changed her.

J- I don‚Äôt want it any more. Leave her in her school clothes she came in! So when I come back I know what is happening in my own house! I warned you and this is the last time I warn you.

M- You never said anything before.

J- Leave her in her school clothes, if she has not bathed. No need to be wearing her clean clothes. I don‚Äôt understand your point, what are you trying to do there if it‚Äôs not criminal

M- Wha-

J- Will you shut up before I stab you? ‚Äú

Her case was obviously dropped. The crown didn't find anything. Maybe because the police officers didn't collect anything from me. I am the one that lost a flat, a car, constant contact with my child.

I just wanted to vent. But hear this. Depends on the trial outcome. If I will be found guilty, I will release everything online. All that dirt. I will not be portrait as a monster that she portrays me as. I will spread it all over medias if I will have to. It's not just about being petty. If I have a criminal record I will struggle to stay in this country as I am an immigrant just like my wife. I will do anything to clear my self.

Anyway. Better catch some sleep. Don't want to sleep through my own case.",1.0,1.0,1.0,25.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j6jcky/cant_sleep_need_to_get_this_out_of_my_head/,ironowner

all the comments were basically saying that if a man says something bad about his ex, he is actually the problem. it felt like women cannot be horrible and abusive. this greatly unsettled me. i have been in horrible relationships where the girl would fight me over everything, play suicide, play pregnant, use me as spare bf. and all the comments made me feel like i was the problem. any guy on the thread who dared say that women lied or mistreated them were being downvoted probably because the narrative established was that any man who says so are lying.

I'm currently struggling with myself and scared as fuck to get with any girl and i feel like im not good enough. i cannot do with all the negativities. there are a lot of support for women but a guy is expected to man up. then told repeatedly that man aint shit. can't we support women without dumping on men?

2020-10-07 16:55:37,Wikipedia - will decline for misandry,"Wiki has again asked me to make a financial contribution to their site. I  did this some time, before I became aware of their anti-male bias. When they asked a second time, I declined, citing same, and, especially their countenancing the sabotaging of pages connected with the men's rights movements by feminist saboteurs. Now they have asked me again, and they will get the same response. I intend to refer to their pages on MGTOW, and especially the fact that the movement is described as misogynistic within a very few words. I'll say something like this: ""You allow the MGTOW movement to be described as ""misogynistic"", a movement  aimed to help men avoid the enormous bias they face in family courts, sex offence laws, and life in general. How in any way is this ""misogynistic""? Yes, some MGTOW people will be misogynistic, but the movement cannot be described as such. And it isn't only on this subject that you allow inaccuracies and untruths to be propagated- almost every branch of the MRM is treated similarly. Compare this with the eulogistic treatment of the women's movements - a group that includes people who want to ""kill all men"".

Boy given estrogen in ‚Äòexperimental‚Äô treatment under juvenile detention

A lawsuit has alleged that a 16-year-old boy started to grow breasts after being wrongfully prescribed to take estrogen during his stay inside a Los Angeles juvenile detention center in the United States.

The teenager, whose name was withheld due to his age, was said to have been ‚Äúmedically treated by doctors without obtaining voluntary and informed consent‚Äù in June 2019, the lawsuit filed against Los Angeles County read.

The lawsuit, which was filed only last month, states that the parents of the minor were also not informed by the medical professionals of Eastlake Juvenile Hall, taking away their chance to deny or give permission.

The teen was diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), which is correlated with elevated levels of testosterone and delinquency in youths, as per the lawsuit.

Health professionals of the said institution were also said to have ‚Äúinvasively‚Äù drawn blood and urine samples from the minor, also without his and his parents‚Äô consent. The teen was then prescribed to take 30 doses of Estradiol, otherwise known as the female hormone estrogen, by one Dr. Danny Wang and the medical staff of the detention center.",1.0,1.0,1.0,155.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j6obmn/a_dangerous_precendent_16yearold_boy_starts_to/,Cryptolexicon

Sometimes abortions are too expensive for women to get
Her body, her choice. She thinks that the women should get to choose everything about the child because it's her body
The woman's parents maybe pro life and the women need help to raise a baby
It's the guys fault for getting her pregnant

I noticed that the moderators on r/Feminism and r/askfeminism (which are the same) ban people who either states positive or negative to their own beliefs. And they also check whether you are participating in this subreddit or not. So, apparently there is a way to report these moderators who abuse their power against freedom of speech and create fictional rules that aren't their in the sub. 

This is the link to report them to Reddit itself, so this could be stopped. 

https://www.reddithelp.com/en/submit-request/file-a-moderator-complaint
  
If anyone feels they know of a moderator who is breaking community guidelines, there is now a way to let reddit admins know.
  
https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines
  
Some of the rules:
  
Appeals to your actions should be taken seriously. Moderator responses to appeals by their users should be consistent, germane to the issue raised and work through education, not punishment.
  
Healthy communities are those where participants engage in good faith, and with an assumption of good faith for their co-collaborators. It‚Äôs not appropriate to attack your own users.

If a large amount of people complain to reddit, these unfair mods will be removed due to their bias actions which is against the rules.

So yea, Gucci is trying to sell a really ugly dress for $2600 in US Dollars to fight toxic masculinity. I don't even know what to say or where to begin. I feel like there are far better things to spend, invest, or even waste money on. I don't think men would even drop that much money into any piece of clothing. The most I have spent is like maybe $120 or so on sports jersey of my favorite athletes on my favorite sports teams. Now for the record, if a man wants to wear a dress, then fine to each their own. They can go do their own thing but I feel like this kind of dress could easily be found at a thrift shop for significantly less. So yea, here's a good laugh for you all.

My wife has always believed that circumcision is healthy and hygienic. When I said otherwise, she backed her argument based on some random articles that she read. She couldn't remember which ones they were or how to find them so I haven't read them.

Now, she's a very reasonable woman and is very accommodating. If I put my foot down she'll compromise, but I don't want this to be a source of contention that she'll resent me for. I want to convince her, not force her.

2020-10-08 15:26:37,"I read the Knights of Emerald, and I'm depressed","If you don't what Knights of Emerald is, it's a twelve books saga which told the story of an order of knights called ""The Knights of Emerald"". It's written by Anne Robillard, who made a sequel called ""The Heir of Enkidiev"". Here a summary : 

""Five hundred years ago, Enkidiev, a continent populated by humans, elves, and fairies, is being attacked by Amecareth, emperor of Irianeth and the insect empire. The threat of a new invasion looms over Enkidiev. The only hope for them to survive is to recreate the order of the Knights of Emerald by the King Emerald 1st. These magic warriors are to protect the continent until the prophesied Light holder can destroy the threat. It starts off with the land of Enkidiev, where multiple Kingdoms are situated. The Kingdom that is focused most upon is the Emerald Kingdom, seeing as the Emerald Knights are trained and will live there for the majority of their lives.""

I was 15 when I started the series, but there was something odd I remember when I heard that a man was charged for rape because he poke holes in a condom with a needle.

The leader of the order is Wellan, and he fell in love with the queen Fan of Shola who died at the first book. She became an immortal because of her great magic power and served the gods. They had sex pretty often (yes, you can have sex with a ghost) and we didn't know very well if Fan is in love with Wellan or not though she is his ""soul sister"". But, at the fourth book she rejected Wellan who wanted to have sex because it's not serious in this time of war, she cursed his legs so he feel an intense pain, and she showed to him her hidden son. But the worst part is coming : in the universe of Knight of Emerald, an Immortal can have sex with one mortal, but, not only the child can't see or talk to the mortal parent, but the mortal parent lost its ability to conceive an other child. So when Wellan and his second love wanted to have children, they learned this fact the hard way. 

Fan is a psychopath, who excused every problem she made by ""the will of the gods"". The gods didn't do anything to punish her because she almost broke the leader of the knights who protects their land. Wellan don't seem aware he suffers a sexual assault (or a rape) and nobody shame her assaillants for what she did. Worse, she become at the end of the story the goddess of Charity. Are you kidding me ?

It's depressing to see that kind of stories where female get away with sexual assault and minimize experiences of men.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j78rog/i_read_the_knights_of_emerald_and_im_depressed/,eugene_barjamel

\&gt;two of my female cousins are in university, 19 years old, going to different schools. Call them annie and betty

\&gt;Both quite smart, both valedictorians, both going to elite schools, both attractive, both majoring in STEM and getting good grades

\&gt;Betty, out of the blue, drops out of university her sophomore year and elopes with a guy she met 4 months earlier. He's a soldier with no degree

\&gt;The FURY from the family was incredible. ""She's wasting her life!"" ""She's throwing away her future!"" ""How DARE she just walk away from all that potential!""

\&gt;Oddly, her parents were fine with it, it was all the Aunts and female cousins.

\&gt;All tell Annie ""don't make that mistake! You stay in school. You'll have a bright future and get a DECENT husband!""

Last Christmas

\&gt;Go home for the big family Christmas

\&gt;Betty and her hubby are there with their five kids (oldest three grown and living on their own, and they're really great) and the GF of their oldest. Hubby retired with a full pension about 4-5 years ago, now he works as a security consultant. She has always been a stay at home wife.

\&gt;Annie is there. She's an assistant professor at some land grant university a state over. Never married, no kids, can't remember a boyfriend that lasted more than 8-9 months.

\&gt;After dinner we're all sitting around and Betty's oldest, 22 years old, had slipped off with his GF but comes back and tells us all he proposed and his GF said yes. His GF is just beaming as everyone rushing to welcome her to the family and admire her engagement ring.

\&gt;See Annie in the corner, quietly crying and wiping her eyes. I go to talk to her.

2020-10-09 04:30:30,"Treatment Of ""Incels"" By Society","Personally, what made me wake up about the need for a movement for men was the treatment of ""incels"" by society. I've been active on the left politically, I supported Bernie &amp; helped AOC win in 2017/2018 before most people knew who she was. I have a lot in common with ""incels"" though, and the tsunami of hatred just became way too much to ignore. To be demonized in such a way, and to be seen as a socially acceptable punching bag by people was, and continues to be, very disturbing to me. People think it's okay to call any male an ""incel"", which is really just a ""woke"" friendly way to call males you don't like a f\*g, there are a lot of people insulted and conflated with ""incels"" the way it's so commonly used. It's really just socially-sanctioned schoolyard like bullying towards alienated young men. Women get so much attention from society and are so valued and their problems are seen as such a big deal. Men, on the other hand, are constantly being told how terrible and ""privileged"" we are, despite no one giving a fuck about our suffering. My suffering has been bad enough only to be exacerbated even worse by people in this society who have the belief that it's perfectly fine to punch down on mentally broken young men, nevermind ""ableism"" in this case huh? It's very alarming because how could you get away with talking about anyone else like that these days? Looking more into this incel stuff and seeing that there are a lot of guys in my situation has made me understand that it's clearly a societal problem though, not just me. Leftists, especially leftist women, are often hypocrites about how they address this issue when they even address it at all. Feminists only care about women, it's not about gender equality. If it were truly egalitarian like they claim, the discussion would be much more even instead of being so one-sided in favor of women, because as I now know and you guys know there's no shortage of problems we have. We're just blamed for everything though, and the conversation about our issues is verboten because it makes women uncomfortable.",1.0,1.0,1.0,69.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j7kveg/treatment_of_incels_by_society/,Redsox_239

They start talking about how they‚Äôre gonna complain to the women and minority rights office or whatever it is and claim that the professor is sexist because most of the people who scored highest were male. Yes my professor is a jerk, but hes not sexist, he actually probably yells more at guys than girls. And maybe the reason those guys scored higher is because, oh idk, they put in the work to score that well?

2020-10-09 14:12:41,Enough is enough. Re: So-Called Feminist Outreach,"After yet another debacle of a thread with what counts as the latest missionary feminist out to extol the virtues of feminism, claiming they'd bring our concerns to the attention of r/feminism (and we all now how that always turns out even with non-feminists pleading for empathy from that sub-reddit) then revealing themselves as just the latest moderate sheep to swallow and regurgitate long established feminist tenants like Patriarchy Theory and Toxic Masculinity, this begs to be asked:

How long are we going to keep mindlessly dancing to the same tune?  

Always goes like this:

1)  Feminist posts a truce.
2)  Feminist claims to understand Men's Issues.
3)  Feminist is given examples of actual Men's Issues.
4)  Feminist falls back on Patriarchy Theory, Toxic Masculinity, Men needing to cry, etc.
5)  When challenged, they pull the ""That's not my feminism"", ""Feminism is about equality"" classical deflection.
6)  We never hear from them again.  (Or in the above case, their original post is deleted along with their username)

Except now I have had the ""privilege"" of learning another form of deflection that, frankly, makes me more sick to my stomach.

I specify the plague of toxic grrl power contaminating girl's minds thanks to media, politics and eductional institutions allowing feminism to push the narrative that all men, WHITE men particularly, are bad while women are helpless victims that we need to elevate in order to clean up the mess men made.

Here's this feminist's response:
&gt;It really varies from feminist to feminist. Because feminism can be a broad term and everyone has different views.

There you have it, folks.  This issue, along with male suicide, false rape accusations, male genital mutilation, biased divorce/family courts, male victims of domestic and sexual abuse lacking recognition let alone supports equivalent to female victims, the inability for men and boys to defend themselves from female bullies without the law and misandric people coming down HARD on them, the seriousness of these issues ""varies"" with feminists.  

I'd call it a logical conclusion to their ""Feminism is made up of a variety of views"".  Thanks to these views, feminists would rather debate and deliberate instead of take action.  

Enough!

I've had it with them extending an olive branch, I'm tired of people convincing me to accept it.  Because it all comes back to Patriarchy Theory, Toxic Masculinity, and Men bottling their emotions up for them.  Nothing more.

After that thread, and this feminist's deplorable apathy, so long as girls are walking around with tacky shirts like ""I'm a girl.  That's my superpower."", hitting boys, belittling them, then finding solace in their support structure, I will never believe any feminist when they say ""We care.  We're going to address it.""

2020-10-09 20:16:01,"European Commission President when talking about equality: ""Using only half of the population, half of the ideas or half of the energy is not good enough."" Really? Don't women a have any say on anything? Let's look at the reality behind the feminist crazy talk.","And by ""the reality"" I mean simply that of course women have a say on everything. I can't think a single area of life where only men would dominate. 

But that's not all, here are some reasons to think that women might have actually more influence on things than men:

* women have a strong ingroup bias and thus advocate women's issues

* men don't have a strong ingroup bias

* the people who are marginalized tend to be far more often men, and marginalized people by definition don't have a say on almost anything

* though the STEM field is somewhat more male there are other fields, perhaps socially more important, where women are in clear majority, like education

* education trends are pushing boys and young men away from many fields

All this, along with other things, has led to a situation where it's obviously quite easy to get women's issues on the political agenda, perhaps 1000 times easier to than to get amen's issues there.

Anyway, Ursula von der Leyen is apparently allowed talk like this in public. She most certainly has a totally different ""say"" than a man would have. She can talk bullshit and nobody as much as lifts an eyebrow. 

&gt; ‚ÄúGender equality is a core principle of the European Union, but it is not yet a reality. In business, politics and society as a whole, we can only reach our full potential if we use all of our talent and diversity. Using only half of the population, half of the ideas or half of the energy is not good enough.

https://preview.redd.it/bacjjwtj75s51.jpg?width=1940&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1de6873976a0452b2c194303fbbe4b2f5c03618b

We need to be laser-focused on changes currently happening in Police Training, Judicial Training and the Law, and we need to push back with everything we've got.

District Attorney Natasha Irving wants to ""reform"" the legal system by going forward with cases, even if there is not enough evidence an individual has committed a crime: [https://www.dailywire.com/news/district-attorney-in-maine-wants-to-start-prosecuting-people-based-on-accusations-and-nothing-else?itm\_source=parsely-api?utm\_source=cnemail&amp;utm\_medium=email&amp;utm\_content=020320-news&amp;utm\_campaign=position6](https://www.dailywire.com/news/district-attorney-in-maine-wants-to-start-prosecuting-people-based-on-accusations-and-nothing-else?itm_source=parsely-api?utm_source=cnemail&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=020320-news&amp;utm_campaign=position6)

She will use the following criteria:

1. Is the allegation credible? 

2. Is the victim willing to testify?

**That's all she needs.**

As we know, ""victims"" will be protected from prosecution if they make false allegations, thanks to trauma-informed training: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/j7mp9w/protecting\_women\_who\_make\_false\_rape\_allegations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/j7mp9w/protecting_women_who_make_false_rape_allegations/)

She will go forward even if it's obvious individuals will be found not guilty: ""That‚Äôs all it will take for Irving to drag someone through a lengthy court battle even if it‚Äôs obvious they will be found not guilty.""

But from her perspective, and from the victim's perspective, they don't necessarily have to win to score big.

The judicial process will be used as a weapon to drag men in a lenghty, tortuous process and hurt them:

"" First, it doesn‚Äôt have to in order to accomplish its goal. As the saying goes, you can beat the rap, but you can‚Äôt beat the ride. Men will be arrested and prosecuted, their faces and the accusations against them will appear in the media. They will lose their jobs, their homes, their families and be criminals. Even acquitted, the belief of guilt isn‚Äôt dissipated. After all, juries don‚Äôt return verdicts of ‚Äúinnocent,‚Äù but not guilty. And as the presumption of innocence is reduced to a ‚Äúlegal technicality‚Äù rather than a tenet of law, there is no way to overcome the taint. ""

Even if the Attorney and the ""victim"" don't obtain the verdict they want, a win (the destruction of a man) is a win and they will take it.

Other important changes happening currently: Trauma-informed training for attorneys and police officers, which protects people making false allegation from prosecution: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/j7mp9w/protecting\_women\_who\_make\_false\_rape\_allegations/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/j7mp9w/protecting_women_who_make_false_rape_allegations/)

Our net worth mirrors what we believe we‚Äôre worth. It doesn‚Äôt reflect what we're actually worth. Throughout the world, money is the greatest equalizer and status symbol. If you don‚Äôt have it, you don‚Äôt feel equal to your peers. The biggest problem in attaining wealth for most is imagining great dreams through the lens of a poverty mindset. In this episode of *The Early Morning Show*, we tell you how to kill this mindset.

&amp;#x200B;

Response to feminist post on r/Feminism. Men are called boys a lot more than women are called girls and when men are called boys it's extremely degrading, yet nobody gives a shit and laughs at it. When women are called girls (usually by other women), it's used in a playful manner or as a joke. 

&amp;#x200B;

Think of it this way (I'm using the opposite sex example so I can show you what it's really like):

A male says to a female ""Hey girl, wanna go out on a date?"", ok good enough

A female says to a male ""Heyyyy boys, wanna go out on a date?"", pretty degrading because girls is usually used as a female term while boys are used as an insult past the age of 11 when speaking directly (usually they're called guys) 

&amp;#x200B;

So as you can see, feminists are complaining about something that is really a male's issue, not a female. When have you ever seen a male call a female a girl in a degrading manner?

**If you are female and you deviate from the Female Supremacist agenda or dogma you face furious attack - even if you are not feminist.**

As Jo Freeman notes, these ""corrective"" attacks are ""done to disparage and destroy.""

Feminists resist the voice and views of any woman who speaks in an *unapproved* manner.

For example:

Brigitte Bardot suggested some claims of sexual harassment by females may not be true. She was *immediately* excoriated by furious feminists. (Unattributed (2018). Brigitte Bardot slams #MeToo 'publicity seeking' actresses. AFP, Jan 17 2018, and, Welsh, FNU (2018). Brigitte Bardot faces backlash over criticism of actresses in #MeToo movement. Huffington Post, Jan 18 2018).

Olympic star and America's sweetheart Gabby Douglas said ""It is our responsibility as women to dress modestly and be classy. Dressing in a provocative/ sexual way entices the wrong crowd."" The feminist backlash against teenager Douglas--for daring to suggest females play a role in sexual harassment--was instant and severe. (Griffith, Keith and Matthew Wright (2017). Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas apologizes for 'victim shaming' Aly Raisman by saying women have a 'responsibility to dress modestly.' Daily Mail, Nov 17 2017).

Podcast star Stasi Schroeder dared to ask if #MeToo is a ""male witch hunt."" Furious feminists went after Shroeder's ability to earn a living. They caused many of her sponsors to stop advertising on Schroeder's podcast show. (Unattributed (2017). Vanderpump Rules' Stassi Schroeder dropped by advertisers after podcast listeners accuse her of bashing #MeToo campaign. Daily Mail, Nov 25 2017).

Margaret Atwood, the 78 year old author of The Handmaid's Tale, suggested men accused of sexual misconduct are entitled to due process. **Atwood was subjected to immediate, vicious comments from feminists.** (Kassam, Ashifa (2018). Margaret Atwood faces feminist backlash on social media over #MeToo: The Canadian author's defense of due process for those accused of sexual misconduct sparked online ire. The Guardian, Jan 15 2018).

Angela Lansbury said women must take some of the blame for sexual harassment because they ""go out of their way to make themselves attractive"". 92 year old Lansbury was bullied by feminists. (Nussbaum, Daniel (2017). Angela Lansbury: Women 'must sometimes take blame' for sexual harassment. Breitbart News, Nov 28 2017, and, Harthorne Michael (2017). Angela Lansbury 'devastated' by backlash to comments. Newser, Nov 30 2017).

**Feminist author Germain Greer** said #MeToo victims are ""career rapees"" because they settle for money. She was immediately attacked by angry feminists for daring to suggest there may be a financial motive to making accusations of rape. (Hawken, Abe (2018). Outrage as feminist Germaine Greer suggests #MeToo victims are 'career rapees' for taking six-figure non-disclosure deals from Harvey Weinstein. Daily Mail, Mar 20 2018).

The message from feminists to all women seems clear: If you don't agree with us, shut up. As Emma Teitel notes ""feminism alienates people with dissenting opinions."" (Teitel, Emma (2014). Feminism is not whatever you want it to be. Macleans magazine, Aug 08 2014).

# Absolutely no Pity For Dissenters

[ The Righteous Sisterhood of Rage will Cancel and Expose all Fake Sis Posers.](https://preview.redd.it/isw0de2vdas51.jpg?width=1000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dffcdc6f4abf7716362205f3c68b08d1d0914daa)

Catherine Deneuve describes feminist bullying as ""this pack mentality which generates punishment, resignation and sometimes, and often, lynching."" (Not attributed (2018). 'I don't like this pack mentality': Catherine Deneuve clarifies her views on #MeToo movement following criticism for 'defending men.' Daily Mail, Jan 14 2018).

Melissa McEwen notes feminists ""can bully other women with 'check your privilege' statements.""

Mollie Hemingway describes, ""we witnessed a mob of online feminists harass a male scientist to the point of tears."" (Heminway, Mollie (2014). It's time to push back against feminist bullies. The Federalist, Nov 17 2014).

Hemingway goes on to describe another incident involving a different professor who wrote an article criticizing feminist bullying. Knowingly false accusations were lodged in an effort to get him fired. (Heminway, Mollie (2014). It's time to push back against feminist bullies. The Federalist, Nov 17 2014).

Actress Kirsten Dunst glorified ""nurturing, being a mother and cooking,"" adding relationships work when a man is a ""knight in shining armor"" because then a woman can ""be a woman."" Dunst was viciously attacked by feminists. For example: Erin Ryan said ""Kirsten Dunst is not paid to write gender theory, so it shouldn't surprise anyone that she's kind of dumb about it."" Stacy Ritzen called Dunst ""an insufferable person."" (Peyser, Andrea (2014). Dunst receives fury for feminine comments in Bazaar. New York Post, Apr 21 2014).

Feminists attacked one of their own--Mayim Bialik--because the actress revealed she dresses modestly to avoid assault. Bialik calls the choices she makes about her own body ""self-protecting and wise."" Ines Helene twisted Bialik's body ownership into accusations that ""she blames women"" (for being sexually harassed when they dress provocatively). Alana Massey said about Bialik ""\[ she is\] misguided and... mean-spirited."" (Sheth, Sonam (2017). 'The Big Bang Theory' star's op-ed about Harvey Weinstein sparks outrage on Twitter. Business Insider, Oct 14 2017).

Professor Laura Kipnis found herself on the receiving end of feminist bullying. Two feminist graduate students filed a Title IX complaint against her for publishing an article in the Chronicle of Higher Education. Why did they do it? **The graduate students wanted revenge because Kipnis addressed sexual paranoia on campuses from a perspective they didn't agree with.** (Cooper, Natasha (2015). Feminist students protest feminist prof for writing about feminism. Jezebel, May 29 2015)

What was done to Prof. Kipnis is an academic version of the Persky Effect. I wrote about the Persky effect here:

Furious feminist bullying is also meted out to center-right women who believe themselves to be feminist. As Anna Rhodes explains ""You're right-wing, therefore you cannot be a part of 'our' feminism."" (Rhodes, Anna (2015). Feminists like me are being bullied and silenced by left-wing socialists.

Can our Courts dispense true Justice?](https://preview.redd.it/iqy0qlxl5cs51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57d8903938267d31f82a04b3cc331223802c1e28)

**The Persky effect is the unwillingness of a judge to rule in a proper manner, fearing Feminist retaliation which will place his job security in jeopardy. Due process and the rule of Law are suborned to self-preservation and career protection.** 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

[ Judge Aaron Persky](https://preview.redd.it/x1xqh43v5cs51.jpg?width=840&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff583412190240cdd80784795f82caa8386e895c)

In 2016, Aaron Persky, Superior Court Judge and former prosecutor, acting on the recommendation of the Santa Clara Probation Department, sentenced first time offender **Brock Turner** to six months in Jail and three years probation.

Turner had been convinced of three counts of sexual assault.

Feminists began protests outside of the Santa Clara courthouse chanting ""Hey, hey, ho, ho, Judge Persky has got to go."" (Louie, David (2016). Protest held against Judge Persky following Brock Turner's release. ABC7, Sep 02 2016., See also: Roberts, Michelle (2016). Protests continue in fight to recall Santa Clara County judge in Brock Turner case. NBC, Sep 02 2016.)

In response, Persky stated that ""California Law requires every judge to consider rehabilitation and probation for first time offenders"", adding that a judge cannot allow the opinions of others to factor in his decisions.

*Furious* feminists targeted Judge Persky, leading him to resign from his position on the criminal bench and return to hearing civil cases (Smith, Doug (2016). Judge in Stanford rape case asks for move to civil cases. Los Angeles Times, Aug 25 2016.)

**\*\*This wasn't enough - Feminists wanted permanent blood from Judge Persky, to send a clear message to judges who might think about deviating from feminist judicial practice and feminist extra-judicial dogma.\*\***

More than a million signatures were obtained to place a recall vote on the June 05, 2018 ballot (August 02, 2016, CBS42, and, Associated Press (2017). Judge who gave Stanford rapist Brock Turner just six months in jail DEFENDS his decision in his first public statement. Daily Mail, Jul 01 2017.)

**Judge Persky was recalled.**

Ellen Kreitzberg, Law professor at Santa Clara University, describes the Persky intimidation tactic: **it is meant to make judges ""look over their shoulder"" and ""think twice"" about issuing a controversial decision** (Egelko, Bob (2018). Foes, backers of Judge Persky recall effort face off in debate. SFGate, Apr 20 2018.)

The contrast between the Persky case and other cases where the sex abuser was female reveals three absolute rules of Feminist judicial practice:

1. **If the defendant is male be maximally harsh on him.**
2. **If the defendant is female be maximally lenient on her.**
3. **If you do not obey these rules, we will destroy you.**

**..........**

**Side Note:**

Where were the Feminists when Elaine Goodman, 46, pleaded guilty to raping a 13 year old boy: ""He is so cute with a nice ass body."" She was only given probation (Seamons, Kate (2017). Women raped boy, 13, with 'nice body,' gets probation. Daily Mail, Jan 13 2017.)

Where were they when Katy Perry kissed 19 year old Benjamin Glaze without notice or consent?(Enriquez, Justin (2018). 'I was saving it for someone special': American Idol contestant says Katy Perry stole his 'uncomfortable' first kiss. Daily Mail, Mar 14 2018). Or when she pulled down the pants of another male to show his genitals to others? (Dier, Arden (2019). 2 people accuse Katy Perry of sexual misconduct. Newser, Aug 16 2019.)

Where were they when Corine Audiat , 32, pleaded guilty to two felonies for having sex with a 16 year old male student? (Burke, Minyvonne (2018). Married gym teacher, 32, could AVOID jail for having sex with her student, 16, and sending him flirty text messages as part of a controversial plea deal. Daily Mail, Jan 04 2018.)

Joanne Elwel stalked her ex-boyfriend's new girlfriend for seven months, sending disturbing and abusive email, online messages and Facebook communication. Elwel admitted guilt in exchange for zero prison time. Were there any protests at all? You can guess the answer. (Boyle, Darren (2018). Mother-of-three, 39, who stalked her ex-boyfriend's new partner by setting up a Facebook hate group which she even invited her to join is spared jail. Daily Mail, Apr 17 2018.)

2020-10-12 00:36:03,No Justice for Men: When Weaponized Courts Lynch Innocent Men with Unnecessary DVRO's (Domestic Violence Restraining Orders).,"&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ruhkyplnths51.jpg?width=1024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=938b85ea9c2fb5d0f8924bd27a3e3b793e0b3a4e

**Summary**: Issuing a family law DVRO (Domestic Violence Restraining Order) happens quickly and with virtually no due process. The order can exist for a lifetime and you will not experience justice. **DVRO's can be sought not for protection but for vengeance, to harm an ex-partner, to create untoward leverage in child custody and/ or divorce settlement negotiations, or for reasons not related to bone fide danger and fear.** Once your accuser and her judge come for you, watch out: being a ""nice man"" who has never been violent, never made a threat, never stalked, always been gentle, kind, a hard worker, good provider and a good father--these offer ZERO protection against the malice of an accuser intent on taking you down.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Why wouldn't females take advantage of a judicial process heavily weighted in their favor? The DVRO will severely bludgeon their ex-partner and at the same time create substantial negotiating leverage.""

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ybvnc3wqths51.jpg?width=945&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fba166ebbbe7ba5169405c42fbb0b8c22799c8a7

**Every man is at risk for having a family law ""Domestic Violence"" restraining order (DVRO) issued against him even though the vast majority have never committed any acts of domestic violence or crimes.** 

Senior trainers of family law judges admit this is true:

""If you have no DV at all... you could file an action that clearly has no DV - you don't even have to lie - you can say 'I want a domestic violence restraining order because my husband said he's going to fight me for the kids"" (Today's Law: Family Law Update. Judicial Council of California training video, Apr 09 2014 at 32: 33)

""You may make the following kinds of orders: A DV protection order, a support order, a custody order. It's not conditional upon first finding DV occured."" (Today's Law: Family Law Update. Judicial Council of California training video, Apr 09 2014 at 31: 48 exactly).

# TEST TO DETERMINE IF A DVRO WOULD BE ISSUED AGAINST YOU

**Answer the following questions to determine if a DVRO would be issued against you:** 

\- Are you male? 

\- In the last 10 years have you done at least one of the following to a current or former female intimate partner? 

1. You got angry at her or you raised your voice to her. 
2. You set a financial spending limit for her. 
3. You withheld important information from her. 
4. You told someone something embarrassing about her. 
5. You said something mean in order to make her upset. = = OR = = You are presently involved in a divorce or custody dispute.

\- Would your accuser tell the judge she is afraid of you even if she actually isn't?

If the answer to all three questions is ""YES,"" you are at 100% risk of having a family law DVRO issued against you if one is requested.

# The DVRO Process happens quickly. 

Generally there are three steps: The requesting party submits a form to family law court asking for a DVRO. 

**The same day**, **without a hearing**, a judge issues a **Temporary Restraining Order** (TRO). 

You the accused are not present and do not learn about the TRO until a police officer shows up at your work or home to serve you.

# The TRO orders you to move out of your home immediately. 

You are not allowed to contact your children and you are not allowed to contact your estranged partner. 

The TRO notifies you of the date and time of the hearing where a judge will decide whether to issue a **permanent DVRO** against you.

# The hearing for a permanent order will be held about three weeks later. 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/fe6wlvatths51.jpg?width=1332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e66a7554a33a059f60431eaaf6744334d5e0f2a9

**The hearing will last as little as five minutes.** 

**You do not have the right to have an attorney appointed to represent you.**

The state will provide an attorney for your accuser if she requests one. 

These are provided through victim's organizations funded by state and federal grants. 

You do not have the right to call witnesses, to present evidence, or to cross-examine your accuser.

If the judge issues a DVRO you are not entitled to a written decision explaining the judge's reasons for issuing the order. 

You can request a trial but only if you do so before the DVRO is issued.

# If you request a trial it will be held one to six months later.

**You do not have the right to a jury trial.** 

**The trial will be over in as little as 15 minutes.** 

*You do not have the right to have an attorney appointed to represent you.* 

**The state will provide an attorney for your accuser if she requests one.** These are provided through victim's organizations funded by state and federal grants. 

You do not have the right to call witnesses, to present evidence, or to cross-examine your accuser. 

Unless the trial lasts more than a day you are not entitled to a written decision explaining the judge's reasons for issuing the DVRO. 

Because family law DVRO's can be renewed for life without any additional allegations, a man can have a lifetime DVRO issued against him and no one will know why it was issued.

# Wait - There's More!

**Hearsay by your accuser is generally admissible.** 

There is no procedural mechanism to assess whether your accuser is making false accusations. 

**If you challenge the credibility of your accuser judges are trained to interpret this as: You are trying to ""further abuse your victim."" You are trying to re-establish ""power and control"" over your ""victim."" (Trauma-informed training)**

Judges are trained to interpret inconsistent and contradictory statements made by your accuser as evidence she has experienced severe trauma and not that she may be lying or making false accusations.

# What Happens After A Family Law DVRO Is Issued 

Men who have family law DVRO's issued against them are punished severely merely by the order being issued.

You will lose primary custody of your children and you may lose visitation altogether.

The child support you pay will be substantially increased when you lose custody and visitation. 

You will have to move out of your home immediately. 

You will be ordered to pay spousal support. 

Your accuser will receive free legal assistance paid for by government grants. 

That free lawyer will crush you in court and you will be ordered to pay her costs even though there was no actual cost to your accuser. 

You will be dealt with harshly by the judicial system once you are labeled a ""domestic violence abuser.""

You will be ordered to attend a weekly batterers intervention program class for a year. You are not allowed to graduate until you admit being a violent abuser. The judge will be told you are in denial and not cooperating with the program if you don't. The judge can find you in contempt of court, throw you in jail and charge you a fine. Many innocent men falsely confess in order to see their children again.

**Your firearms will be permanently taken away even when there were no accusations of crime, threats, stalking or violence. This is done through the intentional misuse of a federal law meant to take guns away from convicted criminals.** 

You will no longer be able to pass a background investigation needed to teach school, coach little league or serve as a scouting leader. 

Your credit may be harmed as a result of the financial toll associated with the DVRO process, and also fighting to see your children again. 

Many men report having to choose between paying an attorney to help them get visitation with their children or paying the rent. The financial harm can take years to reverse.

Even if you did not commit violence or crime nevertheless you will improperly be labeled a ""domestic violence abuser"" for the rest of your life. 

You may sustain substantial mental trauma. This may include chronic nightmares and PTSD.

# DVRO's are convenient and provide many benefits to the accuser

DVRO's are great for:

Sabotaging your parenting time. 

Sabotaging your relationship with your children. 

Sabotaging your new relationships. 

Satisfying a need for revenge. 

Satisfying a need to show spite. 

Satisfying a need to cause suffering. 

This may include causing the loss of your job, causing the humiliation of being labeling an abuser, and being able to remove your children from your life. 

Setting up a circumstance where dismissal of the order can be sold for money and other concessions.

A DVRO's can be issued without basis or on the sparse basis of a single incident of disturbing the emotional calm of the accuser.

Family law judiciary is anything but fair and equal when it comes to issuing DVRO's.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j98kvd/no_justice_for_men_when_weaponized_courts_lynch/,Cryptolexicon

2020-10-12 01:41:43,Pulling back the curtain on Dating Apps: MGTOW is the way.,"Ok please read this before you even bother to comment:

***THIS IS MY OPINION.  Of course you can disagree and of course there are exceptions to any argument.  I am simply wanting to post my thoughts.  So if you want data, please search it on your own.  This is NOT  a research paper or survey and I have not claimed it to be.  This is a culmination of one man's experience with dating apps and his own personal evolution in his own thoughts.  Thank you.***

For the last few years, I've started to really take notice of a shift in our culture.  The hookup culture.  Of course this is not a new concept by any means.  Now a days, with more and more services pushing harder for instant gratification: aka UberEats, 2 day shipping, DLC, etc...   It makes sense that after a while things would naturally shift to the culture of simply cutting to the chase with dating and getting physical as soon as possible.  Which by the way, is nothing wrong as long as both parties are consensual and not with ill intent.  

In any case, over time I started to notice that since dating has now shifted to instant gratification for the most part, I started to question why we even bother filling out bios if what most people are searching for is simply hooking up?  Now again, there will be tons of people who say, ""Well, I'm on there for a real relationship"" and that's totally fine, so was I.  But it seems that since the overwhelming majority of the people on dating apps are searching for simply physical attraction, I kinda wonder why we even bother texting or exchanging anything if that's the most important thing?  

For example, one of the most common requirements that women post is that they want men that are 6ft tall.  And just for reference, only a little over 14% of the male population in the US are over 6ft tall.  ([https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/the-necktie-syndrome-why-ceos-tend-to-be-significantly-taller-than-the-average-male/articleshow/10178115.cms?from=mdr](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/the-necktie-syndrome-why-ceos-tend-to-be-significantly-taller-than-the-average-male/articleshow/10178115.cms?from=mdr) ) But again, this is fine if that's your preference but if you just flipped the script for a minute and asked if a man were to print in his bio that he wants a woman to be a dress size  2 as a minimum requirement wouldn't that be just as unrealistic and shallow as the first request?  Aren't these traits things that have nothing to do with long term sustainability when it comes to personality compatibility?

But ok, let's put that aside.  What I've started to notice is that the current trend among a lot of online dating is physical compatibility and much less about what each person offers in terms of their personality.  Which again is fine.  It is what it is.  And I have no problem with that since this is what it has come to nowadays: a shitshow.

So rather than sit here and whine and bitch about it, I realized that this brings me to two choices:  Either I continue to swim among the beta simps and continue to get nowhere or go my OWN way and better my own life and attract those who truly WANT to be with me.

I want to add that unlike most people who haven't really spent the time really diving deep into MGTOW, you will find that as with any philosophical thought, it is a choice of lifestyle nothing more.  It is not a political movement nor radical in concept.  It's simply choosing to do what is in the best interest of your own existence which is to better yourself at all costs and make yourself the focus of your life.  

And as with every school of thought, radicalism or extremity will often turn these things into a counter productive or even negative outlet.  So basically, do with it as you see fit.  

I personally take it as a lifestyle means to better myself and value myself more now.  Not to depend on women as a source of company but be my own best company.  And if a woman does fall into my life, that she is truly there for the right reasons and not to detract from what I have accomplished nor change what makes me happy in my life.

So with that, I went ahead and deleted all my dating apps today.  And I haven't felt this good in a long time.  

Gentlemen, don't let the dating scene get you down.  Know your value and live for you.  Never let a woman define your worth because trust me THEY don't.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j99rdb/pulling_back_the_curtain_on_dating_apps_mgtow_is/,fyp2017

Pretty much one I was walking home from school and two sophomore girls called me over to talk to her(I didn‚Äôt know them, but they knew me) so I came over. And they told do a slut drop, I didn‚Äôt know what that was so I asked her. Than she did it, it is like falling sexually (I don‚Äôt know how to describe it)unfortunately me a teacher saw that, and decided to start yelling at me on why was I harassing them and make her do sexual dances and stuff like that. He than forced me to come back inside the school ,(them too) and instead of them just telling the truth. They decided it was just easier to blame me, saying that I threatened them, and forced them to do that. I of course denied any of this, and said they approached me. The school security cameras didn‚Äôt help as well, since they didn‚Äôt record audio. And I got 5 days Out of School Suspension. Worst part is my own parents didn‚Äôt believe me, and my dad gave me beating I would never forget. After that I got a 0 on any of the missing work which of course all my teachers chose to give quizzes that week. Which again my dad beat me for. I was kicked out a few my honors and AP Classes, and was banned from NHS from my school. Finally my own teachers decided instead of helping me during this time, decided to give me lectures on  what I did was a horrible thing and were shocked, I could even do such a thing. And for the rest of the year my orchestra teacher decided to constantly remind me and my friends of it. They didn‚Äôt even listen to my side they just assumed I was this evil person who got off from harassing girls.

I have shared and equal custody of my child and my CS payments were calculated based on my employment income. 

This year during the pandemic I started an online business (sole owner) and I'm on track to make $120k in Net Profit.

My question is this:

If I quit my full time job and put myself on a W2 where the C-Corp pays me a salary comparable to my employer (say $40k/yr) would I be insulating the remaining $80k from being taken into consideration from the CS calculator?

What are my options when it comes to claiming that extra $80k as ""working capital"" or business reserves?

# Silencing Young Men is not Enough...

Alison Downie, a professor at Indiana University, only allows female students to respond to ""female only"" questions. Lake Ingle tried to answer such a question. He did this to challenge Downie's ""blatant discrimination based on sex."" **Lake Ingle was suspended from class and Downie requested he be kicked out.** ( James, Vincent (2018). Student banned from class for challenging professor on gender wage gap. The Red Elephants, Mar 09 2018).

Sociologist Jacqueline Warwick, professor of gender studies, limits the participation of male students. ""Men are not allowed to speak first."" Warwick want this to become policy in all classes on her campus, not just her own (Timpf, Katherine (2015). 'Feminists' think female students are too scared to speak in class? National Review, Jan 22 2015).

Professor-in-training Stephanie McKellop, a graduate student at University of Pennsylvania takes it a step further: ""I will always call on my Black Women students first, other people of colour get second tier, then White Women **and** ***if I have to*****, white men**."" (Wright, Matthew (2017). 'I always call on my black women students first': Penn teaching assistant under fire for saying she won't call on white male students in class. Daily Mail, Oct 20 2017. Notice McKello's use of the possessive ""my black women."").

 **Some universities run thought reprogramming courses for male students.**

These courses are designed to replace ""biases"" with approved mental cognitions. None of these programs have been empirically assessed to see if they cause short or long term harm to the young men who are being mentally reprogrammed. Studies have not examined for important possibilities such as increased rates of suicide, increased use of alcohol and drugs, **decreased scholastic grades**, **elevated rates of drop out**, increased fear of dating or the triggering of one or more mental illness crisis.

**At the University of Texas at Austin the mental health center treats masculinity as a mental illness.** They combat it through their ""MasculinUT"" program. The goal is to teach men to reject masculinity and traditional roles such as protector/provider. They teach men not to strive for success in a masculine way.

The mental health center at Brown University runs a reprogramming treatment class titled ""Masculinity 101"". **Male students are deprogrammed from ""toxic masculine norms"" and mentally reprogrammed to feminist-defined roles** (Mastrangelo, Alana (2018). Brown University provides programs for 'unlearning toxic masculinity.' Breitbart, Oct 23, 2018).

First year male students at Gettysburg College are forced to watch a film which describes ""toxic masculinity"", **then participate in a four hour reprogramming session which describes masculinity as ""an unacceptable human trait.**"" (Freshmen at Gettysburg College are forced to watch a film that tells them the phrase 'be a man' is 'toxic masculinity.' Daily Mail, Oct 18 2016).

Claremont College held an event ""Masculinity+Mental Health"", teaching male students ""Masculinity can be extremely toxic to our mental health."" (Payton, Bre (2016). College students: Masculinity is 'extremely toxic to our mental health.' The Federalist, Oct 04 2016).

Duke University runs a ""Men's Project"", consisting of a 9-week seminar which ""questions and deconstructs toxic masculinities"" (Alexander, Harriet (2016). U.S. university offers course for men to 'deconstruct toxic masculinities.' The Telegraph, Oct 01 2016). They also offer ""safe spaces"" where male students can ""contemplate their toxic masculinity."" (Melchior, Jillian (2016). Duke offers men a 'safe space' to contemplate their 'toxic masculinity.' Fox News, Oct 02 2016).

The University of Wisconsin created ""safe spaces"" where males attend a 6-week program to deprogram ""toxic masculinity"". Young men are then mentally reprogrammed to be social justice warriors who ""advance gender equity and raise consciousness in their communities.""

Princeton University believes incoming male students are angry, violent and potential rapists. (Krayden, David (2017). Princeton seeks to restrain males and their 'toxic masculinity. The Daily Caller, Jul 25 2017).

Wheaton College (Massachusetts) created ""safer spaces"" through their ""Healthy masculinity"" program, where male students are able to discuss ""healthy and toxic masculinity"".",1.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j9enev/silencing_young_men_in_class_is_not_enough_taking/,Cryptolexicon

**Extract from ""Female Violence in Italy. An emerging discourse of Heterosexuality"":**

""The phenomenon of female violence perpetrated by women (so forth female violence) is acknowledged in criminology and family studies and it is also discussed in cultural studies as a stereotypical monstrous and erotic representation of deviant women. However, it remains a neglected topic in any public discourse of ordinary domestic and partner violence. In Italy, a new discourse on female ordinary violence in heterosexual context is emerging from a heterogeneous social movement. Through interviews with men‚Äôs right, shared parenting and divorced father activists, family violence professionals, and opinion makers, main features of this emerging discourse are revealed. Central is the urgency to challenge the normalized dichotomy of male aggressor and female victim by rendering visible specific modalities of female violence.

Stereotyped perception of dominant masculinity as inviolable and violent and gender differences in socialization of violence are core barriers hindering public acknowledgment of this emerging discourse on female ordinary violence in context of heterosexuality. This discourse can be politically subversive in that it requires overcoming fixed gender stereotypes with a redefinition of ordinary masculinity as emotive and potentially vulnerable and a redefinition of ordinary femininity as aggressive and potential harmful.""

...

"" ...a discourse that provides narratives, organizations, and celebrations focused on female victims whilst male victims are left in the background, with few interpretive frameworks. This discourse reinforces dominant stereotyped masculinity and femininity: men are depicted as social threat, inviolable, actors of violence; women as passive and harmless victims. ""

...

"" Instead, the female perpetrated partner violence discourse is worthy of study for two main reasons. It brings to the fore victims that so far have remained neglected by public policies; it is politically subversive in that it enables to innovate fixed gender identities with characteristics of women and men that are denied by dominant discourse: male suffering and female agency to harm.""

From birth, Feminists target children -- both their own and also yours.

As Reva Seth says: ""It is critical to raise them as Feminists... We can raise our children to be the change we want."" (Source: Seth, Reva (2018). How to raise a feminist. Today's Parent, Mar 08 2018).

Children raised in homes that teach conservative and religious values are targeted for re-education as soon as they begin kindergarten. Whether feminists are programming their own children or covertly re-programming yours, the end goals are the same: **Make Them Feminist**.

..........

# Undoing What You Teach Your Children

Feminist teachers like Anna North admit that teaching Feminism to children in school is meant to change the way their parents have raised them (North, Anna (2010). Should we teach feminism in school? Jezebel, Feb 09 2010). If you are raising a masculine son or a feminine daughter, or if you have taught them to love America, or to follow a moral religion -- **feminist teachers will erase these ""biases""**.

Lauren Schumaker notes: ""Concepts like intersectional feminism can sometimes be tricky to teach little ones. So she recommends using books such as ""Feminist baby"", ""Strong is the new Pretty"" and ""Boy who cried Fabulous"".

[The Boy who cried Fabulous, by Leslea Newman.](https://preview.redd.it/0muc3xzlnks51.jpg?width=1500&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8c7878868ef6ea02c5f367d5390f70d2534490d)

Schumaker says books such as these make great bedtime stories (Source: Schumacker, Lauren (2017). 14 books that teach intersectional feminism to kids. Romper, Mar 16 2017).

Stela Lithgow offers free **""Feminist Powerpoints""** to other teachers to use when indoctrinating children (Lithgow, Stella (2012). Feminist powerpoint. TES Global). Stela isn't alone: there are hundreds of websites where feminist teachers share their materials with each other.

As the leader of RedforEd, a lefty teacher's movement says, ""Teaching is Political"".

**In some places schools absolutely forbid parents from removing their children from re-education lessons -- if they find out about them.**

As the attorney for the Orange County board of Education states in an advisory letter to the board: ""Parents who disagree with the instructional materials related to gender, gender expression and sexual orientation may not excuse their children from this instruction"" (Starnes, Todd (2018). School district forbids parents from opting out of LGBT lessons. [www.toddstarnes.com](https://www.toddstarnes.com/), Apr 25 2018).

# All It Takes is One Week to Radicalize Your Child

In a famous experiment run by Ron Jones in Palo Alto, it only took five days to undo a lifetime of parental training and turn good kids into aggressive fascists ready to force their dogma on all outsiders. (Source: Zimbardo, Philip (2008). The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil. New York: Random House, pp. 281-283). Other studies have produced the same rapid change to Fascism (Source: ibid., Zimbardo (2008). Zimbardo lists additional examples on p. 283-288).

**If you are not closely, carefully and frequently monitoring what is taught to your child, they can be radicalized very quickly by a Feminist teacher on a mission.**

..........

# Turning Little Boys Into Obedient Beta

Feminist mothers work very hard to break the developing masculine nature of little boys, something they call ""toxic"".

Jaclyn Friedman states: ""Traditional masculinity can be harmful to boys"" (Friedman, Jaclyn (2018). Building better men: How we can begin to redefine masculinity. The Guardian, Mar 12 2018).

Avital Nathman adds: ""We as parents have to actively fight against the toxic culture of masculinity."" (Nathman, Avital (2015). The mamafesto: Are you raising a boy or a toxic man? She Knows, Aug 31 2015).

Casi Koon warns that if sons are allowed to toughen up, which is ""toxic"", they may become a mass murderer or trade sex for starring roles as Harvey Weinstein did (Koon, Casi (2017). Raising boys in a world of toxic masculinity. Mom Me online, Oct 12 2017).

Feminist mothers work hard to turn their sons into submissive beta males who think feminist thoughts, are soft and tender and fragile, and have been taught to submit to females and the matriarchy.

As Amanda Prestigiacomo states: ""Feminists are cool with men just so long as they suppress all masculinity."".",1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j9ibd8/feminist_strategy_target_children_from_birth/,Cryptolexicon

[\\""Keep them Angry. They will not Question their Anger. Mold their Anger, Feed it continually and Leverage it.\\""](https://preview.redd.it/t7bv0iwrrks51.jpg?width=768&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=57cb2e518e3138095241b7e0db05f38d5ae294ca)

It takes an extraordinary amount of energy to break down and reshape a society.

So, where do Feminists get the energy to relentlessly work to advance the glorious Matriarchy?

**Feminist energy comes from perpetual Rage.** A radicalized individual will ignore discomfort, inconvenience and personal cost (including financial cost) because they are devoted to enacting goals that are deeply believed in.

As Ingrid Nilsen notes, ""Anger fuels passion, passion fuels knowledge and knowledge fuels change. So instead of pushing your anger away, welcome it to the table and listen to what it has to say... anger is instrumental to being a feminist."" (Originally, ""I've realized how instrumental anger is to being a feminist."" Nilsen, Ingrid (2016). In defense of 'angry feminists.' Metro, Apr 01 2016).

Julie Gerstein adds, ""Angry feminism may not be particularly digestible,"" but, being an angry feminist plays ""a valuable role in feminism."" (Gerstein, Julie (2010). In defense of ""angry"" feminists. The Frisky, Aug 25 2010).

Madeleine Davies says feminists must be filled ""with rage on a daily basis."" (Davies, Madeleine (2014). I am not an angry feminist, I'm a furious one. Jezebel, May 28 2014).

\[Of course things can go too far. That is why Mireille Young, a professor of feminist studies at UCSB was sentenced to attend an anger management course. Young put on an angry feminist display against some students who happened to have a different point of view (Schow, Ashe (2014). Anger management and community service for feminist professor who attacked pro-life students. Washington Examiner, Aug 19 2014).

Similarly, feminist legislator and former prosecutor Katherine Rogers was convicted of assault and ordered to attend an anger management class. Rogers punched a Republican supporter of the Second Amendment as he was observing a vote recount (Ricciardella, Will (2018). Dem lawmaker hit with justice, pleads guilty to assaulting well-known gun rights activist. Independent Journal Review, Jan 01 2018).\]

The perpetual fury of Female Supremacism is sublimated into a powerful, devoted, sustained drive to penetrate all levels of society--with each individual operationalizing dogma within her own milieu.

# Little girls must be taught Anger and Fury early on

As Soraya Chemaly writes: ""Girls need to know--and should be told explicitly--that it's alright to feel anger."" (Chemaly, Soraya (2016). Does your daughter know it's ok to be angry? Role Reboot, May 09 2016.)

Jen Mann says to ""Make sure she knows girls can get angry... she has the right to get loud."" (Mann, Jen (2018). 25 Rules for raising daughters. The Scary Mommy, Apr 07 2018.)

Daniele Lazarin takes anger a step further. ""I'm teaching my daughters to be rude."" (Lazarin, Danielle (2018). Why I'm teaching my daughters to be rude. The Cut, Feb 05 2018.)

**In order to replace a girl's ""useless"" innocence with anger, you can never start too early:**

As Amy Packham notes, you have to teach ""feminism... from an early age."" (Packham, Amy (2018). How to teach your sons and daughters about feminism. Huffington Post, UK, Aug 03 2018.)

Meg Kehoe says, ""Teaching a child feminism starts ""from day one."" (Kehoe, Meg (2015). 8 things to teach your child about feminism, because starting them early matters. Romper, Dec 07 2015.)

Perelandra Beedles writes, ""Sexism is alive and kicking... counteracting these messages with a dialogue about feminism can never start to young.""

# Radicalize, Channel and Unleash Female Fury through Tactics such as ""Alinsky Attacks"" 

https://preview.redd.it/lmwanmnesks51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b5c645d834da24d0c4395dff1d1f89b52e0d764e

""Alinsky attacks"" are used to furiously shut down an opponent's momentum and put them on the defensive. These were designed by Saul Alinsky who wrote a book of dirty tactics titled ""Rules for Radicals."" (Alinsky, Saul (1971). Rules for radicals. New York, Random House.)

Alinsky tactics destabilize traditional systems from within through the use of non-stop agitation, creating a perception of disenfranchisement, formulating discontent and seizing power when possible. Alinsky, Hillary Clinton's Mentor, adds **""the end justifies almost any means.""**

In other words it is OK to commit unlawful, immoral, deceptive and dirty tricks or criminal acts if these will achieve your goals. 

The essence of all Alinsky strategies is to be deceptive about what you are doing. 

Destructive goals must be ""clothed in moral arguments,"" salted with ""terms like 'liberty, equality, fraternity, common welfare, and pursuit of happiness."" (Basically, the Phraseology of Equity Feminism).

**Alinsky's 14 strategies are summarized here:**

Create fear and confusion in the enemy, not allies.

Power is what the enemy thinks you have.

Don't bluff, only use the power you actually have.

Confuse the enemy by getting him to operate in unfamiliar areas.

Make the enemy follow their own rules.

Ridicule is your most potent weapon.

Use tactics your radicals enjoy applying to the enemy.

Tactics should be applied quickly.

Keep the pressure on, mix tactics and use every event to a purpose.

Don't be afraid of threats, they are usually not that bad.

Relentlessly apply pressure to the enemy.

Continue negative attacks until they succeed.

Push a constructive alternative.

""Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.""

Female Supremacists frequently use the Alinsky tactic of ridicule when they call any man who doesn't agree with them ""misogynistic"" or ""Toxic"".

False accusations also operationalize Alinsky's ""the ends justifies almost any means."" It is OK to make false allegations, so long as the false accusation wins an advantage. Missing is any concern that false accusations are morally wrong. Weaponized false accusations are accepted practice.

2020-10-12 23:27:05,Why is it still okay that men get rejected cruelly?,"A couple of months ago, I witnessed an astounding display:
I was in a restaurant and from a table nearby , a guy started to talk a woman down, presumably his date. He was saying ""look at how fat you are, I can't believe you have the audacity to go on a date with me"".
The woman left in tears and everyone in the restaurant was baffled. 

But while this is distressing and shameful, the reverse seems to be okay for most people, like a social convention almost. When a man tries to get an attractive woman, chances are that he'll have to go through a series of semi-humiliations. He will get mocked, he will get insulted. If he's not attractive enough in the first place, he might even become an object to channel frustrations upon. In the other case, there's a high chance that he'll have to go through the motions. Like an initiation ritual almost. And if he's lucky, his perseverance will be deemed 'worthy'.

I on the other hand, if I only get the slightest hint of such a display, I consider it unsincere and stop bothering.",1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j9sxik/why_is_it_still_okay_that_men_get_rejected_cruelly/,Partlys4int

2020-10-13 00:52:53,Red Pill Effects That Changed My Perspective on Modern Dating: MGTOW is the Way,"Ok please read this before you even bother to comment:

***THIS IS MY OPINION. Of course you can disagree and of course there are exceptions to any argument. I am simply wanting to post my thoughts. So if you want data, please search it on your own. This is NOT a research paper or survey and I have not claimed it to be. This is a culmination of one man's experience with dating apps and his own personal evolution in his own thoughts. Thank you.***

Many of the current trends I have noticed in my own experience with online dating seem to mainly hyper focus on the physical appearance and almost completely disregards the main element that makes compatibility relevant in a relationship.

This is of course not to say that physical appearance is important as it clearly is.  However, if the focus is mainly centered around physical appearance then it's no wonder that most men now a days have simply given up on this platform and embraced the philosophy of MGTOW.

Now to make things clear from my own end, I don't personally believe MGTOW to be a movement, political in nature, nor asking anyone to change anything in any way.  Rather to me, it seems more of an education and philosophy that gives you information to make your OWN choices in life.

Many people immediately jump on this and say it's a women's hate movement but what I have gathered from this is that only in its EXREME or RADICAL form does it transform to that entity.  The core of MGTOW is really about choosing to better yourself as a man and come to embrace our own masculinity as a gift and wonderful thing to celebrate.  

Too often, now a days it's mainstream and acceptable  overall as a society to shame men for everything from their penis size to height to being overly emotional etc..  And rather than simply be angry about it, MGTOW seems to say that why don't we just walk away from all this BULLSHIT and work on ourselves?  Make ourselves better which will in turn attract people who actually WANT to be around us?

So this brings me to my point that once you have truly red pilled yourself, you realize that this ENTIRE online dating game is simply a SIMP ACADEMY or a buffet for Chads.  I mean, let's face it.  Either your a CHAD who is getting the buffet of responses or your a beta simp doing anything and everything you can to get a woman's attention on these dating apps.  

If this makes no sense to you.  Let me ask you this:  Why do the ""attractive"" women on these dating sites post this so often?  ""I""m not on here alot.  Follow me on IG@""   or ""here's my snap""   Sure could be bots, but it could also be simply a simp army recruitment center as well.  I mean why else would you post your IG account to EVERYONE if you didn't even match?  Like wtf?  

Also women mostly use dating apps as a form of entertainment and ""ego boost"" anyway.  Think about it.  Do quality attractive women even need to use a dating app to get attention?  They get it IRL every single fucking day.  And this also applies to every Chad as well.  They do well both irl and in the online dating world.  

So rather than spending all my time swimming among beta simps, I asked myself: ""What would be a better use of my time?""   

MGTOW is the way.   Because for me, focusing on myself and living for myself is nothing new and in the end, it's what attracts people to you anyway.  

Best of luck gentlemen in your journey.",1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,/r/MensRights/comments/j9ul2d/red_pill_effects_that_changed_my_perspective_on/,fyp2017

We had fun discovering new toys, like the pulsating cock ring with clit-pleasure giving features. I wasn't able to find a masturbation toy that resembled a vagina's entrance visually. So I inquired at the front desk to see if they have any, only to receive a response with an attitude, explaining that they don't stock any toys that objectify women.

*Processing video 9kz922n9ops51...*

Link: [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/was-what-jenny-mccarthy-did-to-justin-bieber-sexual-assault/article5448106/](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/the-hot-button/was-what-jenny-mccarthy-did-to-justin-bieber-sexual-assault/article5448106/)

Bieber: ""I feel violated right now.""

""Note the horrified expression on poor Bieber's face, as he struggles out of the model-comedian's grasp while she repeatedly kisses his neck and grabs his buttocks.

""I couldn't help it, he was just so delicious,"" McCarthy says.

[In a backstage interview](http://www.accesshollywood.com/jenny-mccarthy-dishes-on-her-cougar-fantasy-kiss-with-justin-bieber-at-amas_article_72714) with Access Hollywood, McCarthy, 40, further explained that ""emotions ‚Ä¶ took over"" and her attack on the 18-year-old pop star was all part of living out ""a cougar fantasy maybe.""

Yikes. What's worth noting about this incident is the kind of reaction it has generated.

Performer Pitbull suggested to Access Hollywood that Bieber should count himself lucky to be groped. ""I wish Jenny McCarthy would have touched me like that,"" he said.

Some online commenters echoed the sentiment, even going so far as to question Bieber's sexuality because he did not appear to enjoy it.

As [one commenter put it](http://ca.omg.yahoo.com/news/jenny-mccarthy-dishes-her-cougar-fantasy-kiss-justin-171833990.html): ""C'mon ‚Ä¶ any straight guy wouldn't be making a face like that if 'attacked' by a hot girl.""

Another added: ""If that isn't the face of a gay dude being kissed by a hottie I don't know what is ‚Ä¶""

Attitudes like these are troubling as they reinforce the misguided notion that hot-blooded men (or in Bieber's case, teen boys) can't possibly be victims of sexual assault perpetrated by women; they're *fortunate* to be attacked. This is one of the reasons that sexual assaults on male victims [tend to be underreported](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21653264) and support for male victims is lacking.""

Have things improved for men?

2020-10-13 03:26:46,New to this sub,"So I have a lot to say. 
First off I just want to say that I'm a trans woman. Yet all my life I feel like I've supported men's rights more than I think I've supported women. I also deal with anxiety so I've always hated that. People recently actually tried to get me banned from a page and took me for a troll because I was arguing against something I thought was sexist. 

The post had something to do with a guy walking out of a bar with his girlfriend who obviously had been really drunk. So this complete stranger (who was a girl) came up and asked who the girl was to him, he told her she was his girlfriend, she asked him if he had a picture. If he could prove that. 
I get the concerns. This just could be a man dragging a woman into his van after he drugged her. But isn't it a bit sexist to just assume that? I understand how it looks and that maybe so many men have done so many terrible things, but why does the entire gender have to suffer for that? I highly doubt this would happen if the genders were switched, a girlfriend walking her drunken boyfriend to their car. So essentially by doing this you're saying ""Heeyyyy no offense but I think you're a rapist/murderer, please do prove evidence to me that you truly know this woman and are not a rapist/murderer"" like I get the concern, but if I was the boyfriend I truly would be so offended. What it's saying is that men as a gender, even if they are doing nothing wrong, are suspected and seen as monsters who walk the night. 

I could go on. How I've supported men all these years. The suicide rate for men is statistically much higher than it is for women. If a man is accused of rape even if proven innocent much of his life will be ruined, however no one takes male rape victims seriously, a woman accused of rape will most often walk free as a bird. Oppositely so if a woman has been caught lying about rape she often won't have any consequences either. 

I'm not saying society is just ruled by women or anything like that. I think both genders have their problems. I could make the same claim for women. But these are obvious problems and that in many cases men are seen as monsters when they aren't always are while women are seen as innocent more even when there is something nasty going on.

Even when you say you support men. To even suggest that sexism against men does exist, you're shunned. 

So with all of this. Being trans. It makes me feel like that mentally to my core that I'm just a man, despite how much I don't want that to be. At the end of the the day I still am who I am though :)

Other transwomen related a better treatment in almost every aspect of their lives, whilst FtM are a vast minority and more likely to regret their transition.

My ideal world would be people not caring about genders, but rather minds, but male disposability is a natural fact, and humankid INSISTS on lending animal behavior while claiming to be superior to animals at the same time, so I may as well beat them in their own game while it lasts.

Even when statistics show that men are more likely to be victims of violent crimes?,"Everywhere on Reddit, people bring up how males are far more likely to be the victim of a violent crime than their female counterparts. My answer is the **warrior mentality**. Men in general are mostly pressurized to face the danger while women in general are pressurized to avoid any danger. In other words, women are **advised** to stay away from danger while men are **bullied** to look directly into the danger. From this, men are significantly larger victims of bullying and this is what causes the ""warrior mentality"" in many people. 

As a result, men are scared to walk alone at night if the area is unknown or known for being unsafe. Whereas women have this fear no matter how safe the area is. I live in a pretty safe city so most of us feel very safe here. Many of my male friends tell my how they walked 2 miles home from the pub or a friends house at 2AM on multiple occasions. Many of my female friends on the other hand would never dare to walk outside by themselves after 9PM. Women are also bullied into thinking that they're inferior to men, but I'll save that for another post.",1.0,1.0,1.0,57.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ja5g9t/why_are_women_more_afraid_of_walking_alone_at/,autumn_phenomenon

I don't understand how not wanting to wear a skirt is toxic at all. A skirt is mainly a woman's clothing item and there for is  feminine clothing item and as some one who is a masculine dude it doesn't fit my style nor would look good on me. She basically acted as if it is 100% men's fault. I would rather wear a skirt around all my guy friends and even random dudes then any woman in the entire Earth.

2020-10-14 00:10:12,Men have to embrace the fact we are stronger as a gender,"Men have to embrace our role as being stronger than women and traditionally have more power in society if we are to address this horrific modern day crisis of young adult men being sidelined by society and treated like garbage. 

The reason for feminism is to try and make men feel bad for being more powerful...and at the same time trying to glorify women's natural beauty and to ensure all the attention is brought onto them. 

But this is a great deception brothers...the truth is that women might be just as smart as men, they might be just as intuitive...but they do not have a the same drive and ambition to be great that we do...and so they must suppress our natural urges towards this...they have to try and cull our natural tendencies towards brotherhood and heroism because they don't instinctively understand it. We are the ones who pick the objects off the tallest shelves. We are the ones who open the pickle jars that women can't open. We are the ones who have to pick up our baseball bats and go downstairs in the dark of the night while the woman sits in bed, shivering and frightened and the man goes to hunt down any threats in his home. 

Men, do not be afraid of your natural strength...embrace it! If you embrace the very things the feminists tell you that you must suppress, then you find more women than ever are attracted to you...because it is these things that women do not hate, but are JEALOUS of. They are jealous of our strength, and our drive and our rationality.

Do I say this out of hatred of women? Of course not...I've never hated a woman in my life...no what I hate is WEAKNESS...and modern day women are intent on keep men as weak, as addicted to Onlyfans garbage and sidelined from society and politics and as economically disenfranchised as possible to shore up her own fragile self-esteem.

2020-10-14 00:38:14,A way for equality... Should some of us leave?,"This... Sounds admittedly harsh at first, yet it is not founded in hate. This sub seems to agree, males are being forgotten at best. White men in particular are experiencing targeted shame to create social change. Is some of this deserved... honestly maybe. What happened in the past while not uncommon for human history was certainly grotesque. Yet as some refuse a form of equality, harsher equity tactics are used. 

Going forward though...I don't think the marginalized groups will magically forgive anytime soon. We already see America will become more racially diverse. Females are becoming a significant influence in all aspects of life. Again, these aren't necessarily bad.. I think everyone should have a equal chance at their own dream. The Social Justice movements will always be fighting for equality. This will indeed mean 'taking' from that white patriarchy. We know the demands of breadwinning and such will not go away...

Here's the point.. It's not natural for any group to surrender power and resources. While altruism is great in theory, few are actually benefiting to the point of 'having too much.' So this is about to be a very painful time for many white men. The balance of power tipping point imho was crossed.  As they are intentionally taken away from success and the societal demands of success continue, the result is extreme mental anguish. Many don't care, because somehow today's white man must atone for his ancestors.

So.. Going forward will there need to be a form of acceptance and submission, a humbling experience to say the least? Sure. But what if instead of staying in America and feeling the shame and pain.. Why not just leave? Go international where the apparently eternal American white shame isn't there constantly. And by leaving, we are just opening up opportunities for the minority groups. We found our opportunity in America. For those of us who marginally can say they made it to freedom and success, is it time to step aside? Yet by going international we can still focus on growth. I don't have to worry about how my successes would be perceived. Would I still face prejudices.. Sure. But it's not for my race, ancestors, or gender. I will appreciate what my ancestors have left for me, and taught. Now it's time to be respectful as I go from an American Man, to an International Man. 

I share this for discussion. It.. helped me accept what's going on right now.",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jah2r0/a_way_for_equality_should_some_of_us_leave/,Fledgling_Moose

2020-10-14 05:43:30,Outcast at school for having a different opinion.,"This was a few years back in grade 8. Our teacher (let's call her MS Blue) was teaching a lesson on discrimination. It's normal stuff like the exploitation of the natives, and racism. 

Anyways, MS Blue would frequently bring up the wage gap. Like, an un-normal amount of times. Towards the end of the lesson, we were asked to share our opinion on how people have been discriminatory throughout the years. When I was asked on my opinion, I told Ms Green how constant she would bring up the wage gap, and how it has been debunked many times. I also started explaining how many of ment problems have been forgotten as femisism grew.

While I was explaining my points, MS Green asks me to stop talking and let her finish her lesson. As the bell rang and I was heading outside, Ms Green called me towards her desk to ""have a talk"". She said that hate speech was not tolerated because non of my point had any proof (BTW she cut me off while I was explaining). She told me to put more research into my thought's before talking, and gave me detention that day. Sadly though, that was not the worst of it.

Rumors started spreading around school that I was a ""rasict prick that hated women"". I tried to tell people what actually happened but they would always seem to give me a look of disgust and would not listen. It seemed like everyone at school was taught to believe popular opinion, and eventually I was forced to stop trying to defend myself. 

Throughout the year as rumors kept spreading and became more and more disqusting, I became an outcast. My friends started hanging out with me less and less, MS Green seemed to always ignore my hand during lessons, and eventually I was forced to step down from the student council. 

Luckily however, I was able to find some other kids that had the same ideas as me. We all eventually became friends, and still hang out 4 years later. 
This is not my hate towards the femisist community, I think all of there ideas and goals are deserved. However, I still wish that people could listen before making an opinion.

2020-10-14 06:17:28,Women who make false rape allegations should be sent to prison. For life.,"Yes, I'm a woman. And yes, I think there's a lot of evil women out there. We're living in the #MeToo era and it has become hip to falsely accuse random celebrities of rape. Such allegations can have incredibly negative impact on people and the ones making these claims should be legally punished. If you're famous, everyone will hate you and you will lose all of your supporters. If you're not famous, even worse. You probably won't have the financial status required for you to hire lawyers and protect yourself legally, in which case you're almost guaranteed to go to jail.  How should we tackle such cases? Rape is clearly a horrible act and I am absolutely against mistreating or ignoring rape victims, but how do we actually know which side is lying? I have actually been thinking about this for a few years now and it has become a poignant topic that I like to discuss and hear people talk about.

What triggered me even more is that a few days ago I discovered that one of my favorite musicians was accused by a woman, saying that he had tried to rape her. We know nothing about this woman and she refuses to put out her real name, making anonymous claims. Recently, I have found another source (which is pretty much conspiracy at this point, a website writing ""blind items"" about random celebrities) which claims that this musician slept with a lot of underage girls and even used to rape and beat these girls. The only thing that doesn't add up is that no one ever went out of their way to make these accusations under a real name. All we have are anonymous sources. Also, said musician has been dead for more than two decades so guess he's an easy target?

If you want to accuse someone of raping you, you shouldn't be allowed to make anonymous accusations. Not only that you lose all credibility, but it's also impossible to prove whether the allegations are true or not. It breaks my heart that so many men, famous or not, are falsely accused of rape everyday. A lot of them end up in prison. While being INNOCENT.

2020-10-14 11:05:35,Where did all of this man hate come from?,"I am currently 26, I started noticing strange behavior from women from a young age as I was always an observant person. But I feel like I didn't start to really see the stuck up ""empowered female"" man hating stuff until about maybe 3 or 4 years ago. Maybe I didn't experience it much because I was young, and now that i'm older i'm ""fair game"" but it really pisses me off how women act like they are so damn tough and often treat men like disposable crestures that aren't as important as they are. I have noticed on several occasions women teaming up to try to shun men or shame them, or simply to help out a fellow woman as the expense of a man. I feel like the media especially has been pushing a feminist agenda. And there is so little attention drawn to this issue as if it doesn't exist but occasionally you will see women that admit it. This system simply caters to womemn, even if its not right and often at the expense of men. And the most disturbing part about this is that women are fully aware of this (obviously) and yet 99.9% choose to just ride the wave and reap all the benefits that comes with their gender and stay silent about the privilege. I have had personal experiences where a female made false accusations about me, and tried to turn people at work against me, why is that? Of all the things a person can say about someone, why do women always go for the victim card? Its because thats the easiest trick in the book for them to pull. They will risk their own reputations just to spite a guy and try to destroy them. I'm getting really sick of this.

The VP won‚Äôt encourage them to work with me. So I‚Äôm left here waiting until the VP will fire me for not being a ‚Äúteam player.‚Äù

I do investigations for employment and harassment. I know how this goes. The VP will let me go eventually saying that I was ineffective in the role. I just took this job a year ago.

2020-10-15 07:56:07,Mainstream media has allowed Women to over victimize themselves to their own benefit,"Now I‚Äôm gonna try and not make this political too. But on mainstream (mostly leftist) media I notice they always are super eager to claim someone a victim. They often do it with Women the most, among others like Latinos and African Americans. They also use general terms to spread this gender gap fallacy. Yes, I will agree a gender gap does exist in certain scenarios, but it is not universal and isn‚Äôt something you can just generalize. Gender gap constitutes of multiple factors, as the great Jordan Peterson has said, and gender is just one of them. Other factors include agreeableness, fear of stereotypes, and often times it‚Äôs just because they don‚Äôt want to work in that field which causes huge statistical differences. Legally, men and women are equal(maybe not in family courts though....). I don‚Äôt see men posting on social media for sympathy, yet I always see women constantly playing victim to get attention and make their lives easier. Life isn‚Äôt always fair and you can‚Äôt always play the victim card. When a man gets forced to pay 18 years worth of child support (slavery IMO) I don‚Äôt see them victimizing themselves. Women can share their feelings without fear of embarrassment, and if anything, can use that as a ploy. They can accuse someone of rape without evidence and still ruin their lives. They can get parental leave and not be ridiculed. They are idolized in times of war, while men are sacrificed. Yet the moment anything doesn‚Äôt benefit them, they play victim and whine about privilege.

2020-10-15 09:49:11,Women's history of false rape claims not allowed into evidence!,"You got that right, at the end of last month the High Court of Australia, the highest court in the land,  confirmed a man accused of rape cannot present evidence to the jury that his accuser has a history of making false rape claims.

[https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/prior-false-complaints-cannot-be-admitted-in-nsw-rape-trial-court-rules-20200703-p558qp.html](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/prior-false-complaints-cannot-be-admitted-in-nsw-rape-trial-court-rules-20200703-p558qp.html)

In this 'doozy' it was his ex partner - apparently feminist laws that prevent a man from producing evidence of his accuser's sexual history. (Eg. it's clearly irrelevant, you know, she was a stripper in a men's club, she frequently performed sex acts with men in a private room for money, and he'd just paid her for a private room and blowjob and then she'd cried 'rape').

But not only can't the defence present evidence about her sexual history - highly relevant to a jury deciding the element of consent one would have thought - but they can't even provide evidence that she is a liar making repeated false allegations of being a rape victim.

There are several types of Domestic Violence:

\- Unidirectional (one way violence), Bidirectional (basically combat), Self-defensive violence, non self-defensive violence, Male on Male, Male on Female, Female on Male, Female on Female, etc.

However, when we hear about Domestic Violence, the focus is usually on one type: the man is the perpetrator, and the female is the victim (heterosexual couple). **So, thanks to the Feminist monopoly on victimization, in public discourse, Domestic Violence usually means: Male on Female non self-defensive violence (minor or severe).** 

We very rarely hear about Gay Men being the victims of Domestic Violence.

I feel there are very few resources at the disposal of Gay Men and funding is a huge problem too.

To my knowledge, in North America, there are no shelters specifically for gay men who are victims of domestic violence. Is that correct?

So I believe that we have to stand together with Gay Men, when it comes to Domestic Violence.",1.0,1.0,1.0,15.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jbf77d/who_is_talking_about_domestic_violence_against/,Cryptolexicon

2020-10-16 03:28:56,The Modern Age of Dating for Men: An Observation by a Single Man,"***DISCLAIMER: THIS IS MY OPINION. Of course you can disagree and of course there are exceptions to any argument. I am simply wanting to post my thoughts. So if you want data, please search it on your own. This is NOT a research paper or survey and I have not claimed it to be. This is a culmination of one man's experience with dating apps and his own personal evolution in his own thoughts. Thank you.***

In my opinion, the current dating scene now is a total and utter shitshow. Most of it has shifted to online and it is now basically a free for all, nobody gives a shit, anything goes, market. This applies to both females and males. It's basically a hookup culture.

And for me the red pill realization truly shed light on why the online dating scene is so frustrating and dehumanizing for men over a period of time. The main reason being that many men don't realize just how useless the entire process is no matter how much ""game"" you have because in the end, almost every single girl (80%) are all basically shooting for that top 10% of guys on the apps aka the guy who is most physically desirable (over 6ft, abs, etc.)

The remainder of the pool is then also saturated with beta simps who are basically handing over cash and putting all these women on pedestals. So this leaves guys like me wondering, wtf am I doing here? Not only is this a toxic environment, it's a losing game overall.

Think about it for just a second. This basically equates to the fact that then 80% of girls who btw are NOT the top 10% of women in terms of physical attraction are all shooting for the top 10% of the men on the app.

We all know that men have no problem sleeping with girls that are not their level of physical attractiveness, as to these types of top tier men have so many options at their disposal, so this then in turn explains why so many of the mid to even lower level physically attractive women suddenly wake up to a false realization that they are also just as desirable and entitled to the same benefits as a top tier woman since the top tier men had a one nighter with them.

In addition, this continues a vicious cycle in which the women then go on TikTok or some other social platform complaining that ""all men are shit"" whereas, in fact they are referring to the top tier men who basically hit it and quit it.

Seriously though, you're chasing a fuccboi and expecting a prince? Like wtf?

That's like me expecting a stripper to actually cuff me after buying lap dances?

How fucking stupid is this logic?

Here's a link to a video that explained it for me:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKZEXzinGL0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKZEXzinGL0)

And if you think my post is simply being ""misogynistic"", here's a video of a woman laying it out for other females:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnVUiL9GqA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XrnVUiL9GqA)

After the explosion of social media, we basically became a very hyperphysical world. Pictures more and more dictated our worth and slowly our values and character became secondary to physical features. Fast forward today to swipe culture.

When I first started to go online and go on dates, I asked girls what it was like on the other side of online dating and they often said, ""omg, it's fucked up. They like ask you to come over right away and/or ask for nudes."" This literally stunned me at first but later after doing some research and reading more about MGTOW, I realized this all makes sense in the long run because if a girl shoots her shot with a top tier dude, he ALREADY has 20 other girls who matched with him that day asking him to come over. He has a virtual buffet of girls wanting to basically fuck him so what does he have to lose by being rude or hyperaggressive?

Also, on the flip side, because of the schools of beta simps in these online dating apps, women have started to also cultivate a culture of entitled norms. Hey, if I'm physically hot, (which by the way also applies to ONLY a small percentage as it does to men therefore most women thinking this way are TOTALLY overrating their physical and sexual value) I can demand this +this + this+ etc... If not, then I'll just move on to the next.

And just like that, ONLY fans was born.

Dating apps have become basically a fuccboi buffet or a simp army recruitment center.

Overall, I have to say that after exploring what MGTOW had to offer it has truly opened my eyes and made me realize just how the Red Pill is definitely real. I realized that rather than sit here and complain about the situation like a beta simp, it really came down to two choices.

Either I spend my time more productively and rewardingly by bettering myself which is always a winning investment (MGTOW) AND eventually attract only those who truly want to be with me or I can continue to degrade myself on these losing apps begging for attention and become more bitter and desperate. I choose the first option and I haven't looked back since.

As of today, I am completely date app free and I am so much happier for it. My bank account thanks me as well.

The main purpose of this post was simply to help anyone that feels the same way in that you are not alone in feeling this way.  And for those of you who disagree, I'm happy you have found your happiness through a different path as well.

2020-10-16 05:38:36,Where am I?,"I don‚Äôt know how I stumbled upon here, but I‚Äôve read through some of the stuff and I‚Äôm confused. I am not aiming to stoke anything but just a conversation. 

So I‚Äôm a man.  Let‚Äôs get that out of the way. 

I think it is absurd this notion of ‚Äúmen‚Äôs rights.‚Äù  I think it is more appropriate to label this movement as ‚Äúmen‚Äôs privilege.‚Äù  Let me explain. 

What ‚Äúrights‚Äù are men denied? I‚Äôm a bit confused. Men (though not *all* men, this is where race comes into play) have never had any *particular* right denied in the U.S. or any liberal democracy. Men (again, not *all* men) have always had the right to vote and own property.  Also, men have equal rights in the bill of rights. So what exactly are the ‚Äúrights‚Äù denied to men? 

By contrast, women *only* gained the right to vote a little over a hundred years ago. Women did not generally have property rights (indeed, women were once considered *property* of men). So when comparing *rights*, it is absurd to say that men have been denied rights. 

Instead, it seems like the contention is on *privilege*. But then it is disingenuous to say that the movement is about ‚Äúmen‚Äôs rights.‚Äù  

I‚Äôve seen that there are many grievances of accusations of rape. But again, that does not implicate some particularized right. People, regardless of gender, are accused *all the time* for many things.  But that doesn‚Äôt mean men are denied *rights*. Every American, male or female, are accorded due process rights, and that includes a right to a fair trial. If you think it is unfair that men can have their lives ruined by accusations alone, sure that is a crummy situation. But that is true of *anyone*. Women can have their lives ruined by baseless accusations as well. But that‚Äôs a function of our sensationalist media, which doesn‚Äôt implicate any *rights*.  Go read the Federal Rules on Evidence and see how seriously our *courts* treat evidence for conviction and what kinds of things are excluded. So I really don‚Äôt see why this argument about rape implicates *rights*.

The only thing that may implicate rights I suppose is the notion of parental rights. I think the courts have an antiquated view that women are better caregivers and so are privileged when it comes to gaining custody. But why do courts think that? That‚Äôs a product of the fact that women were legally unable to work and were the primary caregivers. That view is a holdover from a situation where women were denied rights. 

Now if the contention is that men are being denied certain privileges men used to enjoy, then I understand the movement intellectually. But those are *privileges*. White people lost the privilege of sitting at the front of the bus because Black people were accorded their proper rights. If a white person complains about not being able to sit at the front of the bus because a black person has an equal right to sit there, then I would laugh that person out of the room.  That sounds ridiculous. When weighing rights vs privileges, rights will always win. 

Of course, I‚Äôm not saying that there aren‚Äôt real deep problems with our current gender situation. There are, but I think those are, again, independent of rights.  I really like an argument in the book ‚ÄúThe Closing of the American Mind‚Äù that states that the sexual revolution actually was harmful. I agree that it was, but that has nothing to do with *rights*. I have friends who complain that they can‚Äôt find ‚Äúgood and pure girls‚Äù and yet will sleep around with as many women as possible. Sounds like a self-fulfilling prophecy to me. 

I hope this is intelligible and provokes some thought.  As someone in the legal field, I really don‚Äôt understand the premise of the movement and it sounds intellectually dishonest.",1.0,1.0,1.0,109.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jbww7c/where_am_i/,restatementtorts

2020-10-16 09:03:06,My girlfriend is a feminist and sometimes I'm sick and tired of her opinions.,"*I'll start with little note, I'm not interested about your opinion on if you think that I should or should I not date this person. I just know it will be brought up here.*

I have been brought up in a household where my mom wasn't undepriviledged woman, hasn't suffered with any amounts of toxic masculinity, didn't suffer from patriarchy, hasn't been influenced by men in politics, she was her own person who had hobbies, friends and goals.

She was a role model of a woman without any bullshit. Someone I admire. She taught me how to treat a women and to be who I am today.

But oh my god; my girlfriend just pushes all these patriarchical issues down my throat. Now I always thought I'm liberal but ever since we started dating and the conversation started expanding I'm finding out that I'm conservative as fuck. 

It's not I'm being mean to her, It's not that I want her to do anything against her will...It's about WOMEN rights and her opinion is always right because goddamn patriarchy. I'm not saying that women are not in form victims of rape and sexism and I tend to support her and firmly believe that there are things that should be discussed.

But when it comes to certain problems I just cannot grasp the relevancy. For example she is utterly conviced that Hillary Clinton's biggest problem during 2016 election was that she is a woman. USA is country full of sexist pigs because they are able to vote for Donald Trump. *we are not from US; so these are two topics that some of you might relate to*.

Now she thinks there should be mandatory quota for women in politics up to 50% to reflect gender in population better. (Now we are not from US and the sexism in politics in our country is super small). Then there is matter of language and how some words are sexist (not english). Now there is a thing that really gets me off inside and that is when she tells me that children should be named after a mother.

I like feminism to a point but the more I learn about it then the more I remember who my mom is, who just doesnt give a fuck about any of this and it doesn't make her any less of a woman. She can smear a room with any guy and she doesn't need a special treatment to do so.  

I don't want to vilify my girlfriend she's an amazing person who's not afraid to stand up for men's rights too but I kind of wish she could be her own bad-ass person without the need to always stand up for ""im right"" movement.",1.0,1.0,1.0,143.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jc07jg/my_girlfriend_is_a_feminist_and_sometimes_im_sick/,It_was_mee_all_along

2020-10-16 11:20:30,Striking Similarities Between Contemporary Feminist Judicial Practice and the Salem Witch Trials.,"&amp;#x200B;

[ Liam Neeson Called The #MeToo Movement A 'Bit Of A Witch Hunt'.](https://preview.redd.it/2eopas64edt51.jpg?width=5150&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae347c56aa38858f3a612a4bf5e63ae82542e34d)

**There is a number of similarities between judicial practice during the Salem witch trials and contemporary Feminist Judicial practice:**

\- Judicial practice shaped by **non-judicial dogma** (Feminism) or popular sentiment.

\- Judicial susceptibility to implicit bias arising from non-judicial dogma or popular sentiment. 

\- Judicial predisposition to automatically believe accusations consistent with non-judicial dogma or popular sentiment: ""I Believe the Woman."" ""Women do not lie about Rape.""

\- Diminished judicial protection of due process rights of the accused.

\- Judicial perception of defendants as members of a scorned outgroup (feminist monopoly of victimization).

\- Judicial skepticism towards claims of innocence. 

\- Judicial indifference to the suffering of innocent defendants.

**Judicial practice influenced by any extra-judicial dogma or popular sentiment is an immoral enterprise.** When a judge deviates from the Constitution, law, due process and verifiable facts the risk of harming innocent people increases. Consequently judges must be forever vigilant. Judges who cannot divorce themselves from extra-judicial dogma or popular sentiment should leave the bench. They can be activists as lawyers. They should not be activists as judges.

Historically, #MeToo isn't the first time judges have denied legal protections, abused discretion, misused procedure and operationalized non-judicial dogma and popular sentiment.

# What happened during the Salem Witch Trials?

https://preview.redd.it/ymu3tu04fdt51.jpg?width=715&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=dd3daf4d3becd7525ffeb4cdf08394a7ea872514

Puritanism was the religion of the Massachusetts colony. 

It had no tolerance for any other religion. 

From February 1692 through May 1693 a series of trials were held in Salem, Massachusetts. 

More than 200 innocent people were falsely accused of witchcraft, 28 were convicted and 20 were executed. Several more died in custody. There are at least 10 ways judges enabled these crimes against humanity:

\- **Judges did not limit their work to law and procedure.** Instead they were heavily guided by the non-judicial dogma of Puritanism **(as today judicial practice is guided by the non-judicial dogma of Feminism)**. As Kathryn Wesley notes, ""The judges were here to confirm their own religiosity."" (Wesley, Kathryn (2002). Salem Witch Trials. New York: Pocket Books, at p. 259).

\- Judges were to be neutral arbiters of law, procedure and fact. As Gail Stewart notes, ""While the magistrates were supposed to examine the prisoners in a neutral manner, it was evident from the beginning judges were convinced of the defendant's guilt."" (Stewart, Gail B. (2013). The Salem witch trials. San Diego, CA: Reference Point Press at p. 39).

https://preview.redd.it/v3kqy5wjidt51.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a646fce7ea06ea403d1bf2b518c67a1cf64e9f3e

\- Judges were informed by physician ""experts"" who testified the accusers were under an evil spell. (Stewart, Gail B. (2013). The Salem witch trials. San Diego, CA: Reference Point Press at p. 8).

\- Judges imposed dire consequences on anyone who did not confess to being a witch. If defendants confessed they were spared. If not, they were sentenced to death. As defendant Margaret Jacobs reported, ""They told me if I would not confess I would be hanged, but if I would confess I should save my life."" (Uschan, Michael V. (2004). The Salem Witch Trials. Milwaukee, WI: World Almanac Library, at p. 26).

\- Judges coerced false confessions from innocent people. As Rice describes, ""Judge Hathorne, who had apparently prejudged Sarah, relied heavily on bullying tactics to force her confession."" (Rice, Earle (1997). The Salem Witch Trials. San Diego, CA: Lucent Books, at p. 34).

\- Judges were not swayed by declarations of innocence. As Gail Stewart reports, ""Those who were accused of being witches protested their innocence... their pleas did not move the judges."" (Stewart, Gail B. (2013). The Salem witch trials. San Diego, CA: Reference Point Press at p. 8).

https://preview.redd.it/ulcs5papidt51.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e2fd1ca595cf2c410242d53c3b2db0d4e0076a7

\- **Judges welcomed the use of unsubstantiated accusations.** In fact, Chief Justice William Stoughton insisted ""spectral evidence"" be admitted, something demanded by the other judges as well. Spectral evidence is testimony that a defendant's spectral shape appeared to the witness in a dream. **As Starkey notes, ""Thanks to this arrangement, hallucinations, dreams, and mere fancies would be accepted in court as factual proof... of the behavior of the accused.""** (Starkey, Marion L. (1969). The Devil in Massachusetts: A Modern Inquiry Into the Salem Witch Trials. New York: Time Reading Program, at p. 37. This passage is quoted by the New Hampshire Supreme Court in State v. Dustin 81-182 at 551). **Read what I wrote about the Feminist memory therapy scandal, during which false implanted memories were accepted as factual proof in court:** [https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/iiat8h/judicial\_abuse\_against\_men\_never\_forgive\_never/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MGTOW/comments/iiat8h/judicial_abuse_against_men_never_forgive_never/)

As Michael Uschan adds, ""People were convicted simply because others said they saw specters of the accused."" (Uschan, Michael V. (2004). The Salem Witch Trials. Milwaukee, WI: World Almanac Library, at p. 23).

\- Judges went through the motions of a trial but as Kallen notes, **""The defendants were presumed guilty before their trials even began.""**",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jc28uo/striking_similarities_between_contemporary/,Cryptolexicon

2020-10-16 13:37:28,Why are MEN CONSIDERED TRASH?,"Why is it, that of all the groups in society, men are always the evildoers, or at best neutral, never the ones who got shortchanged, hardly done by etc?  I had a recent exchange with a self-described 'trans man' new to this subreddit, and immediately I didn't agree with her she started with the ""I'm the real victim here"" game.

We as men absolutely NEVER get to do this.

I have custody of my daughter and, since she was about five, I have possessed a pink suit, now I'm getting fatter and the clothes are getting worn, it's just a pink jacket.  Whenever I wear this people assume I'm a homosexual, and treat me like gold.  Literally, I can pick her up from school one day, wearing 'normal man's clothes', and get nasty looks of suspicion or just general derogation, and the next day with my 'magic pink jacket' everything 'clicks' in their heads - no wife, no girlfriend, no nasty custody struggle, oh gayboy.  And as if by magic, these female teachers start treating me like gold.

They start EMPATHISING.  I can see it, it's totally obvious - I go from being the 'suspicious man' even though they know I have a current working with children's clearance - to the 'wonderful gay man'.  

This is complete and total bullshit, and it's why I am suspicious of the role of gay men in the movement for men to be given equality with women.  They are one of the 'protected' classes all us nasty straight men are 'oppressing', along with women, 'Indigenous peoples', or whatever they want to add to their long laundry list of 'protected classes'.  The one thing WE KNOW WITH CERTAINTY, is as straight men we will forever be typecast as the evildoers in society, even though we pay most of the tax, bear most of the risks, and do most of the dangerous, hazardous and undesirable job.

If any of you guys are men, I dare you to custom-make an all pink suit and wear it around.  Just see how you get cheated, you will be treated as an 'honorary sister' equal to a woman.   It's a heady feeling, and to think for half the population such decent and fair treatment is their normal daily existence.  

In my case, my problem is I am not a pathological liar, and don't want to represent myself as something I am not - I like the colour pink, and my pink jacket, but I find some male to male practices frankly quite unhealthsome.  

I am also sceptical of the contribution gay men can make to the lot of heterosexual men - they are benefiting from the inequalities the system visits on us.  At the least, I think they need to realise that gay men are hugely privileged vis-a-vis straight men, acknowledge that, and then work literally against their own narrow self-interest so the majority of men who are straight are fairly treated within society.",1.0,1.0,1.0,29.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jc465m/why_are_men_considered_trash/,playingpoodles

I don‚Äôt like it and it is harder now for me to trust users on dating sites while women have no problem at all.

I‚Äôm emotionally damaged and I don‚Äôt ever appreciate being treated this way. It is unfair and degrading. I‚Äôm heartbroken that these scammers discriminate based on biology
and make money off of it. Truly disgusting to think about and it doesn‚Äôt do any good to do it that way.

I use online dating for a large part of my dating life because I work a lot and I‚Äôm home otherwise.

2020-10-16 19:10:45,I think y'all may be confused,"Before I start, I apologise for the rant and I'm not looking to dismiss or diminish anyone's struggles and the discrimination that you face. I am wholly aware of the demonisation of men in media and just, overall, and I empathise and do not hold any bias against men, nor do I accept or tolerate any form of hate towards anyone. I'm sure many of you are lovely people and only mean well, standing up for your rights and the rights of your fellow men, but I've come across some problematic tendencies across this sub as a whole. I merely wish to broaden your view so you can have a fuller, more understanding take on any gender based issues. Men and women have been divided for quite some time and I wish to try and unite everyone, so I've tried to educate myself on both mens and womens rights.

First off, feminists (TRUE feminists) aren't against men. They are for equality, not superiority. Unfortunately, it has seemingly morphed and developed into man-hating femi-nazis. This isnt feminism and, as a feminist, it would be appreciated if people would stop associating those types of people with feminism. (real feminists would stick up for everyone btw, the only reason they are more focused on womens issues is because women have been oppressed for hundreds and hundreds of years).

Now, i know most of you think you're oppressed and, while i agree with most, if not all the issues on this sub and the difficulties men face, it doesn't quite compare to the issues that women face. I apologise if I offend anyone, but I'm not quite sure how else to put it. I'm not trying to diminish these issues, I understand that men obviously face struggles and I agree that they should be confronted and solved, but there is a way to confront issues without tearing down women and women's rights. Many of the posters on this sub seem to forget that women experience struggles too, and with a collection of complete scumbags flooding the sub, I'm afraid that it could skew your perception of women. Just because an asshole is a woman, does not mean that all women are like that. Just as a man raping a woman doesn't make all men rapists, a woman accusing a man of rape does not make all women liars.

I think it would greatly benefit everyone if everyone were educated on both mens and womens issues as well. This includes acknowledging male privilege, I understand that it can be hard to recognise that you have privilege when you've never experienced what its like to not have it.

I'm aware that men are discriminated against, especially in work places involving children and I agree that this is wrong and needs to be fixed, however many of you don't seem to acknowledge the discrimination against women in almost everything, from female athletes not even making a fraction of what their male counterparts make, to women constantly being passed up for jobs and promotions simply because they are female.

Male privilege also includes just general safety. Most, if not all the women i know face or have faced sexual harassment, I can't go anywhere alone, or even with friends, without fearing for my safety, and femicide (brutalisation and murder of women solely based on their gender) still rages on in many many countries.

Everyone faces struggles and I'm not denying men's issues or trying to say that mens issues are less important, but I'm asking you, as a human being, to educate yourselves, to stand up for mens and womens rights, to be kind to your fellow human beans, to not limit your view on women to just false rape allegations and man-haters. This is dangerous and furthers the divide between genders. You can never have equality until everyone is on the same side. No progress can come from shitting on men or women or fuelling your hate by defining a whole gender by a few shitty people. All im asking is to reconsider your view on the opposite gender, learn about their issues, and once everyone is aware and everyone cares, we can finally make progress and fix everything wrong with the world. Thank you for coming to my ted talk, this took an embarrassingly long time to type and I will be writing¬† similar ones on other hate-fuelled subs if this gets any kind of response.

2020-10-17 06:09:19,A discussion/poll about Leadership and Assholes,"Hello gents, 

I'll not burden you with all the little details, but I had an interesting discussion today with a person who ""didn't see a difference between MRAs and Feminism"" when it comes to disavowing assholes.

My argument on the matters is that Feminism seems to adopt every ally it can, whether it's useful tools like Emma Watson or categorical manhaters such as Valerie Solanas, casually turning a blind eye to manhaters within its ranks while also allowing subcommunites such as TERFs to fester under the same banner as feminism.

Their argument was that the MensRights reddit in particular does not disavow assholes, and that women hate is rife within our ranks.

I brought up the point that Paul Elam is seen by some as a Leader in the MensRights arena, while many MRAs disavow Elam for his more controversial statements and points. To wit, they demanded proof. 

So here's a poll for you all. Naturally, not everyone's opinion is going to fit neatly into a binary choice, so please contribute in the comments as well regarding your stance on MRA Leadership. 

I'm also curious to hear whether or not you think MensRights has a woman hating problem (to the same degree as Feminism's man hating problem).

You don't have to find it funny for it to be funny. And unless you're leaving out details about your friends like that they're demigods, don't think you have to worry about them following through.  
No, we don't hate men - not even those of us who say stuff like ""kill all men"" - but we do hate the constant oppression that the patriarchial society puts on us and yeah sometimes it's funny to think that we could kill all men, live without male oppression, but we just don't cuz we're nice or something.

If the person is Republican-leaning:
Simply say that circumcision is a Jewish conspiracy propagated by the liberals to destroy the nuclear family.

Then you can reference Galatians 5:2  where people who are circumcised will ‚Äúfind Christ of no value to [them]‚Äù, which undermines Christian values furthers the Jewish order.

If the person is Democrat-leaning:
Say that circumcision is a backwards practice supported by anti-vax Republicans and that it was the first step to Conservatives having control over people‚Äôs bodies (and that women‚Äôs bodies are already in danger, see:abortion) and you can likely reference the same bible quote, but instead of Jewish conspiracy, you can simply say that ‚ÄúRepublicans are anti-Christ‚Äù or something like that.

2020-10-18 05:42:44,"I was raped, robbed, and told I was the criminal","This happened 4 years ago when I was living in Charleston, SC.
I lived a couple blocks from a bar that would often go to. One night I drank way more than I should have and stumbled back home. It was only a couple of blocks so I didn't think much about drinking too much. On the way back I remember talking to some people on the way. I was pretty far gone so everything was just snip-its of the night.
I opened the door to my house and a woman pushed her way in with me. I remember asking her something but after that it's a complete blank until she is on top of me. After that it was a complete blank again.
I woke up and pretty much had forgotten about the whole evening until I realized my phone, ipad, and wallet were gone. At that point the parts I could remember came back and I realized what had happened, she took my shit.
I went to my neighbors and cancelled all my cards. I then tracked the transactions on my computer and could track her to the motel she checked in at on my card so I called the police.
An officer came over and I explained the situation and the motel she was at. He asks me for a description so I tell him what I remember.  After I tell him he tells me he knows who it probably was. Sweet, I think, he is gonna get this asshole. Nope. He tells me she is a known prostitute and if she says I tried to hire her I'm going to jail.
Awesome, a criminals word against mine. He told me to just drop it and try to dispute my credit cards for my own good. Well I did and that was that. It sounded like too much to deal with.
Imagine a woman was hammered and a man followed her into her house, had sex with her and then stole her stuff. It would be a completely different reaction and outcome. People laughed and made fun of me when I told them what happened. Got raped and robbed, all a big joke because that doesn't happen to men. The culture right now seems to agree that men consent to sex no matter what condition they are in.
I want men and women to agree on what consent is and have the same rules across the board. This isn't male versus female. This is us versus them. This is everyone (all genders) versus the sexual predators.  
That experience bothers me still and no one takes me seriously on it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,71.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jd3syr/i_was_raped_robbed_and_told_i_was_the_criminal/,porkeddonkey

2020-10-19 03:49:01,Believing Women All The Time is a Subversion of Due Process and a Desecration of Justice.," 

[Believe All Women, All the Time.](https://preview.redd.it/vd3h5wcjqwt51.jpg?width=1600&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=48031b05124dc4ecef7b58f892b6114cd8999551)

Feminists always take the side of any female accusing any male (Except Tara Reade).

**The stern admonition to ""Believe All Women"" (even if we know they might be lying) is part of a structured and coordinated effort to Victimize all Women and establish a monopoly on victimization. Over the years, this has proven to be a very successful fundraising strategy.**

Amber Tamblyn says ""There are not two sides to every story."" (Tamblyn, Amber (2017). I'm done with not being believed. New York Times, Sep 16 2017).

**The senior prosecutor in England, Alison Saunders, urges police to automatically believe female accusers. Thus, the top English prosecutor is telling police to adopt a guilty until proven innocent perspective.**

It is worth noting that many of Saunders' automatic assumption of rape prosecutions have fallen apart for lack of evidence, contradictory testimony, or admissions of making false accusations. England recently notified Saunders that her contract will not be renewed (Montgomery, Jack (2018). England's top prosecutor stepping down after 'guilty until proven innocent' rape trials. Breitbart, Apr 03 2018).

Interestingly, Sarah Thornton, head of the UK National Police Chief's Council directly opposed Alison Saunders, saying it is a mistake to believe an accuser is an actual victim from the outset of the investigation. **Thornton believes police officers have become too eager to immediately believe alleged victims** ( Wright, Paul (2017). Police chief tells forces to not automatically believe 'victims' in sex abuse cases. International Business Times, Dec 21 2017).

Attorney Zerlina Maxwell argues that even if innocent men are accused, the greater good is to always believe female accusers. (See Sexton, John (2014). Zerlina Maxwell's plea to 'automatically' believe rape accusers turns the justice system on its head. Breitbart, Dec 09 2014).

Danielle Campoamor says if accusers are not automatically believed ""we tell women they are not people, they're property."" (Campoamor (2015). What happens when we don't believe rape victims. Huffington Post, Dec 06 2017).

Hillary Clinton says all accusers deserve ""to be heard, believed, and supported."" (Clinton, Hillary (2015). Post on Twitter. Nov 23 2015).

Evette Dionne says ""They aren't lying."" (Dionne, Evette (2016). Five reasons sexual assault victims who speak out should always be believed. The Revelist, Apr 04 2016).

https://preview.redd.it/zf0xxlxkqwt51.jpg?width=618&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=17968741056c3403d1fd4d5492e7f648ec664e06

Daphne Merken

**Daphne Merken** notes the tension of being required to always believe, yet knowing some accusations are probably false. ""Publically, we say #MeToo. Privately, we have misgivings... I suspect many of us, including many longstanding feminists, will be rolling our eyes, having had it with the reflexive and unnuanced sense of outrage... turning this into a series of ad hoc and sometimes unproven accusations."" (Merkin, Daphne (2018). Publically, we say #MeToo. Privately, we have misgivings. The New York Times, Jan 05 2018).

**Contrary to what Evette Dionne says, many female accusers lie, do so knowingly, lying to get revenge, lying out of jealousy or lying as part of financial extortion:**

\- Four women spent 15 years in prison based upon false accusations by two little girls who were believed. Much later they were proven to be lying. (Associated Press (2016). Texas women known as the 'San Antonio 4' are declared innocent after serving 15 years for child sex crimes they did not commit. Daily Mail, Nov 23 2016).

\- Mary Zolkowski admitted to falsely accusing a man of rape. (Crane, Emily (2018). Michigan student, 21, pleads guilty to lying about being attacked and raped on a college campus. Daily Mail, Mar 28 2018).

\- Latiqwa Mayes falsely accused an innocent man, Donald Robinson, of rape. Latiqwa got a gang of men to beat Donald to death. As he lay dying Latiqwa pepper sprayed Donald. (De Graff, Mia (2014). Woman jailed for six years after she falsely screamed rape. Daily Mail, Nov 01 2014).

\- An unnamed 15 year old girl punched a President Trump supporter in the face, then said he had grabbed her breast. Lucky for the man police video showed the girl was lying. (Unattributed (2016). Cops: Teen girl pepper-sprayed at Trump rally should be charged. Newser, Mar 31 2016).

\- A female Uber passenger told the driver to give her a phone charger, which he didn't have. Furious, she threatened ""I will punch myself in the face and tell the cops you did it."" She also said she would accuse him of rape. Fortunately, the Uber driver recorded this threat. (Campbell, Scott (2017). Aggressive passenger is recorded telling an Uber driver she will falsely accuse him of rape as they argue about a phone charger. Daily Mail, Apr 06 2017).

\[The whole story: Drunken female Deputy District Attorney Shaun Platt verbally abused, and physically attacked an Uber driver who then told her to get out of his car. She threatened to file a false kidnapping report if he did not drive her home. Fortunately the driver recorded Platt's abuse and threats. (This case could have destroyed the male driver, if he had not recorded Platt. Without a recording it would be his word against hers in a world taught to always believe accusing females. There were consequences for Platt because she was caught. She was fired by the District Attorney. See Farberov, Snejana (2017).

Professor Tom Gill from Meiji Gakuin University calls the Japanese Government biased towards men but after that he says how the Government helps women unconditionally, especially those with kids and DOES NOT blame women for their failures. Officially there are 5,168 men and 196 women homeless people in Japan. When men ask for help they are considered alcoholics and bums, his words, not mine ! How is it sexist(his words, not mine) NOT having expectations from someone but helping them if need be ?

2020-10-19 15:47:02,Anybody hate how hypocritical so many women and feminists are when they talk about advocating against toxic masculinity?,"Sorry if this comes off too much like venting and also I suck at grammer also sorry if this long post is too against the rules and you can take it down if it doesn't fit

I've always kinda hated being a man and personally identify more with my anima then how I am in real life. I know that probably sounds really pathetic and I hate myself for it too. But I just wish that more people held any sort of true self accountability. You've probably heard the argument that feminists give all the time: ""feminism helps men more then any other group, ____ and ____ is toxic masculinity. We're the ones changing that, blah blah blah men don't have any real social expectation or pressure to act a certain way."" I have noticed that almost every single one of these people are the same ones to hate on or devalue a man for showing any sort of insecurities. The same ones to call them toxic or weak for hiding their insecurities. I always scroll through these reddit threads on other subs and I just hate just how many of them have no empathy and or awareness to how hypocritical they are being. Just browse r/dating, r/relationship_advice, r/AmITheAsshole, etc. I say this because I noticed it with one of my coworkers, she plays the progressive and ""morally superior"" girl but then when it comes to gossip she's always telling her friends to break up with a man because he showed any sort of emotion to his partner. She will specifically point out that these men not staying traditionally masculine is unattractive and that they dont deserve anything women. Nobody ever calls out this entitlement and unjustified hatred of people just because they aren't masculine. 

I'm so sick of everything. I get it, it's biology, but can't you at least make an effort to change or hide it. Like I'm a naturally stoic and masculine guy anyways but I know how much less suffering I would've gone through if I didn't have to fit into this box to be valued. I feel like and know that if I was born a girl and had the standards of a girl that I would be desirable. I would also be allowed to be the person I want to be without getting shit on by the opposite sex. I think I already knew this subconsciously for years but now that I've started dating it's kind've been an eye opener. I know I shouldn't compromise the inner qualities I want for a lover, I know that if she is the person I want that I won't feel like shit and you guys are gonna say that. And I think I've made my standards of how I want her to look more then low enough just because I know what it's like to be considered unlovable. To feel like you are fated to a life of unavoidable pain and loneliness. Just why does the world have to be so fucked?

I hate to say that at one point I was blind and completely complicit because I've never received any sort of validation from my parents or women or anybody. I would do anything, and I knew that appearing calm and in control and also confident was considered attractive and I fucking hate saying this because I was such a stupid kid. I didn't cry at my grandfather's funeral and he was the only person that has ever truly cared about me. Believe me, on the inside I  conciously knew my light had been blown out but I couldn't fucking feel anything. Please don't try to comfort me because I hate trying to reassure others when I know that I will probably have to lie for them to not feel the need to comfort me. I won't be lying if I didn't say I have gotten over some of these issues, like my social anxiety and controlling apathy. I cried playing a video game a month ago and again it's pathetic that it's the first time I've ever felt comfortable crying to myself in a healthy way or even acknowledging that I'm sad. But hey I did it and I'm finally taking the opportunities I do have :)

Ok now, why tf can women say period cramps and beauty standards are the top most issues when trying to use ""your a man"" to invalidate my experience. Period cramps are horrible and I would hate to have them but at least you aren't socialized into a situation where you've relapsed in depression for all of your ""happy"" years. I should not live in a world where I become isolated and fucked over more for trying to slit my wrists open when others are helped simply because they don't have a penis. And don't get me fucking started on beauty standards. First I'd like to say that most women are on average way more sexy and pretty then the average man is sexy and handsome. I know that you will think that I can be biased because I'm a man and of course I'm gonna think all women are sexy and not every man. But just ask any woman or ask yourself that same question, now consider that beauty is fucking subjectively rated. Women also shouldn't be able to cheat the ladder with sex and psychopathic willingness to figuratively and literally fuck over other people. It breaks my heart. Men rarely have this option, and I mean that sounds bad (from the perspective of gender parity) but I mean it's good that at least that means less people have to suffer through this emotional napalm. Someone told me on the internet some time ago that being an ugly is like being an average man, you can be happy, but you have to work for it. It's never sounded more true to me then right now.

At work today a family came in and it was 2 white assumably  foster parents or maybe the kid was from a previous one of their relationships idk and it's not really that important anyways. But the kid was black so that's why I think it's one of those 2 possibilities. So I took care of everything they needed and at one point the mother said something along the lines of ""aaah why is it illegal to beat your kids."" This made me worry for the kid so much, he came up 2 other times asking for some more and he was really shy. I could see my previous self in him and I felt horrible that I could see him  as the victim in repeating the cycle. I would get off work in about 20 minutes and I really put together everything. He was blind to it and was in the part of the cycle where he didn't yet realize that his parents aren't the supreme figures of godly endowment. That they weren't preparing him for society's judgement. I planned to talk to him in a secluded booth and give him some ice cream I could get once I got off. I would tell him everything I have learned the hard way so he knew how to avoid all this shit but it was too late and I feel fucking horrible that I had to leave him behind like everyone has left me. And he will be left behind because he's a fucking boy and this parenting wouldn't even be a problem if he was born a girl.

I can't even count how many times I've heard somebody say that feminism tries to fix these problems and I appreciate the true feminists who are loving. Almost everyone who says that feminism tries to fight men's problems are usually the main ones reciprocating this culture of silent suffering. Why does society have to leave me in the dust? Why are so many people trapping me in this cage of having to be manly to be loved but also that I'm the enemy for doing so? How do these people consume art without realizing that people like them are the reason why the conflict exists? :'(

I wonder if, once again, the truth is the opposite: is it men who are much more often harmed because of honor reasons?","Think about Godfather. The code of honor was strict, but as far as I can remember it was men who got killed or violently attacked for breaking the code. Yeah, it's a movie, but I suppose it describes reality accurately in this respect. Or perhaps I was thinking about the Sopranos or some other Mafia dramatization. 

""Honor is all our family has"", could be something a poor man in a traditional society could say - or in case of Mafia in a criminal society. And I'm pretty sure he has said it thousands or millions of times. In a traditional society the honor code is what keeps you family or clan tightly together. It gives you ""credit"" that you can turn into alliances and help if something bad happens. 

Most of the time it was men who had to have this ""honor"". They were, after all, the ones that operated outside homes in the unpredictable and often violent world. But women, too, had to have honor in particularly in one sense: they had to be ""saleabe"" in the marriage markets. Marriages were almost always contracts between families, not individuals. If a woman wasn't marriageable a great deal of security and predictability was lost.  

My common sense says that it was men whose honor was challenged and who failed more often. Every day they could end up in situations where they couldn't keep their promise, for example, or show enough courage when protecting the honor of the family. Women just had to follow some pretty simple rules of chaste behavior.

**Where are you?**

&amp;#x200B;

When you first stood up to fight for rights,

Who was it that fought by your side?

&amp;#x200B;

When you first went to vote,

Who was it that gave you hope?

&amp;#x200B;

When you first started going to work,

Who was it who told you not to shirk?

&amp;#x200B;

When you first asked for equal pay,

Who was it that stood with you, come what may?

&amp;#x200B;

When you asked us just to *listen*,

Who was it that made sure you were heard,

And made sure no-one cried out,

‚ÄòShut up, you stupid bird!‚Äô?

&amp;#x200B;

When first you cried out ‚ÄòRape!‚Äô

Trying to ensure your voice hadn‚Äôt quivered,

Who was it fought for you,

And saw justice delivered?

&amp;#x200B;

And now we stand here,

Opposite each other.

We ask you to just *listen*,

Like we would of our mother.

&amp;#x200B;

But do you now stand with us?

Do you now fight with us?

Do you now believe in us?

Do you now even *listen* to us?

&amp;#x200B;

You say you want help,

That you will hear us out.

And yet, when we stand up to speak,

You say we have nothing real to talk about.

&amp;#x200B;

You cast us out, into the cold,

Decried us all as woman-haters.

I can‚Äôt help think, you all seem to be,

Nothing better than dirty traitors.

&amp;#x200B;

You say we hate you, that we are sexist,

But history seems to tell a different tale.

In future years, I always think,

Your argument will seem rather frail.

&amp;#x200B;

That‚Äôs the truth, one can‚Äôt deny,

And so I still wonder why,

&amp;#x200B;

Where are you when we are sent to die?

Where are you when our children cry?

Where are you when our new-born bodies feel the tang?

Where are you when by the neck we hang?

Where are you when about us lies are told?

Where are you when our worlds seem to fold?

&amp;#x200B;

Where are you?

&amp;#x200B;

And then ask yourself,

Where were we, throughout years?

Stood with you, by your side,

Listening to your tears.

&amp;#x200B;

Now its *our* tears that spill from *our* eyes,

But they‚Äôre labelled as hateful lies.

Please Read the Whole Thing before commenting. I'm Pro-Feminists but I believe there is a group of Stupid Psuedo-Feminists who dilute the power of the message of Feminism.


Women tend to shoot themselves in their own foot, someone tell me why alimony favours women in all countries and never non working males? Why do women get priority over men in extreme situations? Why is it alright for a woman to say I can't do that because I'm a girl, it's a man's job. Like WTF if you believe that you are no less than a man then be ready to put in equal work to get the same benefits. I'm a Med Student and I know that pound for pound women and men are equal when it comes to strength. Men just tend to be slightly bigger but not by a big margin. Then why is alright for a girl to say I'm not strong enough I need a man to help me. A huge proportion of feminists are pretty pseudo feminist to be honest they act as if it's a buffet. They'll pick all the good parts of being a man but will leave out all the bad crappy parts. They have to eat the damn veggies if they really want equal status and respect metaphorically speaking. Like WTF is Chivalry and why does it only apply to girls? Like why can't a girl be chivalrous? Why does the man have to do the good gestures and the girl just says thank you. Double Standards should be removed from as many facets of social life as possible. I get when it's there for girls having periods, maternity leave, and other valid biological points but other than that screw it. No double standards. Why is it that a girl can say no to a proposing guy rudely and it's girl power but when a boy does it he's an asshole. Either both are assholes or there is something new called ""boy power"". Why is housewife culture so normalised? It shouldn't be everyone should work. Working gives a sense of independence ms that will earn respect. I don't respect non- working males and females (After their Education of course) irrespective of who they are. Why are these stupid disney princesses made role models for girls. Why the Fuck do you want a male to rescue you? Rescue yourselves! Independent strong female characters are still very rare. I've seen girls saying that Brienne of Tarth and Arya Stark are bad characters. Like WTF what do you want to be? a princess who eats , shits, and bathes in wine and is half covered with gold? If you put your life in a man's hand Don't expect that they will always be good. It's basic human nature which will never change! To Quote APJ Abdul Kalam- former president of India ""Only Power Respects Power!"". Stop Cherry picking and start getting into the real struggle. You won't get all the benefits without all of the shit associated with it!",1.0,1.0,1.0,71.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jeode7/these_pseudofeminists_are_irritating_assholes_and/,KanishkBhattacharya

2020-10-21 02:48:57,"Prolly not the right place to post this, but I got to vent before I explode. Offmychest wouldn't allow it for some reason.","I'm in a bad relationship. My girlfriend is insane when she drinks. I'm always being told to get the f@@@ out of the house (she owns the house), having my stuff broken, sending me hundreds of angry, insulting text messages when I do leave - more often than not I have to go basically drive around and sit in my car until the text messages stop so I know she's passed out. I've been trying to get out of this relationship for a year or so when it came apparent that she wasn't going to stop drinking.

I'm also unemployed. I was a point of sale programmer that did all aspects of it from programming to network troubleshooting to virus removal because fucking idiots would keep plugging their phones into the usb ports on the terminals to charge them. I've spent the time on unemployment learning new shit, like HTML/CSS/JS, got better with SQL etc but recruiters keep ghosting me, I can't find a job, and the only jobs that have offered me anything are in another state and don't offer relocation.

I've got my back to the wall. My unemployments running out, I get treated like shit three or four nights a week and I can't get out. I'm good at what I do. I have numerous client references. I just don't have a CS degree or certs and most hiring managers won't even give me a chance. I can't afford school, I can't afford certs, I can't afford to move. I can barely afford to stay here and listen to her scream about ""Get the f out, all I have to do is call the cops and cry and you'll go to jail"" whenever she's had more than 4 mich ultras then get text messages like ""I can't believe you fn abandoned me you worthless asshole your stuff is in the trash"". ""Stuff"" includes grandads war medals, my military shadowbox, my baseball card collection I've worked on for 20 odd years and other stuff I can't replace.

All I want is a fucking job and to get the fuck out of this situation and back on my feet. I'm great with IT. But no one will hire me because I don't fit into some stupid, archaic requirements checklist and even if I did, they could hire some college graduate for 12 dollars an hour. Until then I'll sit just here and get verbally and emotionally abused because I'm 2000 miles from friends and family with no where to go . Sure, I could go down and get a job at walmart or a gas station but I can't afford to move out on my own with that salary

In general, they have been the most influential group in the progress that has been made for mens rights. I think that every one of us should include some trans rights into our book of mens rights issues. A few easy ones are that because of the discrimination against men in mental and physical health, MtF people have a harder time getting support from family members and approval from doctors than FtM. FtM on the other hand are focused on far less after transitioning because of their status as men. In conclusion, take care of our trans allies.

Misogyny is also wrong -- it is wrong to dislike all women due to abusive actions of some women and current system.  It is much worse for anyone to take out their anger on those who offer a helping hand. Unfortunately some members of Manosphere do verbally abuse women who are helping men. This is extremely unfair to the women who help men. This also puts men as a group into much worse isolation. Many women in Manosphere stoically took abuse from Misandrists and SJWs, but left when the very men they were defending started to insult them. Likewise, very few therapists would tolerate insulting patients.

An abused man who lashes out at those who are trying to help him hands the ultimate victory to his abusers. He demonstrates that they have succeeded in making him an unlikable and unhelpable.",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jf0m40/biting_a_helping_hand/,Qfu83

2020-10-21 18:20:00,Why men seem to rule the world - Are Apex fallacy and Frontman fallacy actually evolutionary mental shortcuts and cognitive biases?,"I'm trying to make sense of cognitive biases (or what Wikipedia calls cognitive biases https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias ). In case you didn't know:
&gt; A cognitive bias is a systematic pattern of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment.

It seems that most biases can be seen as mental shortcuts. As Kahneman wrote in *Thinking fast and slow*, the brain tries to conserve energy by not thinking more than what it has to. So, evolution has come up with all kinds of heuristics - let's call them mental shortcuts - that make judgements without long thought processes. Furthermore, it helps, if a lion is attacking, to run instead of thinking about running. So, shortcuts have actually at least two purposes: conserving energy and speeding up the decision processes.

Perhaps the most useful mental shortcut to know about is the Availability heuristic. It's also a great example. I once had a discussion with a male feminist who insisted that women have to wear really revealing clothes. I said that he just think so because the women who wear such clothes are unusual and exciting, so, he tends to remember them when he thinks about women's clothing. That's Availability heuristic: what's unusual, emotional, and recent is more available to our thought processes and, thus, to our judgements. (The guy went out, came back, and said that I was right, which has been one of the very rare occasions when I have been able to make somebody change his or her mind on social media.) 

So, mental shortcuts can lead us astray. Actually, the reason why they are talked about so much is probably the fact that they often lead to universal and recurrent and thus predictable judgement errors. 

But when certain mental shortcuts first came about they must have been useful; otherwise evolution would have removed them. It must have been useful to base your judgements, for example, on unusual, emotional, and recent things.

So, I don't think that biases always are ""deviations of norm or rationality"". Rather, they are often mental shortcuts that serve a purpose, or, at least, served a purpose for our ancestors, and 

* that purpose must have been rational from the perspective of evolution, and 
* the purpose of evolution is to produce sexually mature offspring, and 
* thus some of the biases served our and our children's survival. 

A mental shortcut had a reason, an evolutionary purpose. 

Now, ""Apex fallacy"" seems to refer to something that is logically wrong. And, indeed, it is logically wrong to *""[evaluate a group based on the performance of best group members, not a representative sample of the group members](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Apex_fallacy#Wikipedia)""*. 

But why do we do it? Is there an evolutionary purpose to take this particular mental shortcut? I don't think this has been studied in a laboratory or real life. Or if it has, there should, could be a Wikipedia article on it. Nevertheless, it seems to make very much sense to make a judgement about a group by the one or ones who are at the top, the ""apex"". Millions of years of evolution have taught us to understand who, within human groups, is the leader and to pay attention to what he does. And though we are not chimpanzees, it's still educational to study how their social life revolves around the alpha male.

Is the Apex fallacy, then, not so much a logical mistake, but one of the fundamental human biases, the Apex heuristic? I think it could be. I think we are hard-wired to judge social groups by observing the leader or leaders. And, as with so many mental shortcuts, something that made perfect sense millions of years ago, in modern societies leads astray.  In free-market democracies among the powerful there are no alpha males left to watch, just marionettes who try to look like alphas.

Furthermore, there was, in our ape times, a difference between how males and females saw the leader. For males the alpha male was somebody to be afraid of or compete with - or in rare case be devoted and allied to. But for females he is somebody to mate with. Could this be one reason many women think we live in the ""man's world"", why they are prone to the Frontman fallacy, *[‚Äùthe mistaken belief that people \(men, specifically\) who are in positions of authority in democratic systems use their power mainly to benefit the categories of people \(the category of ‚Äúmen‚Äù, in particular\) that they belong to themselves""](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Apex_fallacy#Frontman_Fallacy)*?

Men, at least in democratic societies, seldom see the men at the top as their friends and allies, not because of their sex, anyway. Their attitude is often deeply suspicious, they don't expect to get any special treatment because they are the same sex. And they are right in their thinking: through ages, male leaders have had no problem sending men to the battle fields and women to safety.  Similarly, it would be insane to claim that business leaders would or could make decisions whose purpose was to favor men (unless it serves some money-making plan). 

In other words, I don't think that the Frontman fallacy is something men indulge in. But what about women? 

If our female ancestors saw no reason to compete with the alpha male or to be particularly afraid of, how did it affect their attitude towards the leader and the whole hierarchy? Unfortunately, I have only very speculative thoughts about that. Could it be that, though women understand hierarchies on an ""ape level"" probably as well as men, they have always been in some sense outsiders, not directly taking part in the fierce fight over leadership? It's been something ""the males do"".  As outsiders they didn't have any reason to be particularly interested in what actually happens, the mechanics of the power struggle. Their interest has been to watch it only to know who is the winner - and the future father of the children of the lucky ones. 

This starts to sound so far-fetched or simplistic that I apparently have to think this further. 

But I still think that there could be a difference between men and women, insiders and outsiders when it comes to seeing the realm of power. And if so, there could be something called the Frontman bias, a predictable  error, ""deviation from rationality"", that is more common among women than men. 

Anyway, it would be interesting to test these hypotheses. Somebody, a psychologist or economist, should do it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jfa7tw/why_men_seem_to_rule_the_world_are_apex_fallacy/,accidental_me

I said ""I identify as a visible minority"", she asked me what race I belong to, my response ""Not a racial minority, but a visible minority because I am a male and males are both a visible minority in Canda in general and also in the CPS""

She moved on, probably marked ""NO"" even though I said ""Yes"".

At the end of the interview, she asked me if I had any questions, so I asked ""I am confused as to why you wanted to know why you asked if I identify as a woman when women are 55.3% of the public service, shouldn't you be trying to get more men, since we are quickly becoming the vast minority"". She said, ""No, women are still designated as a minority for the purposes of hiring"".

2020-10-22 03:17:55,Here is my radical manifesto.,"Few days ago I finally decided to watch The Red Pill. Afterwards, it just felt like for the first time in my life someone actually cared about me. It reminded me that I'm *not* misogynistic, evil, insane, stupid, a loser, or dangerous. I never realized just how far the rabbit hole went. I spent hundreds of hours over the last week studying endlessly... researching without pause. I have OCD. I just couldn't stop reading. 

Feminism is predicated on a lie. This all-consuming hegemony on social discourse is de facto censorship. Enforced by legal institutions, powerful organizations, and moderators online. Men are *not* the oppressors, and never have been. The implicit lexicon of feminism is inherently misandrist. Allusions to this *disease* of masculinity through ""toxic masculinity"" and ""patriarchy"" are cruel and unfounded. The associated incongruence of authority can be attributed to biology. This is exactly why feminism can no longer ""push"" for social change. There will never be an equal distribution of outcome, because the sexes are not identical. If you refuse to accept that there are innate biological differences between the genders, you create an endless cycle of victimization. 

An equal and opposite reaction. When you operate on the  principal that women *must* be disadvantaged, and men *must* be the oppressors, society grinds to a halt. Governments no longer represent the interests of their male population. Social issues that disenfranchise men become taboo, and even unconscionable. Academia starts to traumatize young boys by telling them how evil they *really* are. 

Those boys grow up eventually. Indeed, feminist influence is not relegated to half of the population. Even among the highest echelons of power, composed of predominately men, they paradoxically, but unwittingly, act against their inherent interests. 

We don't hate women. *Here is my radical manifesto.* I want the same legal protections as women. I want reproductive rights, autonomy over my own body, protection from domestic/sexual abuse, and an unbiased/independent judiciary. Of preeminent importance is that we *need* political representation.  We are the taxpayers, we the people, we deserve a voice too.

Articles like this, low key influence men to think it's their fault for any problems they might encounter ""in the wilderness"". She needs to ""find"" herself, you're not good enough. Basically it tells women to treat men like disposable s\*x toys ! No.7 ""You love the excitement of first kisses"" and No.8 ""You want to taste all the flavors of the casual s\*x scene"".

Looking back on past relationships there was definite moments of abuse, some of the things that have been said to me were so hurtful they just broke me, if i said anything like that to a woman it would've rightly been considered disgusting. I think about messaging them to let them know that what they said to me was disgusting, but i know that's salty, and it would be best to move on.

2020-10-22 20:01:43,Never forget that John Cleese (from Monty Python) divorce.,"Fawlty Towers star John Cleese claims a reported $23 million divorce settlement with this third wife will leave him poorer than her and bound to work well into his 70s.

The renowned comedy actor is giving his American former wife of 16 years, Alyce Faye Eichelberger, $15.8 million in cash and assets as well as $1.1 million a year for seven years under the terms of their divorce settlement, Britain's Daily Telegraph reported. 

The papers to finalise the settlement were lodged in a Californian court last week.

Cleese, 70, is reportedly writing a one-man show to be titled My Alyce Faye Divorce Tour.

He said of the outcome: ""I got off lightly. Think what I'd have had to pay Alyce if she had contributed anything to the relationship.""

But the actor has also reportedly complained it will leave him poorer than Eichelberger, a psychotherapist with two sons from a previous marriage.

""What I find so unfair is that if we both died today, her children would get much more than mine,‚Äù Cleese said.

""At least I will know in future if a I go out with a lady they will not be after me for my money.""

Cleese also said in a recent interview the settlement would force him to keep working.

""In my 70th year I will still be spending two months a year doing work that is of no interest to me and which is probably slightly spiritually depleting in order to feed the beast,"" he said.

Friends say Cleese is furious about the arrangement, which gives Eichelberger an apartment in New York, a $4 million house in London and half a beach house they're selling in California.

""John has worked all his life and will now have to continue working because he has seen a huge chunk of what he has worked for going to his former wife who he rescued from a council flat,‚Äù friend and former film director Michael Winner said.

""It is an extraordinary world which means John is left with much less than his former wife even though he is the star who did all the work.

""The settlement defies human belief. John is extremely cross about it and I don't blame him.

""The settlement comes after two years of harrowing legal argument.‚Äù

Cleese has two adult daughters with his first two wives, Connie Booth and Barbara Trentham.

He met Eichelberger in 1990, when she was reportedly living in a council flat in London with her two sons.

2020-10-22 21:12:40,"Why is only women‚Äôs body image being championed by the media? Men are just as vulnerable, if not more, to similar judgements in society.","This may or may not have been pointed out before, but this has been on my mind for a while, and I wanted to do my bit to raise awareness among my fellow MRAs. 

More and more I‚Äôve been seeing adverts by clothing retailers who make a point of directly highlighting and parading social injustices to women-particularly around body image and self-confidence. 

The problem here is that these are becoming so frequent and clearly one-sided, that we‚Äôre fed the rhetoric that us men are immune from being body shamed and judged all the same-in society. 

I‚Äôve seen first hand men being shamed for their weight by their wives/girlfriends/colleagues who are quite clearly obese themselves. But what do the men do? The usual...put up, shut up, laugh it off or grin and bear it. Why don‚Äôt we say anything to defend ourselves? The answer is that women have become so empowered by the media that it‚Äôs driven many of them to psychotic levels of projection and delusion. What defence do we have? 

There have indeed been adverts for bigger men, but not once did these highlight that being larger (than average) was acceptable or even desirable! Instead, the adverts were purely commercial.

I must add, that it‚Äôs not only larger men who suffer from body image issues and discrimination. Men who are shorter or ‚Äòskinnier‚Äô receive just as much abuse from women. This isn‚Äôt to mention the fact that they are grossly under represented in fashion and the media. 

I‚Äôve always said that this is one of the key stressors to our confidence and mental health, but again, society has tended to our disregard in favour of the more ‚Äòworthy‚Äô and ‚Äòvulnerable‚Äô women. 

For the hell of it, just imagine the furore and humour that would arise if these adverts were made for men. There would almost certainly be mass protests from the usual feminists claiming that women were being neglected and victimised by this. 

Ultimately, it‚Äôs the fear of reprisal that keeps us silenced. Why are we scared? Because we have been, and we are continually being brainwashed by the media that we aren‚Äôt worthy fighting for. 

Things have got to change; we simply cannot let society remain ignorant to this.",1.0,1.0,1.0,22.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jfzcyg/why_is_only_womens_body_image_being_championed_by/,LameFossil

Alright guys. I work for a library department in Arizona. We have this one custodian that absolutely refuses to announce herself when she enters the men‚Äôs restroom. However, when we have a male custodian, he is absolutely required to announce himself when entering the women‚Äôs restroom, and god forbid that male custodian forgets to or he would probably find himself unemployed quickly. 

Here‚Äôs what happened, and this isn‚Äôt the first or second time. I‚Äôm in the restroom, doing my business, when our female custodian enters the restroom, completely unannounced, making me feel very uncomfortable, especially while I‚Äôm in the process of urinating. She usually walks in, stares at me for a few seconds and then proceeds to grab the trash can and leave. Had she been a male and I a female in the women‚Äôs restroom, the situation would be very very different. And filing complaints against her gets me absolutely no where. 

Now I understand, there are places where unisex restrooms exist, but not here in Arizona. And in fact, there is a policy that says that men need to announce themselves when entering the women‚Äôs restroom, but I can‚Äôt find one policy that goes for women entering the male restroom.

2020-10-23 01:35:36,White Knights at /r/ProgrammingHumor downvoted me to HELL for saying that being excited to talk to a female programmer online does not a harasser make.,"[Source](https://np.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/jg1mgp/the_harassment_never_ends/g9nlrqw/?context=3)

So a woman posted a post on /r/ProgrammingHumor decrying sexual harassment women in tech are experiencing.

As proof, she screenshotted parts of her conversation with one 'lonelybrokenguy'.

[Screenshot 1](https://i.imgur.com/ZGT8KGA.png)
[Screenshot 2](https://i.imgur.com/HuvBue6.png)

In that screenshot, the guy commits the egregious crime of saying ""I wish you weren't in a relationship"". In the second screenshot, it appears that the woman told this guy that she has a male boyfriend but that she's a lesbian. (Not trying to make sense of that one...)

So the guy asks something along the lines of 'does your boyfriend know about you sleeping with women?'. And she says 'Yes. And he is supportive.' To which the guy replies with 'So how many women did you sleep with?' And she says 'It's nobody's business'. Once she says this he immediately apologizes and says he didn't mean to hurt her. 

Let's recap, shall we:

A girl is asked whether or not she's in a relationship. She says she is a lesbian but has a boyfriend. Which steers the conversation to a semi sexual area. And the girl doesn't show that she is bothered by the guy's questions about how this arrangement actually works. When it actually comes to a point where she isn't comfortable with the questions. She says as much and the guy immediately apologizes.

In her mind (And it seems that to the mind of the white knights there as well.) this is a glaring example of sexual harassment.

Am I losing my mind?

2020-10-23 08:42:05,A topic came up with the lads in work.......,"A topic came up in conversation with lads in work (I work on a production line making cars so being a predominantly working class male environment a good few men‚Äôs rights topics pop up from time to time.

Anyway, I read an article and asked a few lads ‚Äúwho do you think was in the wrong here?‚Äù I was surprised by a few of the opinions. I thought it was very clear cut in my mind, so I guess I‚Äôd like to hear your points of views on the same question. After all it‚Äôs always good to taken on different opinions or at least consider them.

So a guy if 18 or 19 I can‚Äôt remember which but he definitely wasn‚Äôt over 19 (as remember him not being in his 20‚Äôs) was in a club/bar with friends on a Saturday night out and was enjoying a good few drinks here in the UK, being young and well....British he had a skin full and was pretty drunk.

He meets this girl in there, she was cracking on to him, they hit it off and end up going back to his place (a university student accommodation if I remember correctly). They have sex, all is well. She goes off home in the morning, he gets up and goes about his day a little hungover but chuffed he ‚Äúpulled‚Äù and met a girl, they had a great time etc. 

This young girl was 15, her dad gave her a grilling when she arrived home after staying out all night. In the end she fesses you what she got up to, telling him she‚Äôd been to a club/bar with friends, met a guy and stayed at his.

Long story short, dad goes ballistic. Demands her to tell him who is and where he lives etc. Finds out, police involved. He‚Äôs then charged and found guilty of statutory rape, put on a sex offenders register and put into the catagory/reputation of being a ‚Äúnonce/Paedo‚Äù

His life is ruined forever (for being young drunk and a irresponsibly naive). May of even gone to prison, I don‚Äôt know for certain as I don‚Äôt think court had ended at the time the article was written and I didn‚Äôt follow it up. 

Girl admitted that she‚Äôd had sexual relations prior to that night. 

Opinions on who‚Äôs in the wrong here? The guy, the girl, the club, the law or maybe the dad for not speaking to him and finding out exactly what had happened?",1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jgchp3/a_topic_came_up_with_the_lads_in_work/,Jenko_85

2020-10-23 14:33:58,Men being raped in the media,"I always found it odd that the media never said the word ""rape"" when it come to men being sexually assaulted, in a thread about consent and being drunk a user posted the below information. This kind of changes it, it's not the media necessarily making it seem like a less we thing, it's the laws of the state making so they can't call it rape, otherwise they'd be liable. 

This needs to change.


&gt;First, the hard truth is that most state's rape laws require penetration. A male can be raped if he's penetrated. A male cannot be raped by a female that is penetrated by him. Emphasis on **most states**.

&gt;Second, legal consent cannot typically be given by someone that is inebriated. So if a male and female are very intoxicated and have sex, while neither can legally give consent, the female is penetrated and could therefore be considered rape.",1.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jghslv/men_being_raped_in_the_media/,Nerfixion

2020-10-23 16:07:29,"The idea that we can simply be ""free from gender norms"" is probably not accurate. Science shows humans develop and enforce norms naturally, subconsciously and illogically from an an early age.","tl;dr is at the bottom

Drawing on some research on the subject, it looks like people naturally observe and [imitate](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/why_imitation_is_at_the_heart_of_being_human) each other and it is isn't an entirely conscious/logical process. This is obvious in the [Asch line experiments](https://www.thoughtco.com/asch-conformity-experiment-3026748) and [Zimbardo prison experiment](https://www.simplypsychology.org/zimbardo.html). People made statements and took actions that they knew to be wrong because they were following group influence.

However,  the process runs quite a bit deeper than logical consideration and  doesn't just affect adults. As the first link shows, children (even  pre-schooling age kids) will actively develop and enforce norms, even  illogical ones. Another [study](https://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Elsevier/G%C3%B6ckeritz_Young_CogDev_2014_2029011.pdf) shows they do this with games and [another one](https://www.benkenward.com/articles/Kenward_in_press_Overimitating_preschoolers.pdf) demonstrates they will, unbidden, complain when anyone breaks a norm.

Very  simply put, I think the science shows that we cannot live free of  social norms. As a result, the idea that ""you can be whoever you want""  is almost certainly false and will not stand the test of time.

The next question is do men and women have to have different norms? Looking at *Manhood in the Making*  (David Gilmore) which is a collection and summary of ethnographies on  masculinity, in rare cultures it is possible for men and women to be  seen as substantially similar, but even here there is definite  differentiation.

It is worth noting that for men and women to have similar personalities, the examples in *Manhood in the Making* all force men to be soft, effeminate and relatively passive (IMO). My  impression from other readings is this is not the case in egalitarian  societies. In general the closer a society gets to egalitarian, the  stronger men become.

**tl;dr / conclusion**  \- It appears pretty clear the promise of ""you can be whoever you want""  is a false promise--humans simply don't work that way. From a very young  age we spontaneously create and enforce norms. The idea that we  couldn't or wouldn't is simply wrong. We can probably force men to be  soft and similar personalities between men and women, but unless you  believe personality must be identical, I do not believe it is necessary for egalitarianism.",1.0,1.0,1.0,40.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jgiydp/the_idea_that_we_can_simply_be_free_from_gender/,smeltaway

2020-10-23 20:10:03,I had a panic attack today and got pretty much ignored because another girl hurt her wrist (long),"So I do army cadets at my school, and today I was feeling shit. I don‚Äôt know why, I don‚Äôt know for what reasons, but I was down today. For the past 2 and a half months, or really since my mate killed himself, I‚Äôve been having panic attacks worse than I did for the 2 years prior. They‚Äôve been worse and more frequent and today I got the worst one I‚Äôve ever had. I was sitting in English and stopped breathing. I knew what was happening and asked the teacher to get a drink and he let me go walk around for a bit to calm down. That‚Äôs a normal one. After school I had cadets and we had the first parade of our cadet year which is famous for being the recruits‚Äô first parade and it‚Äôs in the hot Australian summer. Every year 30+ kids faint. This year was more chill. Only a few faintings, but half way through the parade, I stopped breathing again. I felt as if someone was crushing my chest in a vice. I couldn‚Äôt feel my face. Couldn‚Äôt feel my hands. Couldn‚Äôt talk. Couldn‚Äôt breathe. I stayed standing for 10 minutes not wanting to interrupt the parade until a kid a few sections down fainted backwards like a dead plank. After 5 more minutes I finally decided this was serious and I took a knee which is what we are told to do if we need medic attention. I was taken over to the medic area and finally managed to squeeze out that I was having a panic attack. They gave me a cup of water and then left me there alone to tend to others but soon it became the case that it was just me and a girl who had tripped and sprained her wrist. She was crying and carrying on over her wrist while I was silently trying to focus on not dying a few feet away from her. The entire platoon, and I mean entire platoon of medics (20-30 people) surrounded this one girl to make sure she was comforted and contented while only one kid stayed with me. He was super sweet and stayed next to me telling me how he went through the same things and knew how tough they were. I got so light headed from the attack I passed out in my chair and when I came to, people were still crowding around this girl, and still I had only my one new friend from medics. 

I guess I could be misreading the situation, but it just seems like people didn‚Äôt care about me because they‚Äôd rather help the girl. I also admit that with the emotions I‚Äôm experiencing right now, that could contribute to my misreading but what do you all think?",1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jglvwr/i_had_a_panic_attack_today_and_got_pretty_much/,Tasty69Toes

2020-10-24 05:49:26,Don't allow language to be hijacked,"I've been frustrated with how feminist extremists seem to love to take language and twist it to make men look as bad as possible.  For example, the term ""friendzone"" has been used for a long time to express disappointment when a man had been hoping to get together with a woman romantically, but she says ""let's be friends.""  It's a sucky situation, and he's doing nothing wrong by feeling disappointed.  All our lives we've been pressured to hide our emotions, so we should embrace it if a man feels disappointed and expresses that feeling.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But along come the haters to twist ""friendzone"" into meaning he somehow felt ""entitled to sex.""  I don't know any man who thinks a woman owes him sex.  It's perfectly normal for a man to feel attraction toward women and want to find a girlfriend.  Yet, lately there's been a lot of hostility toward men who attempt to do that.  If a man goes out trying to meet women hoping he'll find someone special, there's nothing wrong with that.  Yet, thanks to extremist feminists, that innocuous term ""friendzone"" gets made sinister.  Supposedly he thinks she owes him sex and so he's practically a rapist.  That's total BS.  

When I was a kid, about 8 years old, I went over to a friend's house.  About 4 other boys were there.  We decided it would be fun to wade through the creek there in our blue jeans and T shirts.  Of course, that got our clothes and shoes totally wet.  When we got back, my friend's mom said, ""boys will be boys.""  That's another innocuous expression used to mean boys do boy kind of things like playing in the mud.  Boys do things that girls typically don't like such as that, wading through the creek like my friends and I did, riding bikes over ramps, and playing with toy trucks.  Again, there's nothing wrong with any of this, but leave it to the feminist bigots to come along and hijack an expression.  They've claimed that expression is all about rapists making excuses for their crimes.  Don't let them.  Almost all men despise rapists.  In fact, it's rapists who get most assaulted in prison.  Men despise them.  We have no absurd conspiracy to make excuses for rapists.  This notion of ""rape culture"" is nonsense.  Rape has been both illegal and despised for centuries.  Leave it to feminist extremists to try to hijack ""boys will be boys"" to try to prove how evil men supposedly are.  They're wrong.  And they're being disgusting and hateful people to try to twist language in ways that make men look as bad as possible.  

These are just two examples.  There are many more, but if I kept writing, this would end up at dissertation-length.  There are also words that feminists make up like ""mansplain"" that's designed specifically to stereotype men and shame us, hoping to shut down dialogue as if our ideas were automatically wrong because of our gender.  That's hostility.  That's hate.  I may write in more detail about that some other time.  

In short, I want to encourage men to fight back and take back language.  Language is supposed to exist as a tool for communication.

Oh and if a man accidentally lashes out at his wife, he will get arrested and possibly fired from his job if the woman reports him to the police.

[https://youtu.be/cUXtvsKyOTg](https://youtu.be/cUXtvsKyOTg)

I never knew I wanted to be a blue pilled man until I saw these 15 reasons on BuzzFeed.

1.I can't get out of bed now without thinking that all the USA presidents where men.

2. I want to wear high heels to be able to run from a T-Rex, just in case...and feel empowered !

3. Now I believe anecdotal evidence...my feelings come first.

4. I now realize that Dress Codes are sexist, I should be able to dress like a clown in business meetings and fight patriarchy !

5. I believe the pay gap is real. Women in offices should earn as much as a Iron Workers because the AC is sexist.

6. Because Barbie exists, many women have eating disorders...this needs to stop.

7. Women should be payed for taking care of the house and their own children, because I feel like it.

8. I'm tired of men choosing what's right for women. Women should get the right to vote...

9. I don't want women to be afraid of going out at night in dimly lit alley ways and feel scared.

10. Girls feel less smart than boys by age 6, so I am going to link to Chinese-American physicist Chien-Shiung Wu for some reason...

11. USA Congress is...uhm...sexist...OK ? Here's a picture of Hillary Clinton doing math.

12. Somewhere in America, a woman is raped every 2 minutes. Just trust me...anecdotal evidence is the best. We don't care if it's true or not. We don't follow up on that.

13. I'm going to give you data from 2002 when NO BOYS or MEN where abused. Mkay...shhh, don't look at the recent data. [https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/story/human-trafficking-and-gender-differences-similarities-and-trends](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/story/human-trafficking-and-gender-differences-similarities-and-trends)

14. Something something about women of color, but did I talk about abortions yet ? (BuzzFeed, not me)

15. You don't care, you can't understand !

2020-10-25 18:04:21,Police ignores my fianc√©'s harassment claims,"(This is long) Boy do I have a story for you. Apologies for the formatting and longevity! 

A little background info: I'm a third world citizen, coming from a country that has very defined gender roles and a natural respect for men as they are the ones forced into the military and do most of the labor. I traveled to Europe for my college degree and met my fianc√© (both mid twenties). At first, of course Europe came a bit of a shock to me, I realized that culturally men are at a social disadvantage that no one tells them about. Day after day went by as I stood in awe of the new feminist movement, observing the deeply entitled behavior of women marching for equality - who seem to have a picky choosy attitude as to which aspect they would like to apply this equality to. Never would it have occurred to me that this attitude infilitrated their legal system.

Fast forward to meeting this wonderful man. After about 7 months of being official, my then boyfriend, let's call him Ben, was featured on an Instagram page, so I created an account (didn't have one and really dislike the platform) to see the posts he's featured in and like them. This is where hell ensues.

One day after liking two pictures he's featured in I get a message from a woman. ""Hi I was wondering how you know Ben?"". The woman proceeded to explain that she had noticed me as a new follower of his and that I had liked his tagged pictures. She insisted on an explanation. 
Now Ben and I have 0 posts and are generally very private about our personal lives on the internet, so our relationship isn't ""out there"". I ask him and he says that this woman is his ex - let's call her Keyla.

Why does he have his ex on his social media? Well, because she's bat-sh*t crazy. Keyla threatened self-harm if he blocked her from anything, and on a few occasions even showed up in front of his *parents* house when he blocked her. So he just stopped blocking her, and she continued to call every day, even from different caller IDs. I remember picking up the phone once and I just heard heavy breathing when she realized it was a female voice that answered her. 

For the next few days I did as he said, I ignored her and blocked her, so did he. She went absolutely insane. 
She contacted and (where applicable) video called me on every thinkable platform (LinkedIn as well), and spammed me with waves of messages at odd times that were all either incredibly offensive or desperate seeking sympathy. 

Things got worse with her harassment towards him as now she felt ""threatened"" by my existence. She called over 30 times a day. Sent emails that insinuated suicide if he doesn't meet her or claimed to drive to his parents (during Covid) and ""do something he wouldn't like"". Ben now feared that she could harm his parents or would contact his employers and he couldn't estimate the limits of how far this woman was willing to go.
At this point we went to the police. This is where the doors of hell shut and swallowed us whole.

As Ben explained the situation, the police officer seemed extremely uninterested and kept interrupting him with ""did you talk it out?"" - what a brilliant suggestion that Ben didn't come up with in the last 2 years!! 
After telling him about the suicide-threats he got aggressive and said ""hey hey those are some grave allegations"" and advised us to try to talk to her ""as a team"". At this point I just wanted to cry, knowing exactly that if I had made half of these claims in this precinct about a man who is tormenting me this way that I would get immediate help. 

The police officer kept advising us against filing a report as this could ""ruin her life"" and made judgmental remarks about how we should be more empathetic towards a woman who is just emotional. He lied about not finding her name in the system just to buy more time to tell us that this isn't worth it. After 2 hours, he finally let us file the report. With countless scoffs and interruptions while we were handing in evidence to support the case. Even saying that Ben was a lucky guy having ""2 women fight over him"".

He wanted a restraining order. Or a confirmation that a report was filed. Anything to show her so she would just stop. We got neither. The police officer said he had to get this approved before giving us a confirmation, and reiterated that we are horrible for wanting to ruin this girl's career instead of just ""moving somewhere else and changing numbers"".

Ben is living with me, so there is (for now as long as she doesn't find out my address) no way for her to show up at his house and hurt him. But the harassment hasn't stopped. 5 months passed with no change in her behavior and we had nothing (usually you and the person you filed against get a letter). We received a call from the police and we were so excited - but they were just asking whether we wanted to go through with the report or not - after 5 months!
We still haven't heard back from them (8 months now), nor have we received a letter, nor has this woman experienced any consequences for her behavior. 

The average time it takes for a woman to file a harassment report in this country (mid Europe) is 2 weeks. She usually gets a restraining order in that time. The police of her address's district also passes by her house at night periodically. I'm ashamed of how this country is so √†-la-cart supportive of equality. Bare in mind we have a &gt;25% female quota, we are one of the leading countries of equality. What a load of bull.

They married and he moved in with her, my 8 year old son, and his two older brothers.  From the moment he moved in he began physically disciplining everyone in the house (including the dog) except for my ex.  My son now is peeing in the bed, despises ME, has low self esteem and I'm being blamed.  We never had any issues of this kind until he came into the picture.  My son revealed to me that he beats him with the spatula.

2020-10-26 05:20:19,Single mothers and dating expectations," I apologize if this isn't appropriate subject matter for this sub but I can't seems to post this question in any more popular relationship subs. 

So my sister is a single mother (age 26, dropped out of university). I told her that in my opinion she will have a harder time finding men because of this and she will probably have to compromise on the traits of any guy she finds to date. She and my mom reject this idea for some reason. It seems common sense to me that men don't want to dat single mothers.  

She has a guy who's interested in her and they started dating or whatever but now I overheard that she's losing interest in him. She said he can be annoying(in an innocent way, it might be a personality quirk she's talking about).

The gentleman in question isn't the tallest or most attractive dude, but he seems like a really good caring guy with a good future.

Anyways the main question is this - is she cut off from a certain percentage of the male population because of her single motherhood? Are there a ton of good guys who will not date single mothers? Is she at risk of valuing herself too high and passing guys by who she thinks she can do better?

I fear she's going to keep making the same mistakes. She's going to date an attractive guy but he only considers her a pump and dump and then she rinses and repeats.

&amp;#x200B;

2020-10-26 06:46:34,contemporary feminism is not true equality anymore,"feminism isnt the way it used to be anymore. women can much less prison time for sexual assault and not to mention how they cant be charged with rape. 1/10 men are raped by women which yes is a lot less than women‚Äôs rape cases but at least men can actually be charged. in usa, women are legally unable to be charged with rape in majority states with few exceptions e.g. california where male rape cases are still most commonly ignored. also in the uk, strictly men can be charged with rape. male prison rape is so common yet unaddressed and the general intrinsic value of men in society is perceived as half a women‚Äôs: why do toy think it is that only men get drafted to war and women are more likely to win in court despite evidence ? feminism isnt the usual women = men anymore. its about the ability to state women‚Äôs issue while ignoring men‚Äôs. until men = women is what contemporary feminism truly stands for, i am not a feminist. out of three sexual assault victims, one is male. and yes forcing someone to put their penis in your vagina isnt ‚Äúrape‚Äù ITS RAPE. it coercion and force. women are statistically weaker than men biologically so they use emotional manipulation because society treats men getting sex as a reward; that every men likes it. well, youre wrong. we are individuals. we are humans. and we want feminism to start addressing men‚Äôs rights as much as anything else because feminism isnt about women, its about men and women. thats the entire principle of feminism: men = women. from uneven suicide rates to us being forced to pay child support without the say in if i want a child or not simple because its not in my body. yes it is women‚Äôs choice but with that logic it is also men‚Äôs choice to not have to take care of the children or pay for them since it was in the women‚Äôs body and since women have the choice to remove the baby and get rid of financial and emotional burden why shouldnt men ? also disproportionate suicide rates for men and women, disproportionate murder victims for men and women. why isnt that spoken as much as the disproportionate rape victims between men and women ? the reason is this: men are judged by his success, women are judged by her identity. therefore, until that is addressed, i am not a feminist. 

we, as men, just want equal representation by feminists. people fail to realize that only a minority of men are truly evil, the rest wants equality and representation.

(by the way this isnt about men having it worse then women or anything. its just about how we are not represented equally by feminists.)

I even remember once when I was talking to my Mom she had a female friend who was fighting for custody.

Since a woman can have an abortion with or without the would be fathers consent, a man should be able to chose if he wants to pay or not for a kid that is not his. Equality, BUT no. 

 Later the mother of the child had sued her ex for alimony, and the court had ruled that he is obliged to pay alimony totalling ‚Ç¨308 ($360 dollars) per month until the child comes of age in 2032 as well as for the legal costs of the cheating wife who had taken him to court.

2020-10-27 05:45:41,How I helped my friend leave an abusive relationship.,"College story time.

I am friends with great guy named Nate. He meets a girl. Let's call her Andrea. His first girlfriend, he goes a bit crazy for her, especially after they start having sex. This is his first year in college mind you.

At first it seems amazing for him and I'm happy for him. He envisions her as the perfect woman and even tells me he plans to marry her one day (big red flag from my point of view).

Then she starts demanding things over and over again. His time and money for gifts and moves and so many other things. She texts him non stop when he's away, trying to control every part of his life. He's desperate to please her. She can never be pleased no matter how much he does for her. Eventually she turns into a total bitch.

His grades and mental health go down the toilet. Andrea starts gaslighting him and undermining his self confidence. He loses a LOT of friends except for me and another good dude named John. Me and John had been friends with Nate since college started but we didn't see how bad it got. I really hate myself for that since the relationship last over a year.

Eventually he has enough of this witch. He suck of her demands and is actually scared of her. He's on the verge of dropping out because of how much of his attention she's gotten from him. He begs us to help him and we agree. We were stunned by how bad he had gotten and are both ashamed we didn't step in sooner. We go alongside him to confront her and stand by as he calmly lays out the many reasons she sucks and breaks up with her. He deletes every picture he has of her and threatens a restraining order. She's just standing there trying to find sympathy as her control breaks and he leaves her. I remember vividly staring at her with hate in my eyes and she quickly realized I would not help her. It was beautiful.

Nate had a rough time getting over her (understandable it happens to everyone). He got his friends back though and is doing so much better. He didn't flunk out of school though he did take a few hits. He's still afraid of starting a new relationship but I think he'll work out some day with a better woman. He didn't mourn her for long though.

Turns out she was f\*cking a bunch of other guys and her parents were NOT happy when they found out (her culture is very strict). Last I heard she is still grounded and under threat of being cutoff with limited career options. Serves her right.

What stunned me most though was the resources Nate got from the school we were staying at. After breaking up he went to our Residential Advisor and got a bunch of resources for mental health. He even got in contact with security on campus that made sure he could get a restraining order (he never had to use it though. Bitch stayed away from him). Still I think the thing that helped him most was the fact his friends stood by him in his time of need and we have remained friends ever since. 

Anyone out there who needs help, please remember there are options and people who will help you if asked. I know it's hard with all these wild times in the world but trust me. Things can be better.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jio2t8/how_i_helped_my_friend_leave_an_abusive/,Rubricae98

The issue is, I don‚Äôt know how to help him. I was his boss, and my bosses wouldn‚Äôt take it seriously when they knew it was going on, just limit the time they could be around each other during working hours. Think same company, but couldn‚Äôt be in the same building. But he‚Äôs got some serious confidence issues after that whole ordeal.

Things she did to him:
-Manipulate/lie
-Stalk/Harass
-Call his friends/Block his friends
-Gaslight
-Invade every kind of privacy he had.

Every form of emotional abuse, she did. But because he‚Äôs a guy he‚Äôs afraid of repercussions/stigma of getting help. But maybe because I‚Äôm not a guy I can‚Äôt see it from that perspective? He is really mean to himself, does reckless things out of depression, and seems to settle with women who treat him awfully and I‚Äôm not sure how to help him, because no one else will.

I don‚Äôt know if this falls under men‚Äôs rights, but I put it here because I know my supervisors would never let this happen to a woman. I really want to help him, but I have no idea how.

2020-10-28 01:20:58,"Circumcision is most popular in societies and communities that are easily offended by sex and nudity, and that's a fact!","It seems like America, Islam societies and communities and even Judaism societies and communities are easily offended by sex and nudity and consider them a taboo thing.

The reason why routine circumcision started happening in America was so it would stop boys from masturbating. Back then, It was believe that masturbation caused problems. But also, back then and still even in today's world, sex is considered a controversial thing.

In those societies and communities, it seems people usually tend to get offended more by things that have to do with sex rather than violence itself. Extremely violent/graphic/gore stuff are more likely to be shown on American television than nudity or everything that is deemed sexual is.

An exact image of a penis entering a vagina is never shown in R rated movies, but a lot of extremely violent/graphic/gore stuff are. Why can of logic is that? Also, as for nudity, nudity doesn't equal sex. Sex and nudity are two different things. So for societies and communities to be that sensitive when it comes to stuff like nudity is so ridiculous. Clothes are a man-made thing! 

It's pretty sad that the concept of sex has to be considered so controversial to the point that people are more upset by it than violence.

While sex can be a bad thing (rape as an example), it can also be a beautiful thing when two consenting adults have sex together since it usually makes their bond stronger.

Why does sex have to be considered such a controversial thing in most religions? Sex is the reason why life exists in the first place. 

Also, I like the fact that homosexuality is considered a sin in a lot of religions because it goes against nature, but many of these religions who condemn homosexuality are also ok with circumcision and even support it despite the fact that it goes against nature.",1.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jj5fjy/circumcision_is_most_popular_in_societies_and/,AncientBodybuilder

I couldn't find anything online that says that frozen sperm wouldn't store viably for more than a lifetime. Rather than spending all this money on researching male bc methods that are complicated and untested, why areny vasectomies and freezing made more widely available.

2020-10-28 06:15:18,"Feminism Magazine's Feminism 101 defines toxic masculinity as: ""physically strong, unsentimental, and assertive"". Here's the science to prove all of those are good for you. (Seriously, even unsentimental is a net positive).","First the feminist [source](https://femmagazine.com/feminim-101-what-is-toxic-masculinity/).

**Physically Strong** \- A massive [study](https://www.bmj.com/content/337/bmj.a439) shows being muscular decreases your chance of getting cancer and dying, even after adjusting for your fitness level. The study included more than 8,700 men of all ages. It was also associated with lower levels of depression among all adults, in another large [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6139143/). 

**Unsentimental** \- According to [Dictionary.com](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/unsentimental) this means: ""not tending to indulge the emotions excessively."" In other words, not reacting with dramatic emotion to events in life. Another name for unsentimental then is emotionally stable. Emotional stability is associated with living longer ([study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2505356/)). Its opposite would then be neuroticism. According to [one study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2792076/): ""Neuroticism is a robust correlate and predictor of many different mental and physical disorders,"" which is probably why being emotionally stable helps you live longer.

**Assertive** \- According to the [Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/stress-management/in-depth/assertive/art-20044644): ""Assertiveness can help you control stress and anger and improve coping skills."" According to [Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/assertiveness), it helps anxiety, depression, self-esteem and confidence.

But there are FtM who think they are treated better as a man by society, and MtF who think they are treated better as a woman (note: not considering dysphoria). Are these cases the rules or the outliers? Does the fact FtM still think men have it better even after transition implies our complaints are moot? A FtM replied me yesterday that the reason I think women have it better is ""proof that the male privilege exists"" because I ""can afford to live in your fantasies"".

* **Sex**

* In February 2019, the male-only military draft registry was ruled to be unconstitutional by a federal district judge in National Coalition for Men v. Selective Service System.^[53] Following the ruling, Selective Service System attorney Jacob Daniels told reporters: ""Things continue here at Selective Service as they have in the past, which is men between the ages of 18 and 25 are required to register with Selective Service. And at this time, until we receive guidance from either the court or from Congress, women are not required to register for Selective Service.""^[54] **On August 13, 2020, the federal district judge's opinion was unanimously overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. The Court held that male-only military draft registration is constitutional on the basis that ""only the Supreme Court may revise its precedent.""^[55]**

A little more detail...

* **Appeal**

* The ruling was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.^[11] The Eagle Forum filed an amicus curiae brief supporting continued registration of men for the draft, opposing requiring women to register, and asking the Court of Appeals to overturn the District Court decision. A coalition including the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Texas, American Civil Liberties Union, 9to5 National Association of Working Women, A Better Balance, Gender Justice, KWH Law Center for Social Justice and Change, National Organization for Women Foundation, National Women‚Äôs Law Center, Women‚Äôs Law Center of Maryland, and Women‚Äôs Law Project filed an amicus curiae brief arguing that the Court of Appeals should uphold the District Court finding that the current Military Selective Service Act is unconstitutional.^[12] Oral arguments on the appeal were held March 3, 2020, before a 3-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals at Tulane Law School in New Orleans.^[13] A decision by the panel was issued on August 13, 2020, reversing the District Court judgment on the grounds that it amounted to overturning the Supreme Court's precedent, which only the Supreme Court has the authority to do.^[14] Harry Crouch, President of the National Coalition for Men, announced that NCFM was ""exploring its options, including filing a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the United States Supreme Court.""^[15]",1.0,1.0,1.0,2.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jjmguz/national_coalition_for_men_v_selective_service/,tenchineuro

2020-10-28 21:23:05,Today I Went to Jail -- And Nobody Gives a Shit,"Note, this was written yesterday but I wasn't sure if I wanted to post this.

A few years ago I filed for divorce from my psychopathic/histrionic and abusive wife of 12 years. She flipped the narrative and accused me of all the things I was running away from. Guess what? Everyone believed her. No evidence, no arrests, no rehabs, no psychiatric treatment. And the female ""referee"" took everything as fact. Last year we had a custody trial. The female judge did the same, and treated all the accusations as facts. Threw away my evidence, text messages, emails, witnesses, and the expert witness was prevented from testifying properly.

This set in motion the support case. As punishment for taking things to trial, the nearly all female domestics office, no doubt none of which have an MBA or the slightest understanding of business accounting, ruled that my business losses don't count, but in fact are somehow nontaxable *personal* distributions. They double counted income, ignored that it was paid out at a later time, and completely ignored the law, citing judicial discretion. 

It was then when I learned about judicial immunity, and that they can get away with doing whatever they want. The female judge rubber stamped the order. Only issuing an opinion *after* I appealed. And only then claiming that my testimony was ""self serving and dishonest"" despite the fact that it was done via depositions. She had never seen or heard me speak. My depositions were my lease agreement and receipts. Female judge, female staff--except the security guards with guns. They want $5,000/month, more than 100% of my after tax income.

My ex, not satisfied with living in what is now a half a million dollar home while I share a rental, filed for contempt. 5 times. The court refused to do anything due to covid, but sure enough I was sent to the front of the line, as her psychopathic and attorney requested. The same attorney who lied during multiple hearings in front of the judge.

Today I went to the contempt hearing. Despite ten years of tax returns showing I never made that kind of money, despite my accounts being empty, despite my loan balances being high, despite my physician stressing to not work so much overtime--I was sentenced to 30 days in jail. My ex gleefully testifying, lying under oath, to the female case officer, to the female judge. The male bailiff put the handcuffs on me, escorted me to the holding cell.

In the next several hours while I waited for my female SO to ""purge"" me out with our next month's rent, another man entered the cell. Sentenced to 30 days, again. Waiting for his female wife to purge him out. His kids in their 30's, arrears from 10 years ago while he was incarcerated and they refused to stop the support. Ex wife is on a crack binge with her boyfriend, ran out of money and wanted him shaken down.

An hour later another man entered the cell, black man in his 50's, high blood pressure and diabetes, waiting for his SSI to kick in. Was laid off from service job due to COVID. 30 days. Same purge...but no family to get him out. His kids are 30, 27, 25, 20 is the youngest. He's still there, in the solitary cell waiting for the 4 day period to elapse for them to clear his TB test.

An hour later another man entered the cell, a young guy I'd probably employ at some point. He has an 8 year old and a two year old. His ex filed when he missed one payment after being laid off. He has a 2 week old with his fiancee.  A young mother with a two week old that now doesn't have a partner to fall back on.

I sat on the concrete bench (there was no chairs or padding) for hours, staring at my brown stained striped jumpsuit and foam orange crocks made by Bob Barker's company. The suit was not your regular cotton, but has the texture of a burlap bag. On your bare skin. In talking to the others in the holding cell who have done this a few times before, it is apparently a county that LOVES to jail fathers. While I don't know the exact numbers (though I plan to do a FOIA request to find out) a good percentage of the population is us so called ""deadbeats."" 

Most of the judges are female. The entire Domestic section is run and staffed by nearly all female workers. The law? Doesn't matter when you have no accountability as a judge. You can do whatever you want.

You'd think this kind of thing would possibly get some attention right? A real life debtors prison staffed by rogue judges and case workers?

NOBODY CARES. I've met with state reps, I've spoken out at town halls with members of congress, and invariably you get the same thing. A quick meeting, some time with a staffer, and then a nice letter about how they don't get involved in ""personal"" matters. To get to the governor is no small feat. All this while a relatively light shared parenting bill can't get the light of day because -- wait -- you can guess it -- the JUDICIARY committee has held it up. Media? Don't care. Regular media has turned a blind eye. Facebook has blocked our website. Anywhere on reddit in the mainstream sections--posts get deleted or ignored.

Don't end up like me boys. Run for the hills. Don't get married, don't have kids, and don't sit idly by while they sit there and shake us down until we can take no more--like Chris Mackney. This could be your brother, your son, or you. Get the message out. Get out of the bubble. Share, vote, pester the reps/politicians until they get this kind of bullshit fixed. **This is a national shame.**",1.0,1.0,1.0,431.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jjnn0u/today_i_went_to_jail_and_nobody_gives_a_shit/,modernamericanslave

2020-10-28 21:57:30,About Ruth Bader Ginsberg:,"Not long ago someone posted about how RBG had defended men's rights, and upon closer investigation it appears that she was not even involved in the lawsuit, neither as a lawyer or on the bench. But I noticed how little is known about here, even in the MRM there's nothing published. How could this be, the MRM has no concerns about the radical feminist on the Supreme Court? So I started looking. There's not much out there, but I finally found this from July 1993...

What does RBG stand for? Read on...

* https://eagleforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/July1993.pdf

... in the Family:

1. The traditional family concept of husband as breadwinner and wife as homemaker must be eliminated.
2. The Federal Government must provide comprehensive government child-care.
3. The right to determine family residence must be taken away from the husband.
4. Homestead law must give twice as much benefit to couples who live apart from each other as to a husband and wife who live together.
5. No-Fault divorce must be adopted nationally.
6. The government must provide ""paternity"" leave for childrearing as well as maternity leave.
7. The role of motherhood must be restricted to the very few months in which a woman is pregnant and nursing her baby, because having a baby is just a temporary disability (like breaking a leg, which requires a six week cast). Mothers are not entitled to any special benefits or protections for motherhood responsibilities beyond those limited weeks.
8. The law must not assume a woman takes her husband's name upon remarriage.

... in the Military:

1. Women must be drafted when men are drafted.
2. Women must be assigned to military combat duty.
3. Affirmative Action must be applied to equalize the number of men and women in the armed services.

... in Moral Standards:

1. The age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to 12 years old.
2. Bigamists must have special privileges that other felons don't have.
3. Prostitution must be legalized; it is not sufficient to change the law to sex-neutral language.
4. The Mann Act must be repealed; women should not be protected from ""bad"" men.
5. Prisons and reformatories must be sex-integrated.
6. In the Merchant Marine, provisions for passenger accommodations must be sex-neutralized, and women must not have more bathrooms than men.

... in Education:

1. Single-sex schools and colleges, and single sex school and college activities must be sex-integrated.
2. All-boys' and all-girls' organizations must be sex-intregated because seperate-but-equal organizations perpetuate stereotyped sex roles.
3. Fraternities and sororities must be sex-integrated.
4. The Boy Scouts, The Girl Scouts, and other Congressionally-chartered youth organizations must change their names and their purposes and become sex-integrated.
5. The 4-H Boys and Girls Clubs must be sex-integrated into 4-H youth clubs.
6. Men and women should be required to salute the flag in the same way.

2020-10-29 03:46:15,FGM in Egypt,"(An Egyptian girl just posted this on a diffrent social media platforms, and I wanted to hear your opinions and spread awareness)

FGM has a long, bloody history with African and Arab women. Some people say it originated in Ancient Egypt; others lean more towards it being a Bedouin Arab tradition. I‚Äôm not here to discuss the origin story of one of the most horrific human rights infarctions on earth. I‚Äôm here to talk about the current feminist struggle against it.

FGM was outlawed in Egypt in June of 2008, and a 2014 survey showed that a whopping 92% of married women and girls between 15 and 49 years old have been subjected to FGM (I will talk more about the inclusion of 15 year olds in official surveys of married women in a post about child brides), and that 72% of these crimes were carried out by doctors. In 2008, a DHS survey of women and girls in the same age range showed that 63% of them were in support of FGM as a practice. Of those 63%, 60% cited husband preference for ‚Äòcleaned‚Äô girls, and 39% cited religious reasons. All of these are easily googleable facts, but these things always sound so clinical when they‚Äôre presented like this. Cold, sterile, detached. So, let‚Äôs get a little deeper into it, shall we?

Girls in Egypt are mutilated anywhere between birth and marriage, but mostly before the age of 15. These are children. Every single year, we have cases of babies, toddlers, children, young women dying from botched mutilations and infections, especially after the 2016 criminalisation of FGM practitioners. Parents will take their daughters to backwater clinics, or have ‚Äòdoula‚Äôs who have no medical experience of any kind visit them at home, and cut into the flesh of their young daughters with non-sterile equipment, often without anaesthesia.

I‚Äôve heard and read first-hand accounts of girls who got topical anaesthesia that wore out halfway through. I‚Äôve heard and read first-hand accounts of girls who were dragged, kicking and screaming, and held down by family and neighbours forcefully as their bodies were torn into. Of girls who bled for days, of girls who had to have their legs bound to each other for weeks, of girls who couldn‚Äôt stop screaming in pain every time they went to the bathroom, to complete apathy and even disgust and anger from their families, of girls who were snarled at for making noise while their bodies were being torn away on their own beds, of girls who still have constant pain over a decade later, of girls who hate themselves and hate their vulvas, and hate their lives. Of girls who are suicidal, of girls who are terrified of marriage, who have trust issues, who can‚Äôt handle the thought of anyone touching them there again, after the first time being so traumatic and painful and horrifying. All of this is done while the family, and even friends and neighbours, celebrate in joy. It‚Äôs even tradition in some rural areas to take all the female children of the family to get ‚Äòfixed‚Äô together, dressed in pretty dresses and fancy shoes.

I‚Äôve also heard of women who are asexual due to trauma, whose husbands rape them continuously, who are abused for refusing sex, whose families disown them for being such a disgrace, whose husbands divorce them and leave them for dead, whose husbands marry multiple women besides them, and they are left to fend for themselves, unable to get a divorce and move on, and completely abandoned by the people they trusted the most. They‚Äôre told the angels will curse them all night for refusing sex, but what about their trauma? What about their feelings? What about them, as people? Nobody cares.

So, how did we get here? There are 3 main reasons.

The ‚Äô‚Äôreligious‚Äô‚Äô folk will cite a (weak) hadith as their proof that FGM is a good, healthy practice. It goes that the prophet saw a woman going to get her daughter cut, and he told her to ‚Äònot cut severely, as that is better for the woman and more preferable to the husband‚Äô. Apart from any implications of misogyny in this hadith, it has been disputed multiple times, along with a couple others in support of FGM. You can read more about that here.

Regardless of the truth of FGM having Islamic support, the reality of the matter is that a huge amount of actual, real life Muslim people cite these hadiths as their reasoning to mutilate their daughters, and everyone sees that as completely justified. The truth of the matter is this: Someone put these hadiths into the public conscience knowing full well they will be used to abuse, maim, hurt, kill women for centuries. Whether that someone was prophet Muhammed himself or later scholars, no one can actually ever know.

The second, more indirectly religious and directly misogynistic reason, is to ensure ‚Äòpurity‚Äô. You see, as I‚Äôve talked about before and as many of you already know, women in Islam and in MENA in general are seen and treated as property. The family‚Äôs honour lies between a woman‚Äôs thighs. A young girl who speaks to boys her age in the most innocent context possible can be subjected to house arrest, beatings, forced stopping of her education, even death, for daring to put the family‚Äôs honour in jeopardy. A girl who has a boyfriend, well‚Ä¶

In a society that places so much value not only on women‚Äôs virginity, but also on their complete removal and separation from the male sex at any cost, it‚Äôs not very surprising that tips and tricks like using FGM to ‚Äòcull a woman‚Äôs sexual desire‚Äô spread like wildfire. Girls are mutilated to make sure they don‚Äôt become wh**es. This is said frankly, openly, it‚Äôs common knowledge. If you refuse to hurt your child in this way, you will be met with disdain and disgust, and even wails of despair, with shock, with animosity. ‚ÄúDo you want her to become like a prostitute and ruin your family name? Do you want her to walk around uncontrolled? Don‚Äôt you know what shame she will bring on you?‚Äù These statements are directed at girls as young as‚Ä¶ in the womb, if you show your dissent early enough.

And the final reason is the least of them to hide under religious pretences, and the most misogynistic: Because this is how men prefer their wives to be.

You might think when I say preference here, I mean it in the way I mean, ‚ÄúOh, I personally prefer brunette hair,‚Äù but you would be sorely mistaken. By prefer here, I mean demand. I mean a man could force his grown wife, through physical force or through abuse, to mutilate her body for his satisfaction. I mean that men will sneer at un-mutilated women. I mean that men will beat their wives on their wedding night to within an inch of her life for ‚Äòcheating‚Äô them if the wives are not mutilated. I mean men will suspect their wives of adultery and murder them, which carries a reduced sentence of ‚Äòtime served during investigation‚Äô, just for the simple act of having intact genitals. I mean men will divorce their wives on their wedding night for being unharmed, for being whole. I mean men will act so entitled to women‚Äôs bodies that they will always have the assumption that the ‚Äòproduct‚Äô they are ‚Äòbuying‚Äô is cut to taste, and they will become violent and aggressive and murderous if they find out this is not the case.

I personally don‚Äôt know whether or not I‚Äôve been mutilated. With such high numbers in Egypt, the likely answer is yes, but I genuinely have no clue. I am not allowed to ask about these things, or I‚Äôll be seen as a loose wh**re. My parents would beat me up and they still wouldn‚Äôt allow me the dignity of knowing whether my own body has been altered against my will. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever find out.

The feminists fighting constantly for tighter regulations, for harsher punishments, for longer sentences; these women are seen as the spawn of the devil. Accusations of loose morals are thrown their way day in and day out. Death threats and rape threats (‚Äôthat‚Äôs what you want anyway isn‚Äôt it?‚Äô) are hurled at them from every direction. They are silenced. They are ridiculed. But they are prevailing. This year, the Egyptian president has decided to alter the FGM laws to cover loopholes, and possibly to increase enforcement. He has also altered the charge set to doctors who perform FGM which results in death from manslaughter to first or second degree murder.

The problem, however, remains in lack of reporting. Ever since the criminalisation of performing FGM in 2016, and the setting of punishments as a minimum of three months‚Äô jail time, to a maximum of 2 years, or a minimum of 1000EGP to a maximum of 5000EGP fines (63.71 to 318.53 USD), and until 2018, and possibly until today, not a single mutilator had been convicted.

Imagine being fined as little as 60 dollars for the permanent mutilation of a little girl‚Äôs body. And even that is not happening.

People refuse to report the monsters who do perform this, despite a 2012 gynaecology convention condemning the practice, and calling it an inhumane act, and stating quite forcefully that it is not a medical procedure, and that it is an infringement on the human rights of women and girls, which medicine and medical ethics do not condone. And yet, the public opinion remains the same: this is their business, it is not our place to intervene. It is not our place to get this fine young man thrown in jail, or fined, for performing a¬†‚Äòcleaning‚Äô procedure, and besides, wouldn‚Äôt you rather they had a medical professional perform it, rather than an uneducated woman, or a barber, or a butcher? It is not our place to report this family and tear them apart -¬† what did they ever do to us that we may hurt them like this?

No one ever asks what little girls have ever done for us to fail them like this.",1.0,1.0,1.0,27.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jjuvpo/fgm_in_egypt/,artsygirl22

2020-10-29 05:47:45,Tips and Tricks for Avoiding False Allegations,"Some people have said the Rudy Giuliani Borat scene is a reminder that the ‚ÄúPence rule‚Äù is the best way to avoid any sort of false allegations or the appearance of wrongdoing. Aka only be alone with your wife. Obviously, not everyone is married, and not everyone wants to wait until marriage to have sex. What are some ways you all have found to decrease the odds of getting Me Too‚Äôd / falsely accused?

Obviously there‚Äôs no way to completely avoid the possibility, given the ever expanding definitions of ‚Äúmisconduct‚Äù and given some people are just crazy. But even before Me Too, some older guys told me little things they did. For example, if the condom is in your bottom drawer, point it out and have the woman be the one to open the drawer and grab it. Or if you grab the condom, set it in front of the other person and have her be the one to open the condom and put it on you. I feel like guys need to be armed with some sort of things like this in their defense if they are ever accused*

*Have to add the caveat that if you are accused, it‚Äôs your word against hers and you‚Äôre likely screwed. But having some sort of habit that you always do that indicates she consented can create an opportunity for the other person to back out if she wants to and save your ass from a Me Too situation",1.0,1.0,1.0,39.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jjx66h/tips_and_tricks_for_avoiding_false_allegations/,majormajorsnowden

2020-10-30 04:52:42,How to talk to my husband about circumcision..,"We just found  out we are having  a boy. Now the only thing that disappointed  me about  this is I knew   we'd have to decide  to circumcise him or not. 

I'm not trying  to paint  this story as an ""argument  for'' I want to share why my husband  wants to circumcise  his son, and I'm hoping  maybe  someone  else on here might relate  in a way to gently  help me help him change his mind. 

My husband  was severely  bullied  in school, one of the things he got picked on was being  intact. It's made him very self conscious  about  his penis. On top of that hes struggled  with infections  and eczema around  there. (Please  dont rebut this part with the idea that hes a dirty dude. He washes it, I swear) He resents his mom for not getting him circumcised as an infant. I'm not sure  why he hasn't  gotten  it done now. Might have been because  he was in the military for a long time and didn't  trust the VA, but it's not like I was going  to bring it up as it's his junk. 

Anyway  once we found  out our baby was a boy I asked if we were still circumcising. He said yes. I was a bit surprised  as I know  hes watched the 'Adam ruins everything' video on circumcision. So I thought  maybe  he might have changed. I gently  tried to point  out that kids aren't  getting  circumcised  as much now days so we don't  really  know  if our baby would  even  get teased like he did.  He still firmly  said no it was happening.  I didn't  push it at the moment since I could tell by his voice he was about  to get emotional. But now I just can't  stop thinking  about  it.  I'm not completely  against  it, but I'm not really  for it either. I understand  my husband's  sensitivity  towards it but his problems might not be his son's.  I'm going  to see if I can get him to watch some circumcise documentary  on Amazon  I heard about. But is there anything  else I could  do to help him ease off wanting  this done? Or am I blowing  this up and maybe  it's not that big of a deal. I looked  up the stats in our state and 74% of infant males  are circumcised so I guess it's  still common ?",1.0,1.0,1.0,61.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jkihi3/how_to_talk_to_my_husband_about_circumcision/,CrazyKitty2016

We are told it's natural to explore sexuality... It does no harm. I am here to tell you it does, and many of my friends and others my age agree. It warps your mind. It takes your will...

You don't learn anything from pornography. If you think you are... You will be very dissapointed in real life. Sex is more than just the immediate physical act. There's connection, intimacy and romance. You ruin so many experiences you were meant to discover in real life.. What a woman's gasp sounds like, the excitement of exploring a woman's body.. It's all tainted by images we expose ourselves to prior.

The sexual exploration is not as healthy as proclaimed... For some, sure. But for many more the novelty of porn lures you into much darker varieties. It desensitizes you. You need more and more... Even if you do find a partner, porn somehow urges you to take sex further. Normal sex isn't fulfilling.. You ask your partner to engage in more fetish and risky behaviors... ED is real.

Besides just sex... Porn warps the way we see women in general. In everyday life they become objects of sexual pursuit. You lose mind of what a woman really is... Another awesome beautiful soul to enjoy life with.

- Quick point - porn goes across all genders and preferences.. I speak of my experience only, and from one perspective to keep it simple.

Lastly... If you feel uncomfortable walking into a strip club... What about a live sex show? What makes consuming such material behind a screen any different? It doesn't...

Frankly, I know this is an unpopular opinion on here. I am not calling for the removal of everything sexual. We do need to open up the sexual conversation. But all I can do is hope to help at least a few behind me from making the same mistakes. Porn does nothing for you.

2020-10-30 15:41:10,"The Great Intimate Partner Violence Swindle, part CCCXLVII: Intimate Terrorism","Wikipedia's article on IPV is mostly feminist garbage. It also seems to be more or less censored so that facts can't interfere with the feminist narrative. Namely, I interpret the following to mean that they want to  keep all the lies in this and other feminist articles by sanctioning i.e. censoring those who try to remove them: 

&gt; The Arbitration Committee has authorized uninvolved administrators to impose discretionary sanctions on users who edit pages related to (a) GamerGate, (b) any gender-related dispute or controversy, (c) people associated with (a) or (b), all broadly construed, including this article.

But that's expected and not worth writing about. And it's even possible that I'm wrong and sane people just don't edit these feminist articles. There are, after all, a lot of objective sources on IPV that paint a totally different picture than this crazy men-bashing tirade. Why don't we find them on Wikipedia?

Anyway, I took a deeper look at  one of the core concepts, [Intimate terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intimate_partner_violence#Intimate_terrorism), the feminist concept that has turned into [a criminal offense in the UK](https://www.cps.gov.uk/legal-guidance/controlling-or-coercive-behaviour-intimate-or-family-relationship). According to Wikipedia:
&gt; Intimate terrorism, or coercive controlling violence (CCV), occurs when one partner in a relationship, typically a man, uses coercive control and power over the other partner,[6][31][32] using threats, intimidation, and isolation. CCV relies on severe psychological abuse for controlling purposes; when physical abuse occurs it too is severe.[32] In such cases, ""[o]ne partner, usually a man, controls virtually every aspect of the victim's, usually a woman's, life.""[citation needed] Johnson reported in 2001 that 97% of the perpetrators of intimate terrorism were men.[7]

So, how do we know that it's almost always men who do these horrible things? The source for these claims is - probably deep personal traumas but also - research done by a women's studies professor called Michael P. Johnson. The Wikipedia article cites a different source but original 97% figure comes from him.

[Here's](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238509810_The_case_against_the_role_of_gender_in_intimate_partner_violence) an article describing the problems with the ""gender paradigm"" in violence studies by Donald G. Dutton. Below he describes the methodology of Johnson and other feminists, which ""is intended not to discover the truth about IPV but instead to prove a political theory"":

&gt; Intimate terrorism

&gt; Johnson's work ... is also quite clear about the biased choice of methodology: **""I chose one question to determine whether the husband and/or the wife had been violent, as reported by the wife""** (2008, p. 20). The implication of this research choice is that Johnson trusts only women's versions of events and bases his entire typology of patterns of IPV on this version. Johnson makes no assessment of whether the reports he obtains under these conditions are veridical or are self serving inflations of victimization or enhanced with stories overheard from other shelter clients. He does not know. Is it any wonder then that ""intimate terrorism"" depicted by this sample appears male perpetrated, or involves ""violent resistance"" (i.e. self defense) in women. 

Dutton also argues quite convincingly that possibly ""intimate terrorism"" is more typical to women: 

&gt; Johnson argues that surveys tap ""situational couple violence"" but not intimate terrorism (Johnson, 2011), p. 290, 294). However, Stets and Straus (1989) found that 15% of their respondents who reported any abuse, reported a pattern where one spouse used severe violence against a non-violent spouse, consistent with intimate terrorism. Ten percent of these perpetrators against a non-violent spouse were women, the other 5% were men. It also found, as did a more recent large sample survey (D. J. Whitaker et al., 2007) that bidirectional assault was the most frequent pattern reported. 

And [here's](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251667721_Gender_and_Types_of_Intimate_Partner_Violence_A_Response_to_an_Anti-Feminist_Literature_Review) Johnsons's detailed response to Dutton's original article criticizing feminist violence research. Feminists apparently decided to save their ""men are violent and power-hungry pigs beating up women"" theory by claiming that research just doesn't really find these pigs in large quantities, but they still are there trust me.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jksha0/the_great_intimate_partner_violence_swindle_part/,accidental_me

2020-10-30 19:10:50,Men afraid of women at work,"I posted it on askfeminists, and was accused of being 'MRA propagandist'. Probably I have to post it there instead.

--------------

There is evidence of a growing number of men, who avoid women in the workplace, avoid being one on one, avoid mentoring women. This hurts women. 

https://nypost.com/2019/05/17/men-are-afraid-to-mentor-women-after-metoo-and-it-hurts-us-all-study/

I read a number of articles on that topic. Another example:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/pragyaagarwaleurope/2019/02/18/in-the-era-of-metoo-are-men-scared-of-mentoring-women/

There is a common pattern. Authors ignore and dismiss concerns of men, they give their own explanations of the experiences, feelings and motives of these men, in condescending and scolding manner and shift the topic to empowering women, defeating bias against women and improving career opportunities for women. So basically men should shut up, stop whining and do their best to help women advance. I'd say, it is basically womansplaining.

I know, that feminism is about women's issues, not about troubles of men. That's fair enough, I totally accept this approach. So let's assume these papers are supposed to fix the problem for women, defeat the backlash against metoo. However, let's see what kind of message does it deliver to these men, who are afraid of women at the workplace? 

Men aren't listened to. Their concerns and point of view are ignored. Men aren't entitled to be treated with dignity and feeling of security. Men are an instrument for the advance of  women... 

So if a man is afraid of women, he receives a message that his fears are completely valid.

Edit:

So. How would you approach that problem (men silently ignoring women, because they are afraid)?",1.0,1.0,1.0,384.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jkut2w/men_afraid_of_women_at_work/,WanabeInflatable

2020-10-31 02:01:09,"How do you go about expressing yourself, in regards to these issues?","The more I think about this the more difficult it seems... You can't really protest, because we knows feminists don't respond well to that. When you speak out people usually step on you. I was thinking about getting involved in Bloodstained Men's protests next year (assuming they come to Philadelphia) but that seems fairly narrow in terms of issues. I want a general men's rights protest.  

So I was thinking about making an egalitarian platform on YouTube to express my frustration on this stuff, predominately for advocacy purposes. But even if I make my content as palpable and informative as possible most people will avoid it for even insinuating that I could be trying to help men. 

I've been writing a lot about the subject, but it's not helping really. The more I read the more this stuff infuriates me. I need to express my views somehow

Ideally I would be outside protesting right now. I really wish there was some kind of method to organize locally. I don't think any centralized institution exists though, for that kind of thing. So maybe I should actually make an effort to establish a local organization?

That seems awfully ambitious. But I'm motivated enough 

in general though I really just need a way to express this anger. If not advocacy, just for that purpose. I tried speaking to my female therapist about this stuff and she started getting concerned that I would become violent. Asking me all these questions about my mental health. I'm not a mental patient.... I see things very clearly. You just get the impression that no one understand or cares.

2020-10-31 02:43:30,How would you raise your daughter to understand equality?,"While grown women are responsible for their own actions, they were also raised by a family and society that instilled certain destructive values in them that would lead them to feel certain ways about men, what is expected of men, and what is expected or tolerable in women.

how would you raise your daughter to counteract this?

additionally, how would you raise your daughter to be both vigilant against assault while also not creating fear of all men in general? how do you toe the line between safety and not generalizing all men as predators?

I think just being a great, supportive, emotionally vulnerable, invested, and interested father alone goes a long way to proving not all men are bad but do they still need to be aware of safety as well and not blindly trust any man? and where is that line?

additionally, a relationship with your SO is the model by which a child will often develop their own relationships but this isn't always so. for example, my grandparents were the shining example of love, devotion, and patience, yet my mother only dated/married violent abusers, so where did the disconnect happen?

2020-10-31 05:55:27,How Men are Re-Traumatized When they Look For Help,"*I posted this in* r/MensLib *but since it is a pro-feminist subreddit, I think here is a better place for a discussion on how the core beliefs of feminism work together with the ""patriarchy"" to hurt men. (Discussion at the Bottom)*

To preface this post, I'm trying to provide more awareness for male victims of domestic violence and how they are treated, in general, when they seek help.

It's a bit of a touchy subject and not often talked about and I think the only way to spur change is to be open to the experiences and conversations of men who have endured this.

I'm also spreading awareness on my Instagram (male\_liberation).

All the quotes come from this [article.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/#!po=7.35294)

**Experience with DV help resources**

*‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt really listen to what I said. They* ***assumed that all abusers are men and said that I must accept that I was the abuser***\*. They ridiculed me for not leaving my wife,\* ***ignoring the issues about what I would need to do to protect my 6 children*** *and care for them.‚Äù (Experience with a DV agency)*

*‚Äú\[T\]hey offered to listen if I wanted to recount what had happened \[sic\], but indicated that* ***no support services were available.****‚Äù (Experience with DV hotline)*

*‚ÄúI was mostly just doing research after the occurrence \[sic\] to find out what I should do. I found mostly* ***female help sites and was turned down by several so I gave up***\*.‚Äù (Experience using online resources)\*

**Experiences with Police**

*‚ÄúThey determined she was the aggressor but said* ***since I was a man it was silly to arrest her***\*.‚Äù\*

*‚ÄúTold me to get her help.* ***Told me to spend the night in a hotel.****‚Äù*

*‚Äú****They saw me \[sic\] as a large male and‚Ä¶took her side****. I was at the* ***hospital with bruising and burned eyes from hot coffee thrown in them***\*. They didn‚Äôt believe that she did this‚Ä¶and\* ***refused to arrest her***\*‚Ä¶ The next incident‚Ä¶the police‚Ä¶**saw me bleeding they charged her with felony DV but later dropped it to misdemeanor assault because we are not married and do not live together.**‚Äù\*

**General Statistics on the Experience of Male Victim who seek Help (from the Results section)**

\*\*\*""\*\*\**A large proportion of those who sought help from DV agencies (49.9%), DV hotlines (63.9%), or online resources (42.9%) were told,* ***‚ÄúWe only help women.‚Äù***

*""further, 95.3% of those men (n=81) said that they were given the impression that the* ***agency was biased against men***\*.""\*

*""Over 25% of those using an online resource reported that they were given a phone number for help which* ***turned out to be the number for a batterer‚Äôs program.****""*

*""The results from the open-ended questions showed that 16.4% of the men who contacted a hotline reported that the* ***staff made fun them***\*, as did 15.2% of the men who contacted local DV agencies.""\*

*""In 54.9% of cases, the* ***partner was determined to be the primary aggressor***\*. Among those 62 men, 41.5% said the police asked the helpseeker if he wanted his partner arrested; 21% reported the police\* ***refused to arrest the partner***\*, and 38.7% indicated the\* ***police said there was nothing they could do and left***\*.""\*

**Limitations of this Study (You can read more in the actual study)**

I think it would be disingenuous if I just posted this here without discussing some limitations. This was an exploratory study because it is truly the first of its kind because it dives into an analysis of the experiences of male victims of domestic violence. Many of the victims were found online and in spaces where men talk about domestic violence. From the Study:

&gt;The sample was recruited from multiple sources, including the Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men and Women (DAHMW), a national helpline specializing in men who sustain IPV; through ads on online websites, newsletters, blogs, and listservs that specialize in IPV, male IPV victims, fathers‚Äô and divorced men‚Äôs issues, men‚Äôs health, men‚Äôs rights; and through a description of the study on the Wikipedia page about domestic violence. Potential participants were told and advertisements stated: ‚ÄúResearchers at Clark University are conducting a new study on men who experience physical aggression from their female girlfriends, wives, or partners. If you are a man between the ages of 18‚Äì59, have experienced physical aggression from your partner within the past 12 months, and have sought help for this problem, you may be eligible to participate in this study. We invite you to follow this link to complete an Internet survey.‚Äù

They also had to meet the eligibility criteria that are specified in the report.

Despite this, there is the possibility that some respondents' reports are not completely genuine though the authors note that it would be irresponsible to claim that even a majority of the reports are falsehoods.

As I said, this study is the first of its kind. There isn't much attention/funding put towards studying male victims of intimate partner violence at all, even though it's pretty clear that men and women experience IPV. Furthermore, men are discouraged by the experiences of other men, a loss of ""masculinity"", feelings of shame, and the stigma that only women can be victims.

**Compared to the experiences of Women**

Even though I'd like to talk about this within a non-comparative framework, I've always noticed that discussions about men's issues tend to be mixed with conversations about how these experiences compare with women's experiences.

It is clear that women have starkly different experiences with social services for IPV. You can read more in the Discussion section

&gt;These findings are in stark contrast to ratings of social services by battered women. For example, in a study of 119 women who sought services for DV-related concerns from a DV shelter, 89% of the clients believed that they were helped by the services that they received and 84% reported that they felt better because of these services

([Source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1049731507307790?casa_token=hKvt2ogkLXkAAAAA:Q9Yz8vMDNb2OyCuyiN7w8hbVB2F69pva4Q6j68xdj-DHsYBQS6Fi8Vq5nUWXI-dHMkZLdfl2MHyMbcE))

And despite the prevailing narrative against police and handling IPV, women tend to be more satisfied with police assistance.

&gt;Similar results with regard to satisfaction among battered women have been found in relation to police assistance. For example, one study of 95 female IPV victims indicated that the female victims found the police to be very helpful and 80% would contact the police again for assistance.

([Source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801203255554?casa_token=wUzAVe3qIXQAAAAA:kZpKAgGPi7FGuq_M6oU50FDwttugfWq5vh-c9lDMSE0dgmemxeLR-5BpU3SbjKNWPcthz2h_4Bx7TSM))

**Yes, Feminism plays a role in minimizing Male Victimization**

Its no surprise, to anyone, that the Patriarchy hurts men. It is also no surprise, to anyone except closed-minded Feminists (who probably refuse this notion), that the Feminist view of IPV (the prevailing narrative of how IPV works), also hurts male victims of DV. 

The prevailing narrative surrounding IPV is that IPV is a [function of the patriarchy.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/107780102762478055) 

Despite nearly 3[0 years of gender symmetry](https://www.academia.edu/33839193/Thirty_Years_of_Denying_the_Evidence_on_Gender_Symmetry_in_Partner_Violence_Implications_for_Prevention_and_Treatment)[ in the occurrence of IPV](https://www.academia.edu/33839193/Thirty_Years_of_Denying_the_Evidence_on_Gender_Symmetry_in_Partner_Violence_Implications_for_Prevention_and_Treatment), despite women [feeling more helped by social services](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1049731507307790?casa_token=hKvt2ogkLXkAAAAA:Q9Yz8vMDNb2OyCuyiN7w8hbVB2F69pva4Q6j68xdj-DHsYBQS6Fi8Vq5nUWXI-dHMkZLdfl2MHyMbcE), despite [police assistance being more helpful for female victims](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801203255554?casa_token=wUzAVe3qIXQAAAAA:kZpKAgGPi7FGuq_M6oU50FDwttugfWq5vh-c9lDMSE0dgmemxeLR-5BpU3SbjKNWPcthz2h_4Bx7TSM), despite men being laughed out, shamed out, and mocked out of getting assistance for being victims of IPV by both police and social services, and [despite women receiving way more funding for IPV social services/care (men only receiving assistance - 2% of what women get - if they are batterers)](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1226&amp;context=honors), feminist writers, researchers, and activists [still believe that giving attention to male victims of female perpetrators will take away from female victims.](https://books.google.com/books?id=YBVGswoPYqMC&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) (Yes - that is Chapter 5 in a *Textbook on the subject*). 

It is clear to me, that feminist desire to cling to their ideological standpoint on female victimhood and male aggression active works together with the prevailing narrative surround IPV, to ***retraumatize male victims by denying them service, marking them as predators and reducing the ability to help male victims in favor of women's victims.*** 

This is the dark side of feminism. This is the side of feminism that is about punishing men for who they are.

**Conclusion**

Intimate Partner Violence is a huge issue for men, and much of the prevailing narrative surrounding male victims re-traumatizes them instead of helping.

She felt insicure about herself. See ? You can make an excuse for anything. So men, if you are going thru a rough patch, it's the nature of the beast, roll with it and try to move on ! If you're down find a hobby and make it your goal. Buy a small stone cutter and start making different cubes or something. You don't need a lot of money for a hobby.

So as per a study done by Daily Mail, stifle your laughter, 50% of women have a plan B. Around 1,000 women appeared for the survey and some of them also said that Plan B could be somebody whom they have known since as long as seven years. Meanwhile, one in ten women also said that their Plan B had confessed their feelings to them already.  More than four out of ten women, in fact, said that they familiarized with the other man or Plan B during their existent relationship.

2020-10-31 13:16:50,The Echo Chamber,"So over the last months, I've noticed a trend.

My Reddit front page has been taken over by MRA posts. Even though I subscribe to something like 50 subreddits... the top 10 articles on my Reddit feed always contains 2 or 3 MRA issues. Reddit is drowning out all of my other interests and showing me a disproportionate amount injustice towards men.

This has had a profound impact on my psyche. I've started collecting facts and articles and curating them. Carefully organizing my counter arguments. I was constantly feeling triggered. Everytime I hear the word patriarchy or misogyny or the phrase wage gap. Everytime I see a black woman or a gender studies student I just expected the worst. I started to feel like everywhere all I saw was cancel culture hate speech against white men. This warped perception of reality was being fueled by my Reddit feed and bringing out the worst in me all the time. I felt trapped.

What I've come to realize since then is that if we allow the sexism and hate speech to control our thoughts and provoke us, we're letting them win. Adopting this perspective has lead to a realization that more and more women recognize that feminism is heading down a dark path. Seriously, when I stopped attacking, women started admitting they weren't so certain about this stuff. Especially older women over 30 universally question aspects of third wave feminism.

We're winning gents. Hearts and minds are shifting. If it's hard to see it, try not to look so hard. It might help. Stay classy and choose to fight the fights that are winnable.

2020-11-01 04:52:49,The actual reason some men idolize anti-heroes.,"I‚Äôm sure most of you have seen the ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre missing the point by idolizing them‚Äù meme that includes characters like Walter White, Jordan Belfort, Arthur Fleck aka Joker, Tony Montana, etc. but I‚Äôve always wondered, *what exactly* makes some people disregard the obvious and overwhelming negative qualities of these characters and think of them as personal heroes? I mean there must be a more nuanced and complex explanation other than it being a symptom of Jung‚Äôs Shadow? After all, everyone has The Shadow, but only a few people - mostly men - actually look up to them in a way that is beyond a repressed, primitive desire for dominance and destruction. So, what might it be?
Well, I personally believe that the idolization of the male anti-hero is what happens when you add up two enormeous societal issues; a lack of father figures/pretty much destruction of the family unit by the exclusion of fathers and the utter apathy that men experience in regards to any hardships they face as a result of them being viewed as disposable. When these young men realize that society views them as just another tool, just another money bag, just another pair of hands to work to death, they‚Äôre obviously going to fall into a deep pit of nihilism and depression. So what do they do? They look for answers, they look for guidance. And as young men, they instinctively expect these things from their fathers, but since we collectively decided that fathers don‚Äôt matter, and the crisis of masculinity we‚Äôre living in doesn‚Äôt produce the best fathers, these young men don‚Äôt find their fathers, therefore they don‚Äôt find the answers they seek to their most important questions about their worth, about how they can find their worth, what are they worth and what they should be. And when you don‚Äôt have an adequate father in your life, you look for a father-figure, but it‚Äôs not like healthy father-figures are in abundance either (same reason as for lack of good fathers basically) and thus, when you don‚Äôt have something in real life, you look for it in fiction. These fictional men, these fictional father-figures display another type of masculinity. They exploit the system that they feel exploits working men (see Jordan Belfort, Patrick Bateman) and do as they please, not listening to moral or even legal authority. They create their own rules, their own worth, and acquire absolute power in the process. Other types, like Arthur Fleck completely live outside of social norms, and you could say society itself, while lashing out against it and mocking both the written and unwritten rules that result in the critical condition of these young men, according to them, at least. Now, their toxic traits, their drunkenness on power, their egos, their incredible pride and contempt for other people? That‚Äôs all irrelevant to these young men. All they see is power, meaning in power, the *answers* in power. They look up to that power and the individuals who possess and act as a symbol for it because it‚Äôs the only thing they can look up to. Everything else has fallen to the ground and is being stepped on by people walking to their jobs every morning.

So two nights ago I was sitting in my room at 12:30 AM and since my roommate (the new woman) had been gone all day I figured I‚Äôd be safe to masturbate, now I always do it with the blanket covering and nothing is exposed, I had the door closed and had just opened PH when the door opened, she walked in, and saw PH open, I had not even gotten undressed in my bed when this had happened but she freaked out. Which was acceptable, I apologized profusely and said it wouldn‚Äôt happen again because I knew she had past trauma, she said she didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with me in the room which I acknowledged so I slept on the couch out of embarrassment and stayed at a different house last night. Tonight we had a Halloween party where I saw my brother and he pulled me outside for a talk. ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm sorry to do this but we have a zero tolerance expectation for exposing yourself, I‚Äôm sorry but you can‚Äôt be in the house, I don‚Äôt know what you want me to do, you and I can move out and get a studio apartment if we need to because I‚Äôm not gonna abandon my brother but you had your dick out and were masturbating in the same room as her, you show she was raped before man, and then you try and blame her?!‚Äù and I said that was a lie, I never started it, I was certainly never exposed, and I left immediately after she said she was uncomfortable... but yeah, I‚Äôve been evicted for something I didn‚Äôt do",1.0,1.0,1.0,21.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jlv3db/ive_been_evicted_for_masturbating_when_i_wasnt/,PyroTheAlpha

2020-11-01 14:22:12,"An angry feminist tells how she became a feminist and how good, ""full of joy and clarity"" it felt to start hating.","Moira Weigel begins her article *[Down Girl by Kate Manne review ‚Äì #MeToo and the logic of misogyny](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2017/dec/20/down-girl-kate-manne-review)* by revealing the psychology behind radical feminism in troubled young girls:

&gt; When I first found feminism, and felt furious about everything, my mother tried to calm me down: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to walk around angry all the time.‚Äù The thing was, I did. The anger I found with feminism was full of joy and clarity. It felt infinitely better than the emotions that came before it: anxiety, aloneness, self-doubt, suspicion of other women that made me look their friendship in the mouth ‚Äì when, really, we were natural allies. The childish part was to direct my anger at people I loved, and who loved me, because the world that they had worked so hard to launch me into was compromised, and they should have known. But the whole damn system was guilty as hell, and to say so felt like a relief.

By the way, I decided to skim through the Down girl book. Yes, I know, it will be horrible - that's why I stopped reading feminist books years ago. But I happen to have the book at hand and, hell, the trauma can't be that big for a big man like me. :D

Men are guardians!

Women however have never created or invented anything over the ordinary and women also have trouble operating daily activitys a man can do with ease such as driving a car or being able to act maturely and in control of their emotions.

Women however complains on men for not being enough while they cheat on men, lie to men, get men killed or jailed, and treat men as if they were some greedy creature with a huge ego that they fuel with short temporary ego boost such as being a h0e to get attention, validation or any other respectless act which is ironic because that‚Äôs exactly what some women are.

And they say kill all men? Lol.

There‚Äôs a reason the bible clearly states that man should rule over women after dealing out the punishment of eve eating the apple. This is not news, our ancestors have lived with women for millions of years and passed along this human trait rule to us present males.

Look at the big picture and understand what position you have as a man and how horrible the majority of women are today. Evil, greedy and slaves of their addictions and big ego.

Dont let women teach you how to be a ‚Äùman‚Äù and shape you to a simp/beta male that is submissive to their greedy selfish needs by lynchmobbing.

Being a man is standing your ground and knows from right and wrong, knows when to show respect and when to not.

There‚Äôs a reason some women like to be treated like shit without the respect, because that‚Äôs exactly what some of them are.

When's the last time you heard society call a woman a deadbeat mom ? 

When's the last time you heard society call a man a deadbeat dad ?

This puts pressure on some men to either not ask for child support or it just increases stress levels for no reason. Shall I remind you men suicides are at a all time high ? 

17.200.000 children live with mothers only.

3.000.000 children live with fathers only.

If you use both articles and superimpose the data we get : 7,396,000 women who don't pay child support.

960,000 men don't pay child support ! 

Deadbeat women surpass deadbeat dads by 7.7x ! That's seven point seven times more !

Even in the rare instance where the mother is ordered to pay child support, courts are not ordering women to pay as much as male providers. Annual child support payments averaged $5,450 from male providers and $3,500 from female providers, nearly 56% less. Not taking into account the fact that many times the man loses his home and 50% of his belongings to start with ! Next time a woman says that deadbeats dad are common, just show them these statistics ! They outnumber men by a wide margin ! 

&amp;#x200B;

Take this with a grain of salt but even if you find different statistics the difference won't be that much different ! What are your thoughts ? 

&amp;#x200B;

2020-11-03 08:33:23,Don't do No Nut November," There's literally no reason you as a man should partake in abstaining from ejaculation for 30 days, it not only fucks up your hormones there's no long term studies to say if it's healthy for both mental health or health in general.

Men already have low T in our culture, don't add to it by being a dumbass and following some internet trend.

&gt;In both men and women, testosterone levels were highest after intercourse. Levels were lower before sex and on days with no intercourse. These results suggest that sexual activity influences testosterone rather than testosterone influencing sexual activity.

[https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325418#short-and-long-term-effects](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/325418#short-and-long-term-effects)

And this also takes away support and conversations for Movember an actual movement to support prostate cancer in men.

[https://ca.movember.com/](https://ca.movember.com/)

This actually goes against the studies found between healthy prostate health and ejaculation:

&gt;In all, men who averaged 4.6‚Äì7 ejaculations a week were 36% less likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer before the age of 70 than men who ejaculated less than 2.3 times a week on average.

We know that today, even as male victimizations are only now beginning to be taken more seriously, an estimated 97% of cases are still never reported.

[https://youtu.be/iPnPHkyN-KY](https://youtu.be/iPnPHkyN-KY) Pilot Episode

This is my first attempt of focusing (self-improvement) some negative energy into something positive. To many articles and to many statistics that will bring a brother down ! Some people get hobbies, others can't...I believe there is a way. No matter how down you may feel, there is something out there that's for you. Going to the gym, playing video games, joining this helpful group, anything that helps keep the mind occupied. New challenges, small or big, doesn't matter !

I'm trying to merge creepypasta with men's stories, be them anecdotal or not ! Something new...

Keep in mind reading is not the same as watching the video.

I'm narrating a made up story in the video of an ex-husband that gives an insight into his ex-wife life after the divorce. If you don't like Youtube, this is the story :

"" Not many details are known about the life of a divorced woman other than the obvious. They generally keep to themselves, it's said than even discussing about them attracts unwanted attention. That being said a recently divorced friend of mine gave me an insight into the life of such creatures and quite frankly now I wished I didn't asked. He told me a story about what happened to her new boyfriend who was just 21. They decided to go on a vacation to celebrate her freedom from the patriarchy together with some of her friends. The same friends who had a hand in her divorce, telling her how she should be free and that she needs to find herself. She took her new boyfriend and friends to the same place her now ex-husband proposed, probably because of some sort of ritual. It seems that she insisted on separate tents for all of them, after all they where in the middle of nowhere and had plenty of space, the boyfriend being the youngest of the group accepted without questions, in part because he was not yet accustomed to her doings. On the 3rd day of the trip the new boyfriend woke up before everybody else and went outside his tent. Not wanting to wake anybody up he went for a stroll to stretch his legs. The Sun wasn't quite up yet but there was enough light to see one's surroundings. Other than his better half and her friends there wasn't a soul to be found for tens of miles. Just nature, birds waking up and starting to sing, a breeze that smelled of fresh pine cones and the sound of the river in the distance. Paradise. Then something happened : the calm atmosphere shifted, the air around him became to dense to move, the sound of the birds became the lamentations of his soul. (WHAT HAVE YOU DONE ?)The tree figures merged into one big shadow filled with rage and then...silence. A strange sense of dread overcame him and compelled him to turn right. There, 100 feet from him in a small forest opening stood a females figure, more accurately her naked figure right next to somebody else. Their body's seemingly superimposed under the dim light of the not risen Sun. They where looking at him while slowly moving back and forward. He froze for what he felt was an eternity. Could they actually see him ? Or where they just positioned that way. He decided to go back to his tent and worn the others that they where not alone. After what felt like ages walking, he reached the tents and woke everybody up. That's when he realized two tents where empty. He immediately got in his car leaving everything behind and never looked back. And that is the reason why nobody talks about what happens after a divorce.""

2020-11-03 11:19:23,"Why are male rape victims in war not just ignored, but also demonized as misogynistic and/or homophobic?","I've been reading about the subject extensively over the last few days and it's absolutely haunting. Despite almost zero reporting or recognition for the pervasiveness of this phenomenon, with absolutely no funding for treatment, it's somehow traced back to ""misogyny"". From the few small amount of papers published on the subject, they often remark that the emasculation is a product of *internalized misogynistic tendencies*, because the consequence of destroying a man's sense of masculinity implies that homosexuality and femininity are inherently immoral. 

I really can't express how angry this makes me. 

They often remark that women are naturally the main victims of the act (sigh), therefore excusing the lack of support. But they often contradict themselves by emphasizing the social stigma surrounding being raped as a man, by another man. 

They go over men being brutally gang raped in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, castrated, sodomized, kept as sex slaves,  as a method to destroy the man's sense of masculinity. Apparently, it's very effective in warfare. It essentially destroys your ability to function on any level. You are relegated to an inferior position in the DRC and regarded as what natives would describe as a ""bush wife"". You can no longer protect the tribe, it rescinds all status or respect you had in the community. The intention behind this is to essentially destroy your adversaries identity, and therefore ability to fight. Many commit suicide or can never reach an erection again. Very few are able to seek treatment out of shame. Even by conservative estimates it accounts for roughly 10% of the rapes that occur in the DRC. Considering the overwhelming stigma behind disclosing the crime, it's probably *significantly* higher. 

Somehow they twist this perceived shame into misogyny and homophobia. Because if your raped as a man, have the self-perception of being emasculated or homosexual, and feel existential dread about this, somehow this relates to the patriarchy of course. 

Again, they contradict themselves. Why are these same characteristics common in almost all male-male rape cases? Are all of those men misogynistic homophobic patriarchy rats? 

Just, how the fuck do men getting brutally raped en masse, with absolutely no support, no recognition, no intergovernmental funding or programs, no treatment, no compassion, rampant suicide, this is somehow, indirectly, the man's fault. 

There was another article about the [Abu Ghraib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ghraib_torture_and_prisoner_abuse) sexual violence case perpetrated by U.S military personnel. The author is perplexed by the fact that women participated in the act, and eventually reconciles this by assuming they are victims of the patriarchy (offsetting responsibility onto her superiors) because she was just ""following orders"" by sexually torturing the prisoners. They present masculinity as the driving force behind the rape of these men. So how can a few sugar and spice girls possibly commit wartime atrocities? That's irrational! They could *never* be complicit. I guess all those women that ostracized those male rape victims were also controlled by the patriarchy. 

This lends a lot of credibility to the male disposability theory. Fuck this planet.

2020-11-04 00:35:53,Thinking of voting today? I'd like you to remember this important fact about our sitting POTUS,"BTW, in saying what I'm saying, I don't mean to dismiss criticism of Joe Biden.  Frankly, I think that both candidates are deeply flawed.  I voted early; I would have preferred to be voting for Sanders, but he is not on the ballot; so I am voting *against* Trump.

TL;DR; The POTUS has shown himself to be a total piece of shit with his handling of the covid pandemic, which has a death toll that disproportionately affects men, and men of color and poor men in particular.

As I write this, we have recording nearly 10,000,000 covid infections and 237,000 deaths.  We know that statistically, it has been recorded that for reasons we can only speculate at, that men die with covid more often than women. (One of many sources: https://www.rgare.com/knowledge-center/media/research/covid-19-mortality-rates-by-age-and-gender-why-is-the-disease-killing-more-men-than-women)

It may have been inevitable that this disease would reach our shores, but our POTUS made decisions that costs the lives of thousands of Americans and altered the lives of many for the worse.

At the beginning of this, what happened?  The POTUS said back in February that it was no big deal and that it would go away by Easter.  He painted rosy pictures of packed churches on Easter.  He may as well have been the captain of the Titanic telling the crew not to prepare the lifeboats because everything was okay.

When it became apparent that this was going to be a public health crisis, the POTUS and his operatives prominently refused to model following the simple health advice of wearing a mask.  He even went so far as to criticize people who were masks to prevent the spread of disease by insinuating that rather than trying to protect themselves and others, they wear masks to signal disapproval of him. (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/trump-says-some-wear-coronavirus-masks-to-signal-disapproval-of-him.html)

Also, it appears quite possible that the POTUS criminally mismanaged the allocation of public resources by forcing state and local agencies to bid against each other for the provision of N95 masks and other protective equipment.  It has been reported the federal agencies seized equipment from public and private institutions and speculated that it must have been resold for a profit.  The governor of the state of Maryland revealed that he purchased protective equipment in secret and kept it at an undisclosed location to ensure that it got to the people how needed it.  We have a public health crisis and not only did the federal government refuse to help, they actively sabotaged state and local efforts to help. (https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2020/4/14/21221459/pritzker-secret-flights-china-illinois-ppe-trump-coronavirus)

Some of you may recall the recent reports that a number of individuals were arrested by the FBI for allegedly plotting to kidnap the governor of the state of Michigan.  There were previous reports that armed protesters (read: tacticool) had occupied the Michigan state capitol, and the POTUS tweeted in support of the armed protestors: ""Liberate Michigan"", lending his support to the same people who plotted the kidnapping. (https://www.businessinsider.com/washington-post-3-men-charged-whitmer-kidnap-plot-protested-lockdown-2020-11)

I am aware that some people on this subreddit have said that the so-called ""lockdowns"" in response to covid are worse than the illness itself, that they resulted in mental illness and suicide.  I understand.  I know people, male and female, who have lost well-paying jobs because of the response to covid.  Usually, the argument that the lockdowns are worse than the illness itself come with an implicit argument that the lockdowns never should have happened, and that is fair.

However, many fail to point out how in many countries, governments actually bailed out people whose jobs were put on hold.  For example, I know a British man who received some sort of pension from the government to keep him afloat while his job was temporarily shut down.

In our country, they sent out a single round of ""stimulus"" checks and additional unemployment money and then left us out to dry while Congress went on break.  I just want to make clear to those of you not familiar with the unemployment systems here that many claimants who lost their jobs never received any money at all because the system was so backlogged.

I'm a regular viewer of The Rising Show, and I felt like Saagar Enjeti gave his magnum opus when he said, ""The elites choose to make you suffer"".  Our government gave trillions of dollars to ""bail out"" wealthy institutions while our poorest, must vulnerable citizens died of drug overdoses on the streets. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qm7H3HRdPhg)

There are people who are dead and people who have suffered enormously and invisibly, and by my judgement, our POTUS bears direct responsibility, and we should take this into account when deciding how to vote!

https://gfycat.com/glaringpooriraniangroundjay

Well since I'm old and since I'm male, my shoulders are all jacked up.  I still work out, but I routinely dislocate in my sleep, or sometimes at the gym.  So needless to say, there are days, I'm really not in the mood to git smacked around.

The other day was one of those days, and I flat out rounded on my wife and yelled ""stop fucking hitting me, it hurts"" (and it did).  That day my shoulder was pretty much useless and she made perfect contact in the worse possible way.  She was less than pleased at the confrontation.

Wasn't till that moment that I did an mental inventory of how many times a week I get punched.  It's a lot.  She thinks it's a flirtation I guess it probably was years ago.  Now I'm having to get her to seriously evaluate how she shows her affection.  

Dr. says my shoulder won't hold much longer (old and male), and I'll need surgery soon.  Last thing in the world I need is to get caught on the shoulder with a left jab after dropping $10,000 on a new hardware.

I'm currently working through college to be able to achieve that. Anyways regarding the very draconian divorce laws, I can certainly attest to that. My mom and dad were oil and water, they hated each other, however despite disliking each other their divorce was clean as could be. They basically just took their respective money, personal possessions, and things and went there separate ways. However, the vast majority of men I know who were married were nowhere near as lucky. I work in finance, a field mainly male led, and most of my coworkers and friends of my dad and i's are over the age of 40. Out of about 6 of them 2 have remained happily married with kids, one never got married or had kids, and the other 3 well, 2 of them are on their 3rd marriages and other is going through the worst time out of them all. His ex wife has dragged his name through the mud for several years and is trying to bankrupt and ruin his life and make sure he never sees his daughters again despite the fact she doesn't care about them at all and he cares about them.

2020-11-05 02:21:05,This comment that I read online really pissed me off!,"When I was reading comments on YouTube videos about circumcision (I'm an intactivist, and so I'm against circumcision), I read this one sexist comment about men.

Here's the comment:

**""I think castration on boys shortly after birth should be legal and should be a option made by the parents like how circumcision is. Think about it, a lot of women's lives would be better and safer if most men were castrated, since less¬†women would get raped or murdered and they wouldn't get harassed and stalked by men, and they wouldn't be sexualized in the media and in fiction all the time. Also men tend to be violent because of their testosterone level, so there would be less violence in the world if most men were castrated.¬†And also, if most men were castrated, they also would do better in schools and behave more better. So I¬†think societies would be a way better place if most men were castrated.** 

**And also, the idea I have in order for women to still get pregnant is that have the men who are not castrated paid large amounts of money to donate sperm at sperm banks. Or we can start creating artificial sperm or find another way to get women pregnant without the need of sperm.""**

The person who wrote that comment responded to a reply asking if they are being serious or not, and they said that they were being serious. 

This comment actually received a couple of likes, and some people commented back, saying that they agree with it. 

It seems like our society now thinks that nearly all men are bad, when it's actually only very few men out of the whole male population. It also now seems like our society is now a misandrist society.

It seems that the only way to win is to not play. Men refuse to get married and go their own way. For example in Italy 94% of those paying child support are men ! Things aren't better in the U.S.A .

&gt;Corey has attained a posthumous notoriety in that after her death from AIDS, friends cleaning out her Harlem apartment found not only an expensive wardrobe, but also a trunk containing a mummified body that had been dead for about 25 years. The police eventually were able to extract fingerprints, and identified Robert Worley, who had an arrest for rape and assault. 

&gt;It is assumed that Corey killed the burglar in self-defense, but it is also said that it was her boyfriend who had turned abusive. 

&gt;In either case, she had no idea how to get rid of a body. She moved twice with the body in the trunk.

2020-11-07 06:05:24,Ran over in court,"Hi All - - 

Jesus what a crappy two years I've had, covid aside. 

I made a stupid mistake and dated a woman at the same company I worked at. This company makes a very well known product that you'd recognize instantly if I told you what it was. This is in LA. 

I only dated this woman for two months before I ended things because her behavior was getting very erratic, crazy and at times downright scary. She would scream bloody murder at me for trivial things (for example she found out that I didn't eat a pop tart she had given me one day and completely lost it. She even threatened suicide because of this...). She would also beat herself in the face when she was upset. This is from a woman who appeared completely normal when I first met her. 

Anyways, I break up with her and she starts parking next to me at work every day. She starts putting things on my car. Come to find out she moved 2 miles down the street from me, IN LA, after we broke up. At work she would come to my department and stare at me. She started spending a-lot of time with other guys at work and most likely slept with a couple of them. This bothered me, because there was a time when I really liked this girl. At first I felt bad for her, but then quickly realized that she was a predator in every sense of the word. 

When it became clear to her that I wanted nothing to do with her, she then switched her tune. She started trying to get me in trouble at work. She filed police reports for me over stuff I had not done. She even started following me home from work. Then, she started popping up around my neighborhood at places I would be at. 

I went to management about her on numerous occasions and they eventually sat down and spoke with her. She even ADMITTED to putting stuff on my car, but they didn't fire her. I sh\*t you not. Now, imagine if I had put stuff on her car? LOL, I would have been fired instantly. But she's a female, so I guess the rules don't apply to her. The HR director even told me, behind closed doors of course, that they ""Just didn't want a lawsuit"". 

I kept complaining to them about her and finally they fired me. They said it was due to ""Sale restructuring"". This was 2 months after I had gotten a significant raise and bonus. It was a total cover up. 

So, long story short, I got another job pretty quickly. I was majorly pissed off at what had happened to me at this company, but I was trying my best to just move on a forget it. You know, focus on my new job and just move on. Two months later, I step outside of my apartment to go across the street and get some snacks at the convenience store across the street. Guess who I see? Her and another guy I used to work with slowly drive by me as I'm walking out. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first, but told myself maybe I was just seeing things. But, 2 days later it happened again. I sent her a text and told her to f\*ck off and called her a mentally ill sl\*t, because she is. I even texted the guy who drove by with her that he was more than welcome to get out of the car next time so I could kick his ass. 

A week later, I check my mailbox and find a cease and desist letter from my last company. The letter told me if I even contacted anyone at that job again that I would get sued. I had had enough and went down to the courthouse and filed for a restraining order on her. To my surprise, it was fully granted. The only thing is, in California, you still have to have a hearing to make it permanent. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the day of the hearing comes up and I show up to court alone. I'm thinking this will be easy. She shows up with a lawyer, a bunch of her family members and a new black boyfriend. She gives me this evil smile as she walks into the court. I decide at this point that I need to get an attorney too as she is there claiming I'm the one who's been harassing her. So we have the hearing, at a later date, and her and her family get on the stand and basically make me out to be a monster. They tell the judge that she's deathly afraid of me. Those texts I sent to her and that guy who drove by my place? Yeah, that came back to bite me. The judge kept saying he didn't believe me when I told him how crazy she was. I even had a ton of evidence on her (texts talking about how she hits herself in the face, texts talking about how she put stuff on my car, etc.). I have pictures of her parking next to me at work every day. 

&amp;#x200B;

It didn't matter. My lawyer even called in witnesses from my last company, several people from upper management. They were totally useless. Every other word they said was ""I don't recall"" or ""I don't remember"". When my lawyer asked them about her admitting to putting stuff on my car at work, they all said the same bullsh\*t, ""I don't recall"". 

&amp;#x200B;

So what happens? The judge slaps me with a 4 year protective order. The judge called ME the stalker in court. The only good thing is that it's not a criminal order, it's civil. So it won't show up on a background check for criminal stuff. Also, I already have another job, so I'm not worried about it as far as looking for work goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

The next thing you know, she's all over social media talking about her ""Big win"" in court and how she's now finally able to move on with her life. And of course, all her enablers were congratulating her on social media. 

&amp;#x200B;

I had no idea this kind of evil existed. I mean even while I was waiting to go back to court, this woman was still doing drive bys of my apartment and showing up at places in my neighborhood. The only difference was she was showing up in different cars. They were these real beat up junky looking cars. No idea where she got them from. This was while I had a restraining order on her. 

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm wondering if this is really even over or if she's going to try and get me in further trouble. I have a feeling she might be done now. But you never know.

A little big WARNING sign to men out there : take with you a dog poop bag and put the used condom there and throw it away 10 subway stops from her home , you are protecting your assets !

"" An appeals court said a man can press a claim for emotional distress after learning a former lover had used his sperm to have a baby. But he can't claim theft, the ruling said, because the sperm were hers to keep.

1. Much of what happens outside the box, i.e. happens in marginals is done by men, good and bad.
1. The Bell curve of men is flatter, in general, meaning that there are more anti-social men ""in the tail"" than there are women.
1. Role expectations demand that men have to be providers, and sometimes you fulfill the expectation by becoming a criminal.
1. Many people live in cultures where it's OK for men, but not for women, to become criminals.
1. Plus this one I just read in the book *Behave - The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst*: [Almost half of the prison population has a history of traumatic brain injury] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877065717300258)  according to a meta-analysis!

&gt;Sequencing the genome will tell you about the paternity as a unintended side-effect at no extra cost, unless you take very deliberate special steps to AVOID learning about the paternity.  
&gt;  
&gt;Such deliberate avoidance is actually already the case in some situations; for example schools in Norway deliberately stopped performing certain biological experiments on genetics in high-school, and text-books got edited to specifically de-emphasize information about certain recessive observable traits in humans that'd have the same effect. If both your biological parents have a recessive phenotype, but you do not, then assuming the observation is correct, those two people can't be your biological parents.  
&gt;  
&gt;Sometimes the hospital discovers by accident that the person listed as father can't be the biological father; for example if the bloodtype of the child is an impossibility with him as dad; in such cases they deliberately AVOID informing him about it. Personally I think that's morally wrong, and he does have a moral right to be informed if/when someone has this knowledge, but that's not the current practice.

**Androphobia** is defined as a fear of men. The term originated inside feminist and lesbian-feminist movements to balance the opposite term ‚Äúgynophobia,‚Äù which means a fear of women. Misandry, another term that arose from the feminist and lesbian-feminist movements, is defined as a hatred of men.

Here's articles about it:

I believe there are lots of things feminism has done right, but the recent radicalization and what seems to be a push not for women but against men is not one of them.

They are hurting their cause, our cause and everyone who really seeks an equal society.

It should be anti feminist to say ""women can't be abusers, rapists, or discriminate"" because by doing that you are taking away the human part of women: they can make mistakes, they can have evil intentions, they can be bad people just as we men can, and not recognizing that fact is a direct aggresion to themselves and our seeked equalness.

2020-11-10 08:12:38,What my boyfriend thinks about MRM.,"So I, a woman, asked my boyfriend point blank what he thought about the men‚Äôs rights movement. We‚Äôve never talked about it together before. I thought you guys would find this interesting in terms of the outsider male opinion.

‚ÄúI think they believe that there are certain parts of society that favour women (often superficial things like being bought drinks and ‚Äòbeing able to sleep with whoever you want‚Äô) and that somehow that makes up for the advantage that men enjoy in the majority of society where power and privilege actually exist. I guess I see them fundamentally as against affirmative action for women in having an equal say in how our society functions and being able to escape the subjugation of men. And I don‚Äôt know how you could be against that. And I think it‚Äôs absurd that they can‚Äôt understand their own privilege in being male. And I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll admit it but they see women as owing them something (often because they‚Äôre jaded losers who‚Äôve been rejected too many times).‚Äù

Now, I have to say. My boyfriend is a white, mostly straight doctor. He is attractive and traditionally masculine. He believes in progressivism and is very involved in a lot of social issues including causes against male suicide and raising awareness for men‚Äôs mental health. He openly identifies as a feminist. He has not met an MRA. He has not spent any time on MRA subreddits like I have and his opinion is purely based off hearsay. But I thought you guys would find it interesting to hear what a progressive man believes MRA to be about.",1.0,1.0,1.0,407.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jr9xfr/what_my_boyfriend_thinks_about_mrm/,madtayham

He made it very obvious that he didn‚Äôt want to engage in a relationship but she kept trying and trying. At one stage they met at a party. She got him drunk and had sex with him. WHICH IS RAPE. R A P E RAPE. Anyway he got her pregnant. So what she did was she said that he raped her and took it to court. She obviously won the case because she is a pregnant woman and now for the rest of his life, that man has to live with a criminal record. Everytime he will go to a job interview he has to tell people that he is a convicted rapist and he must pay child support for the next 18 years. Also she lied about her age.

So this whole thing started with me posting ""Does it scare you that a woman can ruin a mans life with no evidence?"" 

In the post i went on to mention Johnny Depp and his current situation with him and his wife. Johnny depp got accused of being a wife beater by a news outlet called The Sun. Johnny filed for defamation and his wife started playing the victim card. She later admitted to throwing things like pots at his head. Depp still got punished even though there was LITERAL EVIDENCE of his wife beating him and his wife got away with it with no punishment. If that dosen't tell you that our law system is corrupt, i dont know what will.

The mods took the post down saying that it had a ""personal agenda"". I messaged the mods in a sort of ""Hey what the hell mods?"" kinda way. The mods started attacking me saying that i'm sexist and that they have lawyers on their mod team and that I know nothing of the law system. They later started saying stuff like ""Stop shitting on the carpet and go back to whatever MGTOW perpetual victimhood echo chamber you slithered out from"". They blocked me and temp banned me from the subreddit after they said that. Both from that last insult and defending the woman in court when theres literal evidence of the woman doing the crime you can tell that the mod that I argued with uses twitter.

I humbly request that you do not harass anyone involved with this.",1.0,1.0,1.0,39.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jrfs73/got_into_an_argument_with_the_raskwomen_mods_for/,Easiestcc

I'll call your uncles about this to have them lecture you, it's tradition!"" (She comes from a conservative Nigerian household)) Believe me, I'm open to forgiveness and I'd be a lot less angry if my mother had remorse. (I'm not even on speaking terms with my father.)

Unfortunately, as I saId, this isn't the only thing I reflect on (false rape accusations, lack of emotional support for men, biased family courts, and issues outside men's rights).

Someone on Facebook posted about this subreddit and i wandered onto here just curious. I think it‚Äôs important to stay curious about each other so we can have a meeting of the minds instead of judgement. Women do have a lot of oppression that is systemic, meaning it‚Äôs within the policies of our government, work places and judicial system and not just the general attitude of the people around us. That said, i also do think women have certain privileges that men don‚Äôt and vice versa. For example, women are statistically more likely to gain custody of their children than men. That‚Äôs just a fact and many states still have archaic rules regarding this. Men aren‚Äôt ‚Äúallowed‚Äù to express emotion which can lead to suppressed feelings and trauma, depression, and even violent behavior. I hope we can all realize the short comings of each gender and  in between and work towards a better future where we strive to understand each other and have empathy for the very valid concerns and emotions each has. Some of the comments i see on here can get pretty misogynistic, but i feel its important to understand where there is anger there is also pain. I‚Äôm glad you guys have a place to come to and vent to eachother because that is healthy but i hope you recognize the pain within each other and within the angry statements and i hope you know that many women out there who say we want an equal future, also mean equal for men where they can share this pain out in the open and are able to better heal and connect with those around them. I hope you guys find that in your lives someday, truly. We‚Äôre all out here trying our best. 

If a woman/girl in your life gets irritated or if you get irritated when hearing about feminism (whatever that means there‚Äôs so many different factions of it which don‚Äôt agree with each other whatsoever) just remember as humans, we are flawed and our initial reaction is to view a subject through our own lens of perception, bias, and inherent trauma. All our feelings are very real and they are very valid but remember some might be coming from a place of trauma, pain, or bias and may be skewed for that reason. That person irritated might be talking from a place of trauma, you getting angry and yelling might be talking from a place of trauma. It‚Äôs just good to be aware of. Idk this is some stuff that has helped me in all my relationships and has helped me have compassion even with people i disagree with, just wanted to share.

This is astounding to me. It makes me sick to my stomach because; instead of raising full awareness about these types of rape cases it *actively* misidentifies it and likely *infatuates* this type of rape to others who may view the material without fully understanding what it is.

But here, in Spain, where feminism has grown into a part of our state, our minds, our institutions, it has grown to be a direct obstacle thrown into equality. The moment they had enough power to stop fearing coming across as ""misandrist"" the mask was taken off.

Ever since modern day feminism started, men's rights have been getting disregarded and women are being sexist towards men. Men's rights are getting looked down upon and the men in society are getting unfairly punished for it. 

One example of sexism against men is that if a woman writes a man's name down for a child that isn't his, the man still has to pay child support. In the past few years, there has been a bias against men in divorce courts.

Another example is that in most divorce cases the woman gets 90% of belongings plus the children. 

Yet another example is that if a man gets accused of false rape, the man will have their lives ruined in most situations even if the woman doesn't have any evidence.

2020-11-11 22:36:21,"THE FIRST WORLD WAR - THE HOLOCAUST AGAINST MEN? Investigation, Part I","Was the decision to force men into attritional warfare in the First World War a deliberate mass cull by the ruling classes of able-bodied men, at the time when they threatened most to revolt against their governments? If not, what explains the extraordinary and continuous orders for men to die on the Western and Eastern Fronts?  If so, what does it say that after a century, these mass-genocidalists have had to answer to no one, and today's ruling classes know that they are free from any retribution if and when they attempt the same?

**-  THE MEANS  -**

There is an extremely crucial distinction between volunteers and conscripts. And that is certainly the case in the First and the Second World Wars. It is still the case today.If a man dies or suffers in a lethal situation that he has volunteered to be in, you can say he took a risk, and he took the consequences. It resembles suicide. Once in though, they can be forced to do basically anything by their commanding officers. Once you are in, you cannot get out. So of course there are grey areas.If, however, a man dies or suffers in a lethal situation that he has been *forced* into ‚Äì then that casualty ‚Äì or death - is not the same as for a volunteer. If it is a death: it is *Murder*. And the murderer is the government who knowingly forced that man into a life-threatening situation. This, is the case of Conscription.When we multiply that murder or grevious bodily harm by the number of these men ‚Äì conscripts ‚Äì who were forced against their will into the Killing Fields of the First and the Second World Wars, we have the greatest murder crime in history. It is the mass murder of millions of men. And further, when we see who were forced ‚Äì exclusively men ‚Äì it is now a Mass Genocide. On top of that, those of the lower classes were most at risk, and most numerous among conscripts. Essentially, the oppressed younger men that were threatening to destroy the ruling classes in Russia, Britain, France and Germany, were destroyed by the ruling classes in Russia, Britain, France and Germany.

**-  THE MOTIVE  -**

At the time of the First World War, there was growing dissent in the major countries involved by the male lower classes. A new class of urban factory workers who laboured under hazardous conditions emerged from the Industrial Revolution. Angry at those who kept them impoverished, and often seeking work, they started for the first time to conglomerate in the major cities, where they met other men who found common ground in their deprivation and anger at the ruling class. In 1909 Clemenceau's French government ordered troops to open fire on anarcho-syndicalist General Confederation of Labour strikers. His later President would be Poincar√©, who was seen, especially in the English-speaking world, as an aggressive figure who had helped to cause the war in 1914. One of the two main issues in the Spring of 1914 was maintaining the 3-year conscription of French males. The period from 1910 to 1914 was marked by labour unrest including strikes in Britain and Ireland. The British Socialist Party was founded in 1911. The Bolsheviks in Russia formed their own party in 1912, and the concept of class struggle was brought to a new level at that time, and was reported in the international press. Two years later, amid growing class tensions, Jean Jaures, a prominent socialist and anti-war leader in France who opposed the war-mad Emile Driant and his conscription law, was assassinated in July 1914. The First World War started, and the lower-class males who could threaten to revolt were sent to their deaths by the governments who were scared of that possibility.Sure enough, the same men who were targeted - those who survived and still had the use of their bodies - went on to revolt against their rulers, in both Russia and Germany, and to resist conscription in all other countries. The French revolted in the French Army mutinees of 1917. The WWI killing machine was the main cause of the Russian Revolution and the German Revolution. In Britain there was none, and that shows greatly in the Fascism of that country's governments and laws, and state propaganda, virtually ever since.When considered in this light, The Killing Fields fulfill all the criteria for Mass Genocide: 1. A targeted demographic section of the population 2. Millions of murders 3. A resultant population shortage (the 'Man Shortage') 4. Forcing the target demographic into the killing zone 5. A political interestCan we identify more specific patterns that might point to particular perpetrators? As it happens, yes. Those who pushed for the legislation that forced conscription on the male populace, for one. And of course, those giving the orders of battle. Today I address the top authorities on the field, and the most complicit of their leaders.

**-  THE OPPORTUNITY  -**

The following are the worst battles, by casualties, of the First World War. Except for three of them, and Cambrai with 95,000 casualties, all of the following battles inflicted casualties of over 100,000 men each. In some cases the count was three to four hundred thousand. In some over half a million, and in a few cases, a million or more casualties were suffered.

**SERBIAN CAMPAIGN 1914, THE FRONTIERS, TANNENBERG, GALICIA, THE MARNE, THE AISNE, YPRES I, LODZ, CHAMPAGNE I, SARIKAMISH, MASURIAN LAKES II, YPRES II, GALLIPOLI, ARTOIS II, CHAMPAGNE II AND ARTOIS III, GORLICE-TARNOW, THE GREAT RETREAT, SERBIAN CAMPAIGN 1915, ERZURUM, VERDUN, ASIAGO, BRUSILOV OFFENSIVE, THE SOMME, MONASTIR, ROMANIAN CAMPAIGN, NIVELLE OFFENSIVE, THE AISNE II,  ARRAS, MESSINES, THE ISONZO X, YPRES III, THE ISONZO XI, CAPORETTO, CAMBRAI, SPRING/LUDENDORFF OFFENSIVE (MICHAEL-YPRES IV-THE AISNE III-GNEISENAU), THE PIAVE II, THE MARNE II, THE HUNDRED DAYS OFFENSIVE.**

I wondered what we can learn from lessons given at such a price. 

My interest then was, who exactly was most responsible for these mass murders? We know that figures in the German, French, British and Russian governments were. Then it occured to me that, if the gigantic amount of casualties was simply because ‚Äúthat's war for you‚Äù, then there doesn't seem to be much reason for any pattern to emerge in these disasters.

Except that when I analysed them, just on two measures alone, that's not what I found.

The two measures were: 1. CASUALTY COUNT OVER 100,000 MEN 2. BATTLE COMMANDER/S

Of course, any battle with casualties ‚Äì especially such a high count as 30, 40 or 60,000, is a tragedy worth looking into. But I used a limit of roughly 100,000 casualties. I focused on four ruling regimes ‚Äì the British, the Russian, the German and the French heirarchies. As it happens, all of the highest-casualty battles of the First World War involved at least one of these regimes, as far as I can discern. The next step ‚Äì and admittedly the choice of this number was somewhat arbitrary ‚Äì was to find those battles in which one of these four nationalities lost a hundred thousand or more men ‚Äì just from that single country alone. And just to clarify ‚Äì yes, these are mindblowing numbers. Such was the lack of concern for the men on the front lines.One would think that repeatedly losing so many of ones own 'valuable heroes' would be strongly avoided. If a commander inflicted 100,000+ casualties on 'his own' men, surely he would be disciplined, and would hopefully never lead a major battle again.

I then looked into who, specifically, has been attributed leadership of these atrocities. Was there a particular officer of one of these four rulerships that commanded more than one battle where he was responsible for the deaths and injuries of 100,000+ of the men taking his orders?

I hope today, on the 11th day of the 11th month, on the 102nd anniversary of the cesassion of the violence, to start with one of the four core nations, and whether there were any patterns in who caused the most casualties, and if so, who they were and what they were about.

                                      FRANCE   

Continuing with this method, we will see if the French heirarchy had any odd reccurances of leaders responsible for repeated mass killings. If any are identified, we will look closer at their behaviour, and see if there is any correlation with their attitudes or behaviour towards their soldiers, the proletariat, the underclass, the bolsheviks, or other revolutionaries trying to fight the system.Note: The length of this report will be determined by my findings at the general rank level, for most cases. There may be many more suspects at the equivalent levels of brigadier, colonel, major, captain, and, indeed, lieutenant.

Battles with approx **100,000+** casualties under the French command - and the battle commanders: 

**FIRST BATTLE OF THE MARNE**: JOSEPH JOFFRE. JOSEPH GALLIENI. MICHAEL-JOSEPH MAUNOURY. LOUIS FRANCHET D'ESPEREY. FERDINAND FOCH. FERNAND DE LANGLE DE CARY. PHILLIPE PETAIN. MAURICE SARRAIL.

**THE BATTLE OF THE SOMME**: JOFFRE. FOCH. FAYOLLE. JOSEPH ALFRED MICHELER.

**PASSCHENDAELE ‚Äì THE THIRD BATTLE OF YPRES**: FRANCOIS ANTHOINE.

**THE SPRING OFFENSIVE**: FOCH. PETAIN.

**THE HUNDRED DAYS OFFENSIVE**: FOCH. PETAIN.

These are some figures that hold the key to whether conscription was used to instigate a class and gender mass genocide. In this case, in France. And, as it has not been recognised as such yet, to see if todays governments can get away with the same thing, with just as little consequence.

&amp;#x200B;

**-  THE SUSPECTS  -**

&amp;#x200B;

**CLEMENCEAU**

The only name not on the above list due to his 'civilian' status as political ruler.   It was Clemenceau's lobbying that pushed the issue of increasing conscription from two to three years in France. Clemenceau hated the cause of the lower classes. He reorganised the French police forces and ordered repressive policies towards the workers' movement. After a mine disaster that killed over a thousand miners, Clemenceau ordered the military against the strikers and repressed the wine-growers' strike too. He declared as the enemy of the French Section of the Workers International, led by Jean Jaures. Jaures was a threat to Clemenceau and his allies for his popularity with and ability to mobilise the lower classes, and his strong opposition to conscription of French males. Jaures position on the beseiged wine-growers was telling them ""In the vat of the Republic, prepare the wine of the Social Revolution!"" The government shot these striking protesters. Clemenceau's position on lethal violence against the male lower classes in his country was clear to see, for example when he ordered troops to open fire on anarcho-syndicalist General Confederation of Labour strikers. Jaures, however, took a mostly reconcilliatory approach, positioning himself as the mediator and rational uniter of different areas of ideology, and also, of different major countries. He was due to go to another international conference to diffuse the buildup to war, when, on July 31st 1914, he was assassinated. More or less as soon as he was out of the way, the next day the French government announced their mobilisation, and three days later, the First World War commenced. For militants like Clemenceau, although now out of government, the peacemaker was out of the way. As soon as the war started, Clemenceau advised the Interior Minister Malvy to arrest a list of known and suspected subversives. When he took control of the country again, in 1917, he instigated a crackdown on those who opposed him, citing that they were a threat to national security. His close and long-term sidekick and confidant was Ferdinand Foch (see later in text), whom he appointed to Generalissimo in 1918. Together they hated the proletariat and the socialists, whom both would try to oppress, even in Russia after the War ended. A year and four months into Clemenceau's second rule of France, the alleged assassin of Jaures was freed. Below are the French officers who lead the most men, largely lower-class and young, to their deaths.

**JOFFRE** 

Before the war broke out Joffre had already pushed to extend conscription from 2 to 3 years. He collaborated with the British mass-murdering generals, such as Kitchener and Haig. With another, Robertson, he resisted the allied plans to send more men to Salonika, and to send most of their conscripts to the Western Front. He repeatedly broke protocol by going directly to the British generals rather than his own war ministry. Joffre hated rotation systems that relieved men from the front lines, keeping them longer in hells such as Verdun. It was Joffre that appointed most of the other French mass-murderers on this list ‚Äì while dismissing many 'unsuccessful' divisional, corps and army commanders, it was he that put Foch, d'Esperey, Petain and Nivelle in charge of the battles when he didn't lead himself ‚Äì despite the latter two being more junior at the time. It was also he who ordered the executions of French conscripts who resisted his orders.

**MANGIN** 

Like Earl Haig, Charles Mangin got the nickname 'the Butcher'. One of the few high-ranking officials who actually supported Nivelle's massacres (more under 'Nivelle'). Unlike the other tyrants though, he was more interested in the cannonfodder being 'noire' when possible ‚Äì his book, 'La force noire' he was persistent in pushing for using men from places that France had colonised. This, with many opponents to it, did lead to the mass recruitment of males from countries in Africa. So war-minded was he though, that his book on using foreigners as troops was published already in 1910. Gave the orders with Joffre, De Cary, Petain, Nivelle, and others, at the catastrophic Battle of Verdun. So many men were killed and wounded under him that after the Battle of The Aisne was abandoned, Mangin was sacked. So was Nivelle, who had lead the overall assault. But the Clemenceau-Foch conspiracy had a use for such a killer of his men, so once Foch was promoted to Allied Supreme Commander, the two recalled Mangin. He ended up commanding the Tenth Army on the Western Front, enabling him to get another 95,165 Frenchmen killed or wounded at the Second Battle of The Marne, with Foch, Fayolle and others. Mangin's catchphrase illustrates his attitude towards the poor men he commanded: ""Quoi qu'on fasse, on perd beaucoup de monde"" (""Whatever you do, you lose a lot of men"").

**NIVELLE** 

Robert Nivelle knew how to kill men en mass, as an artillery general before the war. It is helpful to identify any of these mass-murderers experiences with lower-class men, to see how this influenced their eagerness to kill the same demographic under their command. Sure enough, Nivelle was involved with class struggle before the war, when he went to China to repress their Boxer Rebellion ‚Äì despite that France was not leading the offence. May 1916 ‚Äì succeeded Philippe Petain as commander of the French Second Army in the Battle of Verdun. Nivelle ordered men to their deaths under the guise of 'counter-attacks' which were completely pointless, to the extent that, by the 12th of June, only one fresh reserve brigade was left in the Second Army. The way that Nivelle sent men to their deaths even raised the eyebrow of Crown Prince Wilhelm, a mass-murderer himself (see Germany section). He described the overwhelming view of one battleground where ‚ÄúFrance's best regiments were being destroyed in continually renewed, hopeless attacks.‚Äù   Things got worse, as Nivelle was appointed commander in chief of the French armies in December 1916. This paved the way for the Nivelle Offensive. That Christmas Day, as Nivelle was sworn in, Great Britain brought in conscription. On the same day, all German boys and men from the age of 17 to 60 were called up. In the book World War 1: 1914-1918, the word given to the execution of Nivelle's mass slaughter was ‚Äúmurderous‚Äù. On April 16th 1917, Nivelle ordered more than one million men to leave their trenches and go over the top into No Man's Land. With that, if not before, the men were starting to realise what was going on. More than 100,000 French soldiers had been killed on wounded in the first week. Incredibly, Nivelle insisted on continuing the bloodshed, claiming that he expected a ‚Äúbreakthrough‚Äù at any moment. Even at the highest levels, many had told Nivelle to change his plans for the Offensive ‚Äì but he completely ignored every one of them, at every turn.   When it became obvious that the 'plan' had fallen into German hands, he forced the men on the front lines to continue. The men had finally had enough of being sent to their executions. They were reading and passing on French socialist and Bolshevist publications, telling men on the lines about the February Revolution. Russian conscripts in France were spreading the word about the growing class uprising in their country, encouraging French and Russian conscripts to join. In April to mid May, the Second Battle of the Aisne under Nivelle incurred between 187,000 and 300,000 French casualties. In early May, the 2nd Division refused to follow orders, and this spread into a movement that involved more than half of the divisions in the French Army. Tragically, while most of these were in the infantry, much fewer of their fellow conscripts in field artillery regiments at a safer distance joined them. Nonetheless, Nivelle was finally dismissed from that command. Unfortunately, the replacement was called Philippe Petain.

**PETAIN** 

What do Bernard Kerik, an American at the core of 9/11, and Phillipe Petain have in common? They are the only mass murderers in their respective campaigns who were actually imprisoned. And neither were jailed for their worst standalone crimes. You may have heard of Petain, as he was the Prime Minister of France in the Second World War ‚Äì installed by Hitler as the ruler of France under the Nazis. When the war ended, he was convicted of treason and given the death penalty. However, because he was the oldest French head of state, and because of his 'service' in the First World War, it was commuted to life imprisonment. Lets take a look at that 'service'. Along with Foch, Nivelle, Mangin, De Cary and Joffre, Petain was the worst mass-murderer of French conscripts. He played a part in leading over 100,000 French men to their deaths or harm in the First Battle of The Marne.   Along with Foch, he is the only French general to have forced over 300,000 Frenchmen to their deaths or to assault ‚Äì in his case, on three separate occasions. For this, he was called a 'national hero' ‚Äì and still has his apologists today. Instead of admitting responsibility for his mass murders, he said 'This is what happens when you're led by Socialists.' It may not be his colour, but he is caught red-handed when you consider the connection between his mass murders of lower-class men, and his hatred for that demographic. So a connection between the casualties he inflicted on his conscripts, and his class politics, is not hard to find. Vehemently anti-Bolshevik, Petain hated the left-leaning Third Republic government, and upon gaining national power under Hitler, shut down the trade union confederations, firstly the C.G.T. He hated communists, and those who allowed them 'intellectual responsibility'. Previously, as Minister for War he repeatedly called for a lengthening of the term for compulsory military slavery (conscription) from two to three years. So much did he despise the lower classes that he was offended when his fascist movement was called a 'revolution'. His new France would be, he said, ‚Äúa social heirarchy...rejecting the false idea of the natural equality of men‚Äù. Which begs the question: How accidental can his killing and wounding of over a Million lower-class Frenchmen be?? Petain was also the one in charge of the executions of French conscripts who didnt follow orders. So fascist was he in fact, that he actually changed the republican motto 'Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©"" (""Freedom, Equality, Brotherhood"") to ""Travail, famille, patrie"" (""Work, family, fatherland""). It should come as no surprise, then, that the British rulership, the American president, General Franco, and others campaigned with repeated French governments for his release. Like the other fascist mass killers on this list, to this day, he has sympathisers and admirers who take care of his Wikipedia page, and protest the removal of street names in his honour in the US, Canada and China, a mountain and geological features in Canada, and his Canyon of Heroes ribbon on Broadway in New York. If poor male conscripts were Jews, eh. (PS. On the subject of New York, Jews, and no justice for evil crimes, you'll find the truth of 9/11 very interesting.)

**FOCH** 

Foch was Clemenceau's closest conspirator, through which French politics was most directly enacted on the battlefield. Foch and 'Putain' were the only French leaders to ‚Äì repeatedly - force over 300,000 Frenchmen at a time to their deaths or assault. On a single occasion, the only top French commander of a battle to do that in one go was Francois Antoine. Here is Foch on the marshes at St. Gond, proudly declaring his strategy: ‚ÄúMy centre is yielding. My right is retreating. Situation excellent. I am attacking.‚Äù This 'strategy' was actually the doctrine taught in his books to French commanders. His reputation worsened when these books were cited in the development of the disastrous offensive that brought France close to ruin in August 1914.   Heavy casualties and, on the surface, a complete lack of tactical awareness that caused Allied armies to suffer brought him strong criticism. It took Joffre removing him - probably to save himself, which failed as he was sacked days later - for his atrocities on the Western Front to cease. Unfortunately by then, December 1916, it was far too late. One of the most effective conscript-killers of the war, he certainly does seem to hate the class/demography of his slaves ‚Äì perhaps even more than Petain.   Foch led the massive loss of life at the First Battle of The Marne, with Joffre, D'Esperey, De Cary, Petain and a couple of others. With Joffre again, he led the French into the First Battle of Ypres. he also lead the average Frenchman to his unnecessary death in The Battle of The Somme, again with Joffre and Fayolle (as well as Joseph Alfred Micheler). And He led the Second Battle of The Marne with other failures including Marie Emile Fayolle and Charles Mangin. The total casualties of the French from these is estimated at between 595,165 to over 630,000 men. It seems though that Foch wanted to get his Million. It wouldn't be a stretch of the mind to think there was a very dark, sadistic competition between these officers. Not only The Spring Offensive, but also The Hundred Days Offensive, were lead by the same two commanders: Foch and Petain. The Spring Offensive caused around 433,000 casualties ‚Äì for France alone. You would think that the same pair of leaders wouldn't be put in charge together again. But the French government seemed to approve of the suffering and murder of so many lower-class men and boys. So in the Hundred Days Offensive, the French Government let Foch and Petain get 531,000 more French males killed or injured.   While Foch is responsible for many more French deaths under his command, his total from those mentioned here seems to be between 1,559,200 and 1,594,000 casualties. Of 'his own' men. Its hard to imagine that anyone could kill more of their men if they were trying to. That point becomes more than sinister when you learn that Foch, like Petain, and other commanders ‚Äì both in France and in Britain, Russia and Germany ‚Äì would have had a motive to try. We saw that Petain had no problem surrendering to the Germans, because that's exactly what he did in the Second World War, for his own powergrab. Defending France's autonomy was clearly not his motive. What motives did his partner in mass murder have, to kill almost as many lower-class men as he did? Not content with killing French civilians, after the First World War ended, Ferdinand Foch jumped at the chance when his expertise in killing the proletariat was requested by the Poles. The enemy? The lower-class male Bolsheviks of revolutionary Russia.   Clemenceau sent Foch to work with a Polish counter-revolutionary, Josef Pilsudski, to crush the proletariat revolution in Russia. ‚ÄúFoch‚Äôs plan involved a coordinated offensive against the Bolsheviks with a multi-national army. The intervention forces would be supplied by the allies and of course under the overall command of Marshal Foch himself.‚Äù Foch's commander then, Clemenceau, hated the bolsheviks to the point where he refused them access to the peace talks, threatening to resign. ‚ÄúIf the Bolsheviks would have sent their delegates to Paris‚Äù, he said, ‚Äúthe extremists would have been encouraged, and then the middle classes would have panicked.‚Äù This class-consciousness is surely something Clemenceau and Foch had in common. ‚ÄúMarshal Foch tried to devise all sorts of plans to attack in Russia against the Bolsheviks by using armies made up of Poles, Finns, Czechs, Slovaks, Romanians, and even Russian prisoners of war still in Germany, but nothing materialized...‚Äù This wasn't that surprising, as by this stage he was exposing himself as the obsessive maniac that he was ‚Äì even the French weren't behind him, the soldiers he was assembling thought it too dangerous...even the British and the Americans refused to get involved in the scheme.   Foch said he feared a Germany-Russia alliance. One of the only other delegates to think that was remotely possible was Winston Churchill. So now Foch had a go at leading the killing of British men too. He said it was urgent to conscript British men after WWI, and send them to Russia, to stop ‚Äúthe advance of Bolshevism before it penetrated Austria and Germany‚Äù. Churchill supported Foch's appeal, but, fortunately, others in Britain didn't. It was ‚Äúimmensely unpopular‚Äù, according to Sir Henry Wilson. And this immense unpopularity should have suffocated Foch everywhere he went. It seems that Foch's ideals were clear:

**1. MOTIVE: 'We need to crush the Proletariat'.** 

**2. MEANS: 'Set up Conscription so I can drag all the Proletariat threat in under my command'.** 

**3. OPPORTUNITY: 'Kill the Proletariat, by using my authority to send them into a death zone'.**

It turns out that the Three year conscription law of 1913, pushed in parlaiment by Clemenceau, had been co-authored by Tardieu and none other than Ferdinand Foch himself. It had originally been proposed by Premier Briand ‚Äì before any outbreak of the World War, not in reaction to it. Briand is also a figure of interest, as he attended a meeting on Poncaire's train about the upcoming Anglo-French offensive on The Somme ‚Äì which we know resulted in one of the greatest losses of men in British, French and German history. The others present were Foch ‚Äì then commander of Army Group North ‚Äì and the worst of the British man-killers, Earl Haig. In this train carriage were perhaps the worst battle-commanding killers of their own citizens in history. It would have been interesting to overhear their conversation on that train carriage on May 31st 1916. According to International Abolition of Conscription', the most vociferous about maintaining an excuse to have a French conscript army after the First World War was also Ferdinand Foch. In fact, something that concerns many of us outside France, it was largely Foch who prevented the adoption of agreements for the international abolition of conscription. Read that again. That, by consequence, might elevate Ferdinand Foch to the status of the worst mass-murderer in recorded History. Not least considering what would follow two decades later. In his mangled brain, it was the belief that the Treaty of Versailles was actually too lenient on the Germans, that prompted him to say of it, as Supreme Allied Commander: ""This is not peace. It is an armistice for twenty years."" Foch had proven his level of evil to the other powers. Britain consequently made him a Field Marshal ‚Äì the rank that commands the entire British Army, in 1919.

&amp;#x200B;

And what of Great Britain's rulers? Were they just in it to win a war? Or did they have a proletariat-killing heirarchy of their own?

I hope to continue this series by questioning next the willful British, German and Russian annihilation of their male lower classes - by addressing such mass genocidalists as Earl Haig and Lord Kitchener of Britain, Ludendorff of Germany, and Brusilov of Russia.

**CONCLUSION**

With the Means, the Motive, and the Opportunity, there are definite Suspects that stand out on the basis of the ‚Äì otherwise inexplicable - number of potential revolutionaries with Bolshevic-like motivations, that they forced to death and disability.

At the time when the underclass and working-class young men of Russia, Britain, Germany and France were threatening to rise up against their establishment oppressors, the willingness to force these very same men into the Killing Fields, to suffer such unbelievable casualties, is an issue where *assuming good intentions just isn't good enough*. 

If it happened then, and still even today they have not been held to account, then it can happen today with the same result. Conscription is never acceptable, it can easily be used as a weapon for class and gender genocide, and it is our job to fight it, for all men and boys of the present and the future.

2020-11-12 07:15:52,Could someone help me fact check my essay on the discrimination of men in the justice system?,"so first I wanna thank the awesome people who gave me sources for my essay on my last post. You guys are awesome.

Here is the progress I have made on my essay:

&amp;#x200B;

 

In the past few years, there has been a bias against men in courts. Ever since modern day feminism started, men's rights have been getting disregarded and women are being sexist towards men. Men's rights are getting looked down upon and the men in society are getting unfairly punished for it. This has led to men being discriminated against in the justice system.Ever since modern day feminism started, men's rights have been disregarded and women are being sexist towards men. Men's rights are getting looked down upon and the men in society are getting unfairly punished for it. This has led to men being discriminated against in the justice system.

One example of sexism against men is that if a woman writes a man's name down for a child that isn't his, the man still has to pay child support. There was a good example of this in 2017 where a man was forced to pay $65,000 dollars in child support when his wife cheated on him and got pregnant with another man without his knowledge. Another good example is in 2015 when a man was a wanted man because he refused to pay child support for a child that wasn't his. Men shouldn't be unfairly punished just because a woman decided to screw them over by writing their name on the paper. There should be a law that makes it to where scientists have to DNA test the baby to see if the names match up. If the names do not match up, the woman is fined a minimum of $10,000 dollars.

Another example is that in most divorce cases the woman gets 90% of belongings plus the children. Some would draw the conclusion that it is because women or more capable to take care of children. What about the cases where the man wants to divorce because the woman is a bad person? There are some women who will marry a person, have a child with them, and then proceed to divorce them to both mentally destroy the man and screw him over financially because divorcing is a very long and expensive process. There is also the factor of the crimes that either side has committed in the past. Speaking of crimes...

Yet another example is that if a man gets accused of false rape, the man will have their lives ruined in most situations even if the woman dosen't have any evidence. This is because women are 39% less likely to be incarcerated, and when they *are* incarcerated their sentences are 23% shorter compared to men. Men receive longer sentences compared to women. People should get equal sentences no matter the crime. In general, Women are less likely to be punished in the justice system. Even if a woman is punished, they usually get shorter sentences. This creates a narrative that insinuates that women can't do anything wrong and that if someone does anything wrong, it's usually the man's fault.

Feminisim has 0 credibility, here's why","Feminisim claiming that they care for every women is a lie and their treatment of islam shows exactly that, they claim to care about women's equality and that women in the west are oppressed dispite feminisim being unable to name a single right men have that they don't. They do this while completely ignoring the auful and legitimate oppression of women in the middle east, in islam.

 Because pretty much everything feminists claim is happening to women over here is ACTUALLY happening over there, and feminists willfully ignoring it completely kills feminisims credibility of actually caring about the women they claim to help, but they don't care. Their claim of being for women's equality and stopping women oppression, but ignoring where that is actually happening to cover up a religions pure idiology, is a disgrace to women. The second that women realize what feminisim is doing with islam of willfully ignoring the actual oppression of women thanks to Islam's pure ideological culture around women, which in legitimate terms is an actual rape culture.

Why? Because raping women in islamic culture is taught and celebrated by islam, I absolutely dispise of the men in islam who commit atrocities to women in that culture but I dispise feminisim even more for willfully ignoring it. Feminisim has no credibility because they are trying to defend and cover up a culture and religion that commits the very atrocities feminisim claims to fighting against, why does feminisim do this?, They do it to uphold the naritive of female oppression in the west.

Thats it all done.
Rationale
From highschool you like a girl
You focus on her she tells u, u cant talk to other girls why are you always with your friends you get a peice of p sleeve and she offers you nothing besides that and btw you pay for everything.
College if she gets pregnant you are begging her not to have a baby and its not your choice from this point many men have already lost
Marriage dead boring bedrooms, in laws and you work double shifts to provide while she stays at home and the house is not cleaned. Then you are begging for her to stay cause if she leaves thats alimony and child support
As Coach Greg Adams states its the hope stragety women have the advantage. So its best not to play
Even if you get a vastectomy and piss off a woman and she yells grape thats like 10k in legal fees.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jt02pg/how_to_get_our_rights_back/,stanparrable

2020-11-13 06:03:46,Hot take: Slut shaming is proof that men are viewed as less valuable,"The point is simple to understand. Men being praised and women being shamed comes from a simple fact - women are considered higher value.

When you are chosen by several perceived higher value beings your feat is viewed as impressive and when you go out with perceived lesser valued beings your behavior is treated as degrading.

The shitty joke about the key and the lock is spot on.

Because women are supposed to ""choose"" in society them being chosen is degrading, and men being chosen by a lot of the choosers is truly an impressive feat.

2020-11-13 08:55:45,The Vice Presidency is being handed to Kamala Harris for being a woman,"Gender discrimination **of any kind** is wrong, full stop.  So let's just call a spade a spade and admit that ""committing to a female running mate"" means the same thing as refusing to consider any men, solely on the basis of their gender.  Before the Democratic primary was even over, various organizations were already attempting to [bully](https://archive.is/8EFCr) the eventual winner into refusing to consider any men in their choice of running mate.  Within only a few days, Joe Biden appeased this anti-male hate mob by unequivocally [submitting](http://archive.is/b6cPI) to their horrific demand to refuse to consider any men when selecting his running mate.  During the Vice Presidential [debate](https://www.youtube.com/embed/t_G0ia3JOVs?start=1995&amp;end=2040) (from timestamp 33:15 to 34:00 in the video), Kamala Harris smugly rubbed into the faces of everyone watching that she indeed felt that merely being female should seriously be considered one of her qualifications for being selected for higher office.  Then, after the election, she gave a Vice Presidential acceptance speech in which she gushed continuously about women and thanked Joe Biden for choosing her on the basis of her [gender](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iu7AbNaKFqc?start=126&amp;end=150) (from timestamp 2:06 to 2:30 in the video).

Not only is all of this explicitly anti-male, but also, imagine what kind of message feminists would be sending if Biden ends up no longer being able to fulfill the Presidential role and Harris takes over...  Feminists are so obsessed with proving that women can do anything that men can do, but then for some reason they seem to think that the only way a woman can ever stand a chance at becoming President is if someone is given such an obvious leg up in order to help her get there.  Is there any reason we should have any respect for this ""achievement"" that Harris did nothing to earn?",1.0,1.0,1.0,35.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jt7bod/the_vice_presidency_is_being_handed_to_kamala/,DignifiedAlpaca

Yes there are topics men have it not as good as women have, science proved it, also.

But they did it with ducking undeniable facts / statistical evidence. With representative samples. They published it in peer reviewed journals, so experts looked over it and some even calculated everything again just to test it. This is a hell lot of work doing so.

2020-11-14 05:12:52,Woman here to ask some questions in peace,"First off just saying again that I come in PEACE I just genuinely want to ask some questions and start a conversation with some people. I just stumbled to to this subreddit and wanted to ask your opinions...

So first I‚Äôll say that I agree with MOST things from both feminist and men‚Äôs rights ideologies. I think men as victims in sexual assault/domestic abuse isn‚Äôt talked about enough. I think the high male suicide rate isn‚Äôt talked about enough, and I think that our society denies men from having feelings and being a human being by saying to ‚Äúbe a man‚Äù and ‚Äúgrow a pair‚Äù, which in the long run I think is mentally damaging. 

However I also think that women are systematically discouraged from pursuing their careers compared to their male colleagues (because women are traditionally home makers). On the other hand I also think that our society doesn‚Äôt place as much value on traditionally ‚Äòfeminine‚Äô work - caretaking, raising a family, teaching, etc. There have also been decades of policy trying to take away women‚Äôs access to birth control and abortion - which stops a woman from making personal medical choices.

I see people on both sides who are extreme. Feminists who hate men and men‚Äôs rights people who hate women. But for the most part I agree with the majority of what both sides are saying. So I guess my question is: What specifically do you have against feminism? Is it an institutional issue or do you actually disagree with the ideas behind it? And second, why can‚Äôt the logical and well meaning people from both ‚Äúsides‚Äù come together and work towards a society that is more equal for both genders?

I've heard legitimate criticism of our sub being filled with hate material against a certain gender. 
We must know that the news we consume affect our perception of people. 

The news articles listed here tend to be very 'anti-women' and to achieve our goal of political reform we need to change this sub to reduce the amount of articles highlighting the inequality and increase the posts on ways to combat it and change the system. 

Holding more protests and making our movement as strong as the feminist movement should be our end goal. 

Posting more legitimate actionable reforms like 'financial abortion's by Hales and advertising it should be our end goal.

 Please consider not allowing as much 'hate' against society for giving women an advantage in certain cases. 

Let's make this movement about reform and not just forgetting about something after seeing  a post about it and fostering hate for a group in our minds.

2020-11-14 22:17:41,Addressing homicide by men against men,"Suicide is often talked about on this sub as an unsupported men‚Äôs issue. But homicide is also an act which affects men at a much higher rate than women. Men are more likely to commit homicide and die as a result of homicide.

As the Bureau of Justice Statistics puts it: 

‚ÄúAlthough the killing of women, or ‚Äúfemicide‚Äù as it is often called, tends to receive intense media coverage (Pritchard and Hughes 1997), men are far more likely to be both perpetrators and victims of homicide. Over the past four decades, nearly three-fourths of all homicides have exclusively involved men. About 90% of all perpetrators are men, and ‚àº81% of their victims are men. Moreover, 78% of the victims of female offenders are also men. Stated in terms of rates per 100,000 population, men commit murder ‚àº10 times as often as women, and are victims nearly 4 times as often.‚Äù

Feminist theory puts this down to ‚Äòtoxic masculinity‚Äô and gender roles, essentially placing the blame on men. I‚Äôd be keen to know what you guys think this is caused homicide to affect men so much more frequently (ie. biological vs cultural), whether this is something we could or should aspire to change and if so, by what approach.",1.0,1.0,1.0,57.0,/r/MensRights/comments/ju2lat/addressing_homicide_by_men_against_men/,madtayham

Sure it‚Äôs easy to find these radical articles online from crazy bitter women, but how many women have you guys actually met in real life that are crazy radical feminists? Most women have common sense and reject the radical views and disagree with male oppression.

2020-11-15 16:08:32,How to make change.,"Whenever I look at the top posts here, the majority of them are always examples in the real world of men drawing the short straw or overcome the bias they are faced with. However are we still in the exploration phase, isn't it already proven that all these issues are real? I can give you statistical and argumentative evidence that men in first world countries are on average significantly less happy, live less fulfilling lives and face problems like an empathy gap or significantly lack of acceptance in any other role than the disposable, valueless male. 

So why are we still focusing so much on evidence, wouldn't it be better on focusing on way to deal with these problems with the means we have? E.g. guidelines to give young men which give them compromises between still experiencing a meaningful relationship with a woman and not getting exploited/ruined or forced into the typical male roles. Or therapeutic ways to deal with hate, discrimination and lack of empathy towards one. 

**Currently we are not on a path that will bring change**, we are **stuck** in this 'evidence' phase, since it is easier and in the short run more emotionally fruitful to outrage about perceived injustice instead of trying to understand how that injustice came to be and finding ways one can contribute to change that injustice. When I look at these 'example' posts I see comments that emotionally outrage how 'bad' and 'evil' the unjust party is, instead of analysing and trying to understand the system that lead to this situation, in order to find ways to prevent it, in order to bring **change and progress**. I can very safely predict that if I would look at this subreddit in 10 years, we would still be at the same spot we are today, crying about how bad the system is, without actually trying to see the big picture and find change.",1.0,1.0,1.0,10.0,/r/MensRights/comments/juijzm/how_to_make_change/,jukutt

A tiny woman is still capable of abusing a macho, muscular man.

I find it really upsetting to see people invalidate male experiences like that- it‚Äôs almost heartbreaking to see- I‚Äôve never experienced anything like that yet I still have passionate views about it so I can only imagine how the men who have been abused or raped by women feel when they see comments like that about how men don‚Äôt have to worry about it.

2020-11-16 04:47:26,Just had an idea,"Alright so about a week ago I made a post describing my negative experiences with women and how they are often times bullies, and its easy to get away with it when a man is on the receiving end due to societal barriers keeping them safe. And I also mentioned that I have noticed on countless occasions women helping one another out, often at a mans expense. Simple because women tend to ""stick together"" as long as there is no personal attachment to the guy in question, but if its a random guy neither of them know they will often treat him as disposable if it suits their needs. Anyways, I have heard time and time again women saying that they are oppressed, and I even asked in another group that had over ten thousand people how women are oppressed because I truly wanted to understand. Not a single girl responded. And its not because they didn't see the post, it was trending in that group they simply chose to ignore the question. But surely there must be some reason for why women are so bitter towards men.. surely there must be something to this so called opression. The best I could come up with is that due to men naturally being the stronger gender, we had advantages, especially back in the day when the world was more male dominated and women leaders were scarce/non existent. And overtime, the majority of our leadsrship is still men, as far as government is concerned that is. And somehow or another women associate this fact with them being opressed, and that is their excuse to believe that men as a whole are the enemy. Even us normal guys that aren't in positions of power, that choose to live normal lives with regular jobs. We all have to experience the brunt of the man hatred because of a very small percentage of men at the top that run things? 

This was the best thing I could logically come up with, because in the United States of America, women are far from opressed, women in the US are the most privileged in the world and it has turned them into spoiled brats. In fact I think men are the ones that are opressed in many cases, particularly when it comes to women accusing a man of something or a woman bullying a guy, its very hard to fight back or get nasty in return because we all know women can flip a switch in a second and play the victim card the moment a guy decides to stop tolerating their disrespectful b.s. and then the guy becomes the villain. (I lost a job because of a situation like this)

I'd like to hear your thoughts. Why do women think they are opressed? Why do they work together so much especially to help each other out at mans expense? And why do they think that all men are guilty because of a few men at the top? (If thats even the reason) . 

And I know there are women in here reading this.. please tell me your perapective of why you believe your gender acts this way.",1.0,5.0,0.78,32.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jut6sp/just_had_an_idea/,Salingo

***""Wikipedia seems to think so:***

***Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender. Sexism can affect anyone, but it primarily affects women and girls.""***

[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism)

*""Thinking further on refuges.¬† ¬†Women's refuges aren't for fleeing a man who was verbally or emotionally abusive.¬† They are for women who are*¬†*running for their lives*.¬† ¬† Yes, there are certainly men who leave a verbally or emotionally abusive woman.....but how many men are frightened that she'll get murdery?""

***""Where I live, we have homeless shelters just for women, women with children, and then co-ed. None just for men, despite the homeless population here being mostly men. A homeless woman will be taken in immediately but a man might have to wait, and then the help he receives will be cut off eventually.***¬†

***I delivered the rape story deadpan, the same way I deliver pretty much everything. It's kinda my thing. I do it without realizing and my ex wife used to hate that my face was almost always blank when we talked about serious issues. No, they didn't tell me I shouldn't have gotten drunk or that I should have been ore careful, they just laughed. To be fair, I think I should not have gotten so drunk or invited her to crash at my place, even if no one else said it.***¬†

***I'm not saying it's purposeful sexism that breast cancer gets more promotion, more money for research, and more attention. I just think that people in general care more about women's issues than men's. I'm just as guilty of it as the next person. I would put myself through some serious hardship without batting an eye if it would save my GF from having to deal with it. A lot of men here would do the same thing for their wives and GF's. Is it sexism?***¬†

***I think that men do have some grievances in some areas, mostly when it comes to family and divorce court. The rest....maybe not so much.""***

*""I believe that the society we live in now has an extremely unhealthy cultural attitude towards sex and gender and it's perfectly logical to me that everyone loses out because of this. Women, without a doubt, experience sexism. Other genders also experience sexism. Men absolutely experience it too. Being a feminist is absolutely about advocating for women's rights in the hopes they become equal with men, but we cannot and must not look over the importance that feminism carries for men too. We must all be liberated mainly from¬†expectations.*¬†

*A lot of women who have been severely hurt by men and who have been through trauma from men, including myself, go down the ""men are trash"" twitter rabbit hole sometimes. I think it's a pendulum effect from one extreme to the other. They explain that it's because ""good men will realise it's not about them"" and whilst I agree, I think men's issues will never be solved whilst we're still at the peak height of that swing. I went through a phase of being extremely frightened of men, mistrusting of men and sometimes I still am, because trauma isn't magically erased after counselling and treatment. However, I recognise now all of the hurt that men experience as a result of sexism. Men experience body shaming. Men are targeted with a whole host of expectations like being a provider, being strong, being able to control emotions, not crying, not appearing in any way to deviate from masculinity. Men are good people who are also being crushed by the system. It's time we stop comparing our harms and focus on the issues as individual and valid problems. Men's Rights Activists need to stop focusing on condemning feminism, intersectional feminists are already trying dismantle white, middle-class feminism.*

*Men's Rights Activists and Feminists need to work together on liberating men from high risk of suicide, liberating men from the stereotype of the absent, cold father, liberating men from only being able to express anger instead of sadness and vulnerability, and liberating men from dysfunctional or abusive relationships because they are not being supported in their childhood or in their adulthood from the trauma they experience and the misinformation they receive.""*",1.0,6.0,0.8,50.0,/r/MensRights/comments/juz7eb/whats_your_opinions_on_the_stuff_that_these/,AncientBodybuilder
2020-11-16 10:58:30,How could one argue patriarchy is a thing while ignoring gynocentrism went as far as ancient times?,"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator#Women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator#Women)

Take this for example

&gt;Roman morality required that all gladiators be of the lowest social classes, and emperors who failed to respect this distinction earned the scorn of posterity. [Cassius Dio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassius_Dio) takes pains to point out that when the much admired emperor [Titus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus) used female gladiators, they were of acceptably low class.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some regarded female gladiators of any type or class as a symptom of corrupted Roman appetites, morals and womanhood. Probably as a result, he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 AD.

Doesn't this mentality look familiar to you? Say modern morality?

Its completely moral for female spectator sitting in the comfort of auditorium and watch male slaughtering each other, but its immoral if reversed

Women never needed a movement for their privilege in the first place, gynocentrism and the disposability of male went as far as when societies and civilizations begun.

Not to mention general labory, slavery, warfare in ancient times were mostly all bond to the sacrifice of male, female mostly had the best protection and comfort it could have at the time. If anything its the lack of technology that contribute to the low quality of life women have back in time instead of social problem, put it simple: if the time is bad for women, then its even worse for men.

If you are a male slave in ancient time, compare to a female slave, who do you think would have a better chance of surviving? When feminists points out patriarchy, they ignore all the other factor that comes into play, comparing low class female to high class male is a gimmick they use all the time.

The funny thing is, from every source, let it be books, movies, tvs, games, when people point out the example of patriarchy, i see gynocentrism. There really are two sides to everything afterall. The entire foundation of feminism is built on the belief of predominance of the patriarchy, but that is just one-sided view, without addressing view-point from both angle, there will never be equality.",1.0,30.0,0.82,46.0,/r/MensRights/comments/juz7yn/how_could_one_argue_patriarchy_is_a_thing_while/,Starforce2005

I remember, even as a naive and slow-developing kid growing up in the 80's. I used to ask naive questions... why do boys and girls have to use different bathrooms? why do boys and girls cant share beds? Why can't boys go to girls sleepovers and vice versa?

The answer was always the same... ""Because some boys do bad things.""

So because some boys do bad things, my entire life has to be dictated and lived differently? I have to be personally isolated from the only people in my life back then because ""some men do bad things""? How does that make any sense?

And this gets carried on into adulthood. Men can't stay in family homeless shelters, they have to be kept in their own disgusting overcrowded pens. They can't go to certain schools, because they're only for women. They can't go to certain gyms, parties, groups,hangouts, etc etc...

3 women filed complaints with Stanford‚Äôs Title IX Office against the same student. He faced no repercussions

By Kate Selig on November 12, 2020

&amp;#x200B;

This story contains references to sexual misconduct and assault that may be troubling to some readers. The names of the students have been changed out of respect for the students‚Äô privacy.  The responding student did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including an email containing all the allegations made against him.

&amp;#x200B;

Three students reported allegations of misconduct and assault against the same student to the Title IX Office in early 2020. And after the office shut down the three students‚Äô cases, the case was sent to the admissions office, where Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw concluded ‚Äî based on a report from Title IX investigators ‚Äî that the responding student had not violated the Fundamental Standard.

&amp;#x200B;

The ultimate rejection and winding nature of the cases‚Äô trajectory exemplify difficulties students face in pursuing sexual violence cases, according to students and faculty. Advocates said that the students‚Äô experience also illustrates the difficulty of pursuing cases that take place before matriculation, as some of the alleged conduct took place prior to enrollment.

&amp;#x200B;

Cases of sexual misconduct that involve students who have been admitted to but have not yet enrolled at Stanford are handled by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Such cases are not subject to University policy or Title IX‚Äôs jurisdiction and are instead based on the requirement that applicants and prospective students act in accord with the Fundamental Stanford under a preponderance of evidence standard, according to University spokesperson Dee Mostofi.

&amp;#x200B;

Mostofi wrote that the staff of the Title IX Office, who addressed the students‚Äô initial reports and aided Shaw‚Äôs investigation, care deeply about these issues and continue to support a safe and respectful environment.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúThe Title IX Office provides support for students to ensure a fair, timely and effective Title IX process for conduct that falls within its jurisdiction,‚Äù Mostofi wrote. ‚ÄúThis fair and impartial process is essential for conflicting perspectives, which can lead to difficult outcomes for some parties.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

An external philanthropic organization that some of the reporting parties and the responding student were involved in conducted a separate investigation into the issue and found that allegations against the responding student could not be sustained, according to Mostofi, although the organization declined to comment on how the determination was reached and what standard was used.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Clara first met the responding student at a summer program unaffiliated with Stanford before their senior year of high school. ‚ÄúWe referred to each other as family, because that was what the program was premised on,‚Äù Clara said. But during a walk back to the responding student‚Äôs dorm, Clara said he touched her inappropriately, claiming he was drunk and high, only walking those claims back after Clara asked him to stop.

&amp;#x200B;

Symere met the responding student at the same summer program, crossing paths with him again after their acceptance to Stanford. In an off-campus location with 15 other people, Symere said she was tired, and lay down on one of the room‚Äôs beds. She said the responding student offered to let her put her head in his lap: ‚ÄúWe called each other family,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI thought it was out of goodwill.‚Äù

According to Title IX documentation Symere provided to The Daily, Symere told the office the responding student soon started touching her hair and arms. She asked the responding student to stop, and pulled her hands away from him, though he continued. Later that night, she said, the two fell asleep on the same bed.

&amp;#x200B;

She told the office she awoke to the responding student thrusting his erect penis against her lower back, later pinning her right arm so that she couldn‚Äôt move, while inappropriately touching her. Throughout, he told her he had never had sex before. Symere said she said ‚ÄúNo, stop,‚Äù multiple times, while tucking in her clothing and attempting to pull away. Symere said the responding student didn‚Äôt stop, continuing to inappropriately grope her while asking for sex. 

&amp;#x200B;

Symere eventually managed to grab her friend‚Äôs phone, setting an alarm to wake everyone up. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene, but I wanted him to stop,‚Äù she told The Daily. When the alarm went off, she said the people in the room woke up, allowing her to leave. 

Njuzi first met the responding during a Stanford program the summer before matriculation, where Clara and Symere warned her separately to stay away from him. Once the school year started, the two were placed in the same dorm. She said the responding student asked her to watch a movie with him, as the two were in a tight-knit friend group.  

&amp;#x200B;

At lunch, she said the responding student had denounced a rumored assault at a party. ‚ÄúHe said, ‚ÄòOh my god, that‚Äôs so disgusting,‚Äô‚Äù Njuzi said. ‚ÄúI thought he seems like he hates that, he would never do that.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

But as the two watched the movie, Njuzi said the responding student started to bombard her with compliments, asking if she was in a relationship and saying that he had never had his first kiss. She said he pressured her for a kiss for 20 minutes, while she told him that she did not want to hurt their friend group, politely trying to tell him no.

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually she gave in: ‚ÄúI started getting scared,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI realized I didn‚Äôt really know who he really was, and there wasn‚Äôt anyone in our dorm.‚Äù The situation escalated from a kiss without consent, Njuzi said, with the responding student groping her body, ‚Äúdry humping‚Äù her and moaning, while she laid there unmoving.

Afterward, she went to the library.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúI stared at the wall for a couple of hours,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI convinced myself mentally that I liked him, and he wouldn‚Äôt have done it if he didn‚Äôt care about me.‚Äù The two then were ‚Äúa thing‚Äù for two weeks before she broke the relationship off.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

Title IX contacted Clara in November of her freshman year, setting up a meeting where she said she was told the Title IX Office, based on a report from a community member, had reason to believe that she was a harmful influence on the community for spreading rumors about the responding student. Clara said she told the office that she had only told others about her own experiences when she felt intervention was necessary, like when the responding student started to prey on other women.

&amp;#x200B;

Mostofi declined to confirm the details of the meeting.

&amp;#x200B;

Clara, Symere and Njuzi, who had gotten in contact with each other through their shared experiences with the responding student, then decided to open preliminary inquiries into their cases with Title IX after consulting with each other.

Clara‚Äôs case was ‚Äútossed out pretty fast,‚Äù she said. Title IX emailed her to write that as her case had taken place prior to her and the responding student‚Äôs enrollment, it was outside of Title IX‚Äôs jurisdiction, according to documentation provided to The Daily. She decided not to pursue the case further, as she thought that serving as a witness to Symere and Njuzi‚Äôs cases would lead her to have a bigger impact.

&amp;#x200B;

At the time of the investigation, the scope of Title IX included alleged wrongdoing that impacted someone affiliated with the institution, regardless of the status of the respondent or geographic location. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos‚Äôs August regulations have since limited the jurisdiction of Title IX only to activity that takes place at a school or at a school-related event.

&amp;#x200B;

Symere said that as her experience with the student happened before matriculation, Title IX said the University was not responsible for the student‚Äôs actions.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúI found that insulting,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThey questioned me at least five, maybe seven times, about every little detail. None of them did anything.‚Äù 

&amp;#x200B;

Mostofi wrote that during the investigative process, it is not uncommon for the Title IX Office to speak to students several times with the intent of ascertaining the facts of a case, which are then presented to the Title IX coordinator. The Title IX coordinator has final authority over whether a claim, if true, is a violation of Stanford‚Äôs Title IX policy, according to Mostofi.

&amp;#x200B;

And after a protracted investigation ‚Äî Njuzi said she would go to the Title IX Office every couple of days to ask for a decision ‚Äî the office told her in her outcome letter, which was provided to The Daily, that her claims, even if taken as true, did not rise to the level of a Title IX violation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Under Title IX, discrimination on the basis of sex can include harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, stalking and nonforcible sexual violations. Stanford‚Äôs Title IX procedure defines sexual assault as any sexual act directed against a complaintant without affirmative consent.

&amp;#x200B;

The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of affirmative consent, according to the Title IX procedure.

&amp;#x200B;

Mostofi declined to comment on why the claims did not rise to the level of a Title IX violation.

&amp;#x200B;

Out of frustration, the three booked office hours slots with President Marc Tessier-Lavigne, who referred them to Senior Associate Vice Provost for Institutional Equity &amp; Access Lauren Schoenthaler.

&amp;#x200B;

The three said Schoenthaler was not of much help, at points making harmful comparisons. Njuzi said when she asked Schoenthaler why her claims did not rise to the level of a Title IX violation, Schoenthaler compared the situation to a ‚Äúcreepy‚Äù uncle and a child.

&amp;#x200B;

‚Äú‚ÄòYou might feel a little uncomfortable if he gives you a hug,‚Äô‚Äù Njuzi said Schoenthaler said. ‚Äú‚ÄòBut that‚Äôs just how family works.‚Äô‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Symere said Schoenthaler compared Symere‚Äôs steps of reporting to ‚Äúa kindergarten tattle-teller who proceeded to inform college counselors of \[Schoenthaler‚Äôs\] son cheating on a test years ago.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Schoenthaler wrote in a statement to The Daily that the tone and content of what was attributed to her was inaccurate and mischaracterized the conversation. She wrote that she did not nor would have suggested that it is alright to give someone a hug without affirmative consent, and said she would never equate an unwanted hug with sexual assault. ‚ÄúI addressed these students with dignity and respect,‚Äù she wrote.

&amp;#x200B;

Schoenthaler did note that ‚ÄúI do often discuss that some conduct is wrong but does not rise to the level of a policy violation, and I state that conduct is on a continuum giving examples of conduct on the continuum.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Following continued pressure from the students, Interim Title IX Coordinator Cathy Glaze alerted Symere in late April that the Office of Undergraduate Admissions would be stepping in on the case, with the Title IX Office aiding in conducting an independent review to determine if the responding student‚Äôs conduct violated Stanford‚Äôs Fundamental Standard, according to emails provided to The Daily.

&amp;#x200B;

According to Mostofi, final outcomes of an investigation by the admissions office could include a suspension or the revocation of an admissions offer. The University rescinded an incoming freshman football recruit‚Äôs admission in April after investigating his involvement as a witness to alleged sexual assault in 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

There is no one way schools address allegations of sufficient wrongdoing outside of Title IX‚Äôs scope, with methods depending on how the school is organized and the mission of different departments, according to Christine Helwick ‚Äô68, who has filled in for attorneys on leave in Title IX investigations at Stanford and also served as general counsel for the California State University system.

&amp;#x200B;

Given difficulties communicating with Glaze during the initial Title IX inquiry, Symere requested Glaze step down from the case, leaving Dean Shaw as the sole decision maker. The same Title IX investigators who turned down Symere‚Äôs case were assigned to investigating the potential Fundamental Standard violation.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúThese are the same people who I talked to and said my case has no validity,‚Äù Symere said. ‚ÄúThere was bias coming in.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Mostofi wrote that investigators do not make determinations about which cases can or cannot proceed.

&amp;#x200B;

The students ‚Äî Symere leading the case, with Njuzi and Clara serving as witnesses ‚Äî said the Title IX investigators were difficult to work with throughout the process. They insisted that she was under the influence at the time of the incident, Symere said. Njuzi said they zeroed in on how she hadn‚Äôt directly said no.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúAsking a victim multiple times, ‚ÄòDid you say no?‚Äô defeats the purpose of establishing what the correct kind of consent is in the first place,‚Äù Clara said. ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt say yes, or if a person is trying to back out, that‚Äôs not consent.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Mostofi wrote that investigators ask all parties about verbal and nonverbal signs of consent to get a complete understanding of what happened. ‚ÄúThe Title IX Office continues to use affirmative consent as the basis for whether there was a sexual assault or attempted acts of sexual assault,‚Äù Mostofi wrote.

&amp;#x200B;

Symere also provided screenshots of the responding student texting about women on campus, at one point writing ‚ÄúI‚Äôd take a bite outta that,‚Äù adding a peach emoji, which is often used to refer to buttocks.

&amp;#x200B;

In Symere‚Äôs outcome letter in August, which was provided to The Daily, Glaze wrote that the investigators determined that ‚Äúit is more likely than not that there was some sexual activity‚Äù at the off-campus location, ‚Äúand that you found it upsetting and violating.‚Äù But, the investigators also concluded that ‚Äúyou may not have accurately perceived the extent to which you were signaling your non-consent to the Respondent. Thus, \[the investigators\] were not able to find that the Respondent had violated the Fundamental Standard.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Glaze wrote that Shaw accepted the investigators‚Äô findings, and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions would sustain the respondent‚Äôs admission and enrollment. Glaze added that the incident occurred before the respondent had received Stanford training on affirmative consent and positive sexuality.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúI gave nothing,‚Äù Symere said. ‚ÄúSo I don‚Äôt know how or why I‚Äôm measuring my non-consent. If there‚Äôs not any consent, you shouldn‚Äôt be proceeding with anything.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how something sexual can occur that makes you feel violated and disrespected and not violate the Fundamental Standard ‚Äî which is literally about treating others with respect,‚Äù she added.

&amp;#x200B;

The Fundamental Standard states ‚ÄúStudents at Stanford are expected to show both within and without the University such respect for order, morality, personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to do this will be sufficient cause for removal from the University.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Mostofi declined to comment on Symere‚Äôs concerns about Shaw‚Äôs decision.

&amp;#x200B;

Contemporaneously with Stanford‚Äôs investigation, an external philanthropic organization that two of the students were involved with also investigated the matter and independently determined that neither of the allegations could be sustained, according to Mostofi. The philanthropic organization declined to disclose information to The Daily about the investigation, including whether it occurred. 

&amp;#x200B;

The foundation also declined to comment on how the determination was reached and what standards were used. According to two of the students, the foundation declined to answer the student‚Äôs questions about the ruling or allow her to speak about the situation with the foundation‚Äôs director.

&amp;#x200B;

And the students said Stanford‚Äôs decision could have dangerous consequences for other students on campus: ‚ÄúLife continues beyond Stanford,‚Äù Symere said. ‚ÄúWith this decision, Stanford is reinforcing his view that what he‚Äôs doing is okay.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*\*

&amp;#x200B;

In the 2018-19 academic year, the Title IX Office received 279 reports of sexual harassment, sexual violence and gender discrimination, with 20 reports of nonconsensual intercourse and 20 reports of nonconsensual touching, according to the 2018-19 Title IX/Sexual Harassment Annual Report released by the University. Most cases had a ‚Äúnon-investigation outcome,‚Äù an umbrella term for matters that are concluded without a formal investigation.

&amp;#x200B;

Of the non-consensual intercourse allegations, there were just four formal completed investigations, with two findings of a policy violation. For the non-consensual touching allegations, there were eight completed investigations, with four findings of a policy violation.

&amp;#x200B;

Only a small percentage of those who say they‚Äôve experienced sexual violence report the incident to the Title IX Office.

&amp;#x200B;

14.2% of respondents to a survey organized by the Association of American Universities reported experienced at least one instance of nonconsensual sexual contact at Stanford, with 31.1% of undergraduate women reporting an instance. 

&amp;#x200B;

Advocates said difficulties students face in pursuing sexual violence cases stem from both the people and the procedures involved. 

&amp;#x200B;

Maia Brockbank ‚Äô21, who co-directs sexual violence prevention and Title IX for the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU), said college campuses, including Stanford, can be breeding grounds for repeat offenders. She added that the University has an incentive to not take responsibility for such cases when possible. ‚ÄúStill,‚Äù she said, ‚Äúother private university administrators are not making policies that are this harmful and damage survivors.‚Äù 

&amp;#x200B;

Activist and law professor Michele Dauber, who declined to comment on a specific scenario, said the University does not have a written policy governing reporting incidents before matriculation. She said a lack of such a policy was especially dangerous, given that some students who matriculate at Stanford have interacted with other matriculated Stanford students whether at summer programs or by attending the same high school.

&amp;#x200B;

Mostofi declined to comment on whether the University has a written policy governing such reports.

&amp;#x200B;

All advocates interviewed said they had concerns about Shaw‚Äôs qualifications to adjudicate such cases. Brockbank said adjudicating cases of sexual violence is not Shaw‚Äôs job. 

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúIt feels like it‚Äôs part of a pattern of the Title IX Office doing everything they can to reduce their caseload and punt it to other people,‚Äù Brockbank said. 

&amp;#x200B;

Shaw did not respond to request for comment directly, and Mostofi, responding on behalf of the University, declined to comment on Shaw‚Äôs qualifications.

&amp;#x200B;

Some advocates also said that Glaze and Schoenthaler have been hard to work with and, at times, dismissive of student concerns. Dauber said her experience working with those involved in crafting and executing Title IX policies is entirely consistent with that of students on campus. 

&amp;#x200B;

Dauber said that the lack of trust in the Title IX Office has harmful consequences for students considering reporting incidents and that now is the time for the University to take dramatic steps in order to create trust, including by making procedural and personnel changes.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúThis is a hair-on-fire emergency,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf you have offices and procedures that students don‚Äôt trust, no one will report, and that makes a dangerous campus.‚Äù

&amp;#x200B;

Brockbank and Julia Paris ‚Äô21, who also co-directs sexual violence prevention and Title IX for the ASSU, commended the three students for their efforts to obtain justice through the University‚Äôs Title IX system, adding that they worry for students who don‚Äôt have the ability or willingness to go through the system.

&amp;#x200B;

‚ÄúHow many others are out there who don‚Äôt want to go through this obstacle course?‚Äù Brockbank asked.

2020-11-18 10:31:17,We need a registry to track this stuff.,"So I've been bouncing this around in my head for a while now. I think that we need a registry or database for keeping track of everytime governments or the UN creates a policy that hurts men or excludes them from the benefits that they give to women. 

While this sub (and others like it) have been an awesome place to bring these issues to the forefront and discuss them I feel like we need a place where we can compile and store this data.

My reasons are twofold:

**1.)** **It a great way to catalog all of this information for future reference.**

Many of us know that the situation is bad. But we don't know the full extent of it because of how insular this community is and how isolated sources are. Let's face it, a lot of what we have is fairly disparate because the academic institutions and media only let one or two studies or expose slip through. Oftentimes the information is accidentally discovered while the researcher is seeking to prove the opposite or is a by-product of some other study. Having this all in one place in an open-source format would allow us to take advantage of our numbers and potentially enlighten other people to what's happening.

**2.)** **The powers that be want to shut us down**

We have to face the fact that social media platforms are hostile towards any space that presents men's issues in any way that doesn't completely vilify men. Groups like this one have been getting banned for months by Fakebook, Reddit, Twitter and the like. In addition, YouTube has waged an all out war against content creators who are sympathetic to men's issues. 

In addition, in the U.S. (Where most of the social media giants are headquartered), the President elect has already signalled that he is going to use his power to clamp down on what he sees as abusive language on social media. 

In my opinion, this is just the excuse that woke administrators are looking for to discriminate against us. We have little idea what all he plans to do. But if his work in Senate or as the VP is any indication of his leanings, I'd say that it's going to be bye bye for men's groups.
Hopefully I'm wrong. But I'd like to make sure that we have a safe haven for when this does happen.

Wikipedia has an article about it but doesn't have anything to say about its replacement, though it discusses reversals where a woman saves a man. But I find it hard to believe that the reversals will become popular. 

Or perhaps I just don't get it. Perhaps the kids nowadays don't care who saves whom. Or what. In that case young women watch romantic movies where men have to saved and young men movies where men save only robots or planets or other men.

I am not a movie watcher at all, but once or twice a year I like to indulge with my husband. This time we watched the Wes Anderson animated film ""Isle of Dogs"". I chose this movie since the reviews were fantastic and I like animated films. I found a few things about the film rather unsettling, but one thing that left me totally disturbed and disgusted is that a female high school student professes to have a crush on a 12 year old boy (the main character), and even worse is that they develop this ""romance"" and the two characters end up arm in arm sharing ice cream after the 12 year old calls the high school senior ""attractive"". My advice to this literal child being hit on by a near or actual adult would be to say no and tell an adult. 

Like I said, I don't typically enjoy movies so I don't know how normal this is but it really turned me off. I checked on the wikipedia page to see if it was mentioned in the critical response and that maybe I missed it somehow when checking the reviews. Apparently this wasn't a problem for reviewers?

2020-11-19 11:18:54,"It's international men's day today, so the BBC posted an article bashing men","Take a quick read for yourself. No evidence...just casual sexist discussion about how women are supposedly better than men.

""Have women CEOs coped better with Covid than men?""

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54974132](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54974132)

Would it be published if the genders were reversed? Oh no. Would it be published if you replaced men with white and women with black? What do you think?

I would really, really strongly encourage as many of you as possible to tweet the BBC about this article and their CONSTANT anti-male rhetoric. @ bbcpress and #bbccomplaints may be good tags to use.

It would also be really great if you could officially complain here (takes just a few minutes):

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaints](https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaints)

I would also ask you all to make it your mission this year to call the BBC out on their constant sexism. Because they are explicitly feminist, despite being a publicly funded organisation in the UK and they have probably spent more time talking about the damn gender pay gap than they have talking about all men's issues combined about 5 times over. Even if they rarely have an article about male suicide rates they will do the 'this is why we need more feminism so men feel they can talk more' thing and 'balance' their article out with stats about women.

2020-11-20 00:43:31,I made a Docu-Series for MENS DAY! All episodes are available now.,"For Mens Day this year I wanted to make a docu-series going into the lives of as many men as I could, with the hope of producing at least 12 episodes. Due to covid and other issues I really only managed to make three this year, and there are some technical issues as it was my first attempt at th documentary format but I do hope you guys enjoy it regardless.

Episode 1: Wyatt the Toy designer, about a young man who designs toys for a living. His story focuses on many of his designs that never got produced and his journey realizing that he doesn't want to spend his whole life doing just one job.

&amp;#x200B;

Episode 2: Gad the musician, focusing on a man who found he was passionate about music at a young age, but gave it up for ten years to focus on business and trying to be a 'winner'. His music has that chill lo-fi feeling, i highly recommend this one.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK58chX3NG4&amp;t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK58chX3NG4&amp;t)

&amp;#x200B;

Episode 3: Luke living with autism, focuses on the history of a young man who got diagnosed with autism at an early age, in a time where people weren't as PC as they are today, and all the hardships he faced. Despite not being neurotypical, his struggles to simply find a way to support himself and one day a family really highlights the struggle that men as a whole feel to be the primary provider for a family in a world that has made it increasingly difficult. Luke lives on a different continent from me, so he had to film his segment all on his own.

&amp;#x200B;

hopefully next year I can do even more episodes and get the quality to look and sound more professional, but I do hope you guys enjoy it for what it is. I would appreciate if you share it wherever you could, I would just love to put something out for mens day that people can't say is negative or angry, I just wanted to make something that spreads male positivity and shows the real lives of real men.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jx64q5/i_made_a_docuseries_for_mens_day_all_episodes_are/,LonelyBobcat

If Google could acknowledge it that would actually be a big step and raise awareness and have people take it more seriously.

That aside, what I'm suggesting is we all donate a small amount to a men's charity- for example prostate cancer research. I donated ¬£5 to Prostate Cancer UK which isn't much but if we all do that it will make a difference. I attached a screenshot if that counts as proof.

If today is to be taken seriously we need to be seen doing something other than talk about the lack of Google Doodles.

2020-11-20 01:49:59,An ethical dilemma I saw online.,"On an internet group I occasionally browse, a user said that he spoke to a woman who was in contact with a woman who arranged to have sex with a strange man purely to conceive a child. They weren't in a relationship, they didn't know each other, the woman just wanted to get pregnant, and the man had been informed of her intent beforehand. Not exactly normal, but it's their business, right? The problem is, he was, as the woman discovered later, was wearing a condom. People on this board are debating whether or not this man raped this woman. The woman was asking OP if legally speaking, she had a leg to stand on. I genuinely don't understand what the issue is, though. Okay, so the man is a bit of a prick, but a rapist? I don't believe so. If the man had *not* been wearing a condom when they had agreed that he would - ""ghosting"", I believe the term is these days - *then* I'd agree that an assault had been committed. As it is, though, I'm being called a scumbag for disagreeing that an actual crime has been committed.

Furthermore, on this occasion, I wish to express him (and you all, MRA's) my appreciation and gratitude that there is someone who cares about the almost 80% of suicides of boys and men we have as well as about not only abuses against females but also against boys and men (e.g. abuse of the law, psychological abuse, violence abuse, etc.).

A pseudo science is a a set of beliefs that do not conform with the scientific method. One of the important things about the scientific method is the idea that every theorie has to be falsifiable. Everything has to have an observation that can be made to disregard the theorie.

The problem with feminism and mostly the patriarchy that they claim exist is that is a pseudo science and not falsifiable.
For example, if something is harder for women that is because men hate them. If something is easier for women it‚Äôs because men think they are worse at it.

There isn‚Äôt really an observation that can disprove the patriarchy making an invalid science.",1.0,2.0,1.0,11.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jx8nc1/is_feminism_a_pseudo_science/,partypotato2003

2020-11-20 03:52:04,Open letter Happy international mens day! (From me to whome need to hear it).,"Hello guys. I'm Saph and would like to wish you all a very happy international mens day. I wanted to say a few things because it should be said.

First I only found out it was international men's day... Well today. I'm living here in the US and hadn't heard anything about it. It's actually kind of sad that it's not getting the coverage that it deserves. So if the rest of media people won't talk about it then I will.

So on behalf of me as a woman to the rest of all of you. I love you guys. We love you guys. We respect you and thank you for all that you do.

Thank you to the dad's working that extra shift not help not only his family but maybe his friend, a sister, a brother, a boss, or even himself.

To the men who offer that helping and go unsung, thank you.

To the father's who taught lessons to their communities and families, thank you.

To the dad's (like mine) who were never there, we forgive you. Love you. Please come home.

To soldiers, security guards, factory workers, health care workers, and anyone puting their life on the line both in work and in play, thank you for being our heroes. Thank your for holding the line.

To the inventors, scientists, artists, thinkers, engineers, builders, all creators please continue to make the world beautiful.

To you guys dealing with depression, loneliness, abandonment, false accusation, pain, loss... Both in people and in faith... I choose to believe humanity is good I am so sorry for the pain you have felt. It will get better. You are loved. There are people who will listen to you. And if no one has reminded you yet it's very heroic to keep going for even just one more day. That little act of getting up out of bed and not letting the pain win something that is to be admired about men.

I'd rather not ramble on for too much longer but I just wanted to say happy international mens day. And as my grandfather once told me ""never let these damn fools drive you crazy"".

2020-11-20 05:44:54,"Child Support, Economic Slavery &amp; Misandry","#INTRODUCTION
*Men's reproductive rights are rarely if at all discussed in the mainstream. Just look at what happens when you tell a feminist that there are 'no rights to take away from men' in a conversation where she screeches about pro-lifers wanting to take away women's abortions or hell just look at what happens when you tell the average person that there are male statutory rape victims who are still paying child support. You are always met with the same confused and or angry look or you are hit with male hyperagency/'women pay child support, too' type of arguments.*

*In more pro-choice countries, women are not seen as active agents who consent to be parents once intercourse takes place and because of that they are not legally obliged to be parents - they have access to safe abortions. Am I saying it is always easy to get an abortion especially if you live in a traditional pro-life family? No, but on average a woman has the choice to refuse parenthood no matter the cause of the pregnancy. On the other hand, a man is assumed to be an agent who consents to be a parent which means he can be held accountable for his actions and since men don't have the same autonomy as women, the only way to hold them accountable is to order men who don't want to be parents to pay child support to the mother who has full control over her partner's or ex-partner's fate, that is she decides whether the child is born or not (the father has no legal right to intervene, but he can be held accountable and forced to financially support the choices of the mother. It is unlawful of him to refuse to do so).*

#MEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
I dug up some info on men's reproductive rights, specifically in the US, and the idea that a man is accountable for his actions, that is he consents to be a father at the time of conception is so embedded in family courts that even boys/men who have been a victim of stolen sperm, also known as 'sperm jacking', sexual abuse or even men who are not the genetic fathers of the child can sometimes be ordered to pay child support. ""The child is an innocent party, therefore his/her needs have to be put before the needs of the man"" is a common excuse which courts have used to rationalise their misandry.

Quoting from: [When male victims are held accountable](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201902/when-male-rape-victims-are-accountable-child-support%3famp)

&gt;Seyer was 12 when he was raped by his 16-year-old babysitter Colleen Hermesmann who became pregnant and in 1989 was charged with statutory rape. Instead of being convicted of rape, Hermesmann was declared a juvenile offender under the non-sexual offense of 'contributing to child misconduct'. Seyer was subsequently court-ordered to pay child support. 

That's one story where a victim of rape in spite of being a minor was ordered to pay child support by the very same system that is said to 'protect' rape victims. We can confidently assert this is economic slavery and victim blaming. The story continues:

&gt;In 1993, at age 15, Seyer appealed this decision to the Kansas Supreme Court, arguing he should not be liable for these payments. He maintained that his babysitter (Hermesmann) took advantage of him when he was too young to give consent. The court ruled against him and the judge stated that because Seyer initially 'consented' to the sexual encounters and never told his parents what was happening, he was responsible for supporting the child. 

This is a a clear example of male hyperagency, victim blaming and rape culture. It gets even worse:

&gt;This court case set a precedent for male rape victims to make child-support payments. The financial needs of the child outweigh the court's interest in deterring sexual crimes against male minors, even if statutory rape is the cause of conception. 

Clearly, the 'financial needs' of the child don't just 'outweigh' the needs of the victim as the judge made it quite clear he was okay with the boy being raped as he 'consented'. This isn't the one and only incident where the 'needs of the child' have been used to rationalise such disgusting treatment of male rape victims. There are more stories some of which are quite recent. 

&gt;In 2014, Nick Olivas of Arizona was forced to pay over $15,000 in back-payments to a woman who raped him when he was 14. She was 20 years old at the time. 

Being forced to pay over $15,000 to your rapist and having to fear the consequences of not doing so (such as potential jail time, loss of civil rights) definitely doesn't sound oppressive, does it?

&gt;In 1996, the court heard the case of County of San Luis Obispo v. Nathaniel J in which a 34-year-old woman became pregnant after sexually exploiting a 15-year-old boy. He was also forced to pay child support, and then Deputy Attorney General Mary Roth alleged: 'I guess he thought he was a man then. Now, he prefers to be considered a child'.

Can you imagine if a girl was told 'I guess she thought she was a woman then. Now, she prefers to be considered a child' in response to her being a rape victim and wanting to be relieved from the obligation of having to financially support another human for years?

The next story is that of a male rape victim who was incapacitated and incapable of consenting, but was still ordered to pay child support in spite of the fact that the courts were aware of the incident. 

Quoting from: [Fatherhood by conscription](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761333)

&gt;In 1992, an Alabama man (S.F.) attended a party at the home of a female friend (T.M). He arrived at the party intoxicated and shortly thereafter passed out in a bed. The other partygoers eventually left for the evening, leaving S.F. in the sole care of T.M. When S.F. awoke the next morning, he was surprised to find that all of his clothing had been removed during the night. Over the next few months, T.M. would openly boast to several people about how she had engaged in sexual intercourse with S.F. while he was unconscious. She would even go as far as to describe the evening as one that had 'saved her a trip to the sperm bank'. T.M. gave birth to a child, and genetic testing confirmed that S.F. was the biological father. The state of Alabama, on behalf of T.M., brought an action against S.F. to collect child support. The lower court entered a judgement against S.F., requiring him to pay $106 a week and also $8,960 in arrears. 

&gt;On appeal, S.F. argued that the court should relieve him of the liability given that 'he did not have consensual intercourse with T.M. and that he was a victim of sexual assault by T.M. The court, however, rejected S.F.'s argument, stating: 'The child is an innocent party... [A]ny wrongful conduct on the part of the mother should not alter the father's duty to provide support for the child'.  

In other words, the rapist boasted about being a rapist, bragged about impregnating herself, but the court refused to take that into consideration and instead put the victim in the good 'provider' box that was built for him. These are just some amongst possibly tons of other cases where a male victim of rape has been held accountable for his rapist's misconduct and forced to financially support her child. In each case, the court ruled against the victim despite knowing he was the victim. 

There's more and this one is beyond ludicrous:

&gt;Similar to S.F., in In re Paternity of Daniel S.H., a Wisconsin father, Daniel, claimed that the mother, Jennifer, engaged in nonconsensual sexual intercourse with him after lacing his drink with ‚Äúa date rape drug.‚Äù In an action to collect child support for the resulting child (a son named Derek), the lower court allowed Daniel to introduce evidence of nonconsent. Even so, the court placed the burden of proof on Daniel, requiring him ‚Äúto prove all factual issues by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence."" Ultimately, ‚Äú[t]he jury found that Daniel‚Äôs sexual intercourse with Jennifer was involuntary."" Nevertheless, the lower court still required Daniel to pay child support.On appeal, Daniel argued that the lower court‚Äôs order was in error and that ‚Äúthe jury‚Äôs finding of lack of consent should bar or reduce his child support obligation.‚Äù

&gt;The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, however, agreed with the lower court because ‚Äú[t]he paramount goal of any child support decision is to secure the best interests of the child‚Äù and that, in this case, ‚ÄúDerek was not at fault‚Äù and thus ‚Äúwas entitled to receive child support from both parents.‚Äù Despite agreeing with the lower court‚Äôs determination of child support, the Court of Appeals nonetheless disagreed with the lower court putting the issue of consent to the jury. Specifically, the Court of Appeals found no statutory basis for permitting a jury to consider consent when ruling on the issue of child support. Instead, the Court of Appeals ruled that the only real question the jury had to answer was whether Daniel was the father: ‚ÄúDaniel had a right to have a jury decide whether he is Derek‚Äôs father. However, Daniel admitted he was Derek‚Äôs father. As a result, a judgment of paternity was entered. When the court determined that Daniel was Derek‚Äôs father, Daniel‚Äôs right to a jury trial was extinguished.‚Äù

*What about 'stolen' sperm, a.k.a sperm jacking and paternity fraud?*

Control over men's reproductive and sexual health is not as uncommon as most people would like to believe. In fact, it is fact it is very common.

Quoting from: [Battered men: the hidden side of domestic violence. A review of CDC data](http://www.batteredmen.com/NISVS.htm)

&gt;Approximately 10.4% (or an estimated 11.7 million) of men in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control."" 8.6% (or an estimated 10.3 million) of women in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant when they did not want. (page 48.) 

One example is that of a man who was ordered to pay child support because he had engaged in oral sex with a nurse who allegedly took the sperm from his condom and used it to impregnate herself. 

&gt;In 1983, Emile was visiting his sick parents at a Louisiana hospital. One evening, a nurse, Debra, offered to perform oral sex on him, but only if he wore a condom. He accepted. At the end of their sexual encounter, Debra agreed to dispose of the used condom. Emile, however, never witnessed this disposal and thus could not say what Debra ultimately did with either the condom or its contents. Nine months later she gave birth to a child, and genetic testing revealed a 99.9% probability that Emile was the father. The two never had sexual intercourse, only the one instance of oral sex with a condom. Nearly ten years later, the state filed an action against Emile to collect child support. Despite his objections, the lower court ordered the man to pay $436 per month, $17,909 in arrears, and 5% court costs. 

&gt;The Court of Appeals of Louisiana affirmed, stating that '[t]he fact of paternity obliges a father to support his child'. In addressing the issue of Debra's self-insemination without Emile's consent, the court dismissed the point, merely noting that '[Emile's] own testimony showed that he had some sort of sexual contact with the plaintiff around the time frame of alleged conception'. The fact that any sexual contact occurred was sufficient to hold Emile liable for child support. 

To summarise, engaging in sexual intercourse is enough to hold a man accountable for a child even if that child was conceived because a woman impregnated herself without his knowledge. 

Here's another one:

&gt;An appellate court in Illinois reached a similar result in Phillips v. Irons. In that case, Dr. Richard Phillips and Dr. Sharon Irons began a dating relationship, during which time the couple engaged in oral sex on three occasions. The two never had sexual intercourse because Irons told Phillips that she was menstruating and thus needed to refrain from vaginal intercourse. Nonetheless, Phillips alleged that, unbeknownst to him, Irons used Phillips‚Äôs semen (obtained from oral sex) to successfully inseminate herself. Subsequently, Irons gave birth to a daughter and, soon thereafter, filed a ‚ÄúPetition to Establish Paternity and Other Relief ‚Äù against Phillips. Because he had ended the relationship with Irons over a year prior, Phillips had no knowledge of Irons‚Äôs pregnancy or the birth of the child. Nonetheless, DNA testing proved that Phillips was the biological father. Ignoring the deceptive manner in which the child was conceived, the court awarded child support to Irons in the amount of $800 a month, which was later increased to $1,600 a month.

Self-insemination is just one way a woman can deceive a man and impregnate herself. Lying about being on the pill, poking a hole in a man's condom are two other ways this can happen. 

Paternity fraud is another issue that arises from strict liability. However, it is a more tricky one as some states have enacted protections to protect men from the practice such as Texas which passed a new law which allows men who doubt paternity a chance to file a claim. This allowed a Dallas man who was jailed due to his inability to pay child support to contest an accusation that he was the biological father. After a DNA paternity test disproved the claim of paternity, he was released from jail. 
[Child support when paternity is in doubt](https://mensrights.com/child-support-when-paternity-is-in-doubt/)

However, that doesn't eliminate paternity fraud as a whole and stop it from happening, say, in other states or countries. A couple of examples are the story of Chris Atkins who spent 11 years raising a daughter that was not his, but was still required by law to pay child support because his name was on her birth certificate. Atkins claims that despite paying, he doesn't have visitation rights.

The other story is that of a man from Detroit, Carnell Alexander who refused to pay child support for a child that was proven to not be his. As a result, a warrant was issued for his arrest.

#GENDER INEQUALITY 
Quoted from: Fatherhood by Conscription: Nonconsensual Insemination and the Duty of Child Support (link above)

&gt;In her book, The Neutered Mother, the Sexual Family and Other Twentieth Century Tragedies, Professor Martha Albertson Fineman points out that ‚Äú[w]hile the dominant aspirational story for the past decades has been one of spousal ‚Äòequality,‚Äô great gender inequality in the allocation of the burdens and costs associated with family operation continues to affect how this story is played out in real lives.‚Äù The current approach to child support adjudication is a prime example of the inequality to which Fineman refers. Indeed, the few commentators who have criticized the court‚Äôs current approach of holding male victims liable for child support have done so primarily based on the way in which the current approach violates gender equality.

&gt;Ellen London‚Äôs commentary is particularly instructive: 'The traditional conceptions of power, dominance, and victimization employed by these courts precluded the judges from providing the defendants with a fair or adequate solution. Little doubt exists that the judges in these cases would have written different opinions if the victims were female‚Äîilluminating how men are viewed as the responsible party in a sexual encounter and women have no corresponding agency.' In fact, consider the one case in which a court was called upon to decide whether a female victim of sexual assault was liable for child support. In DCSE/Esther M.C. v. Mary L., a mother refused to provide support for her three minor children on the basis that they were ‚Äúthe result of an incestuous relationship with her brother,‚Äù and, as such, ‚Äúit was not a voluntary decision on her part to have the minor children.‚Äù In ruling, the court did what no court has ever done when confronted with the child support obligations of a male victim of sexual assault‚Äîthe court ruled that the mother may not be liable. According to the court, ‚Äú[i]f the sexual intercourse which results in the birth of a child is involuntary or without actual consent, a mother may have ‚Äòjust cause‚Äô . . . for failing or refusing to support such a child.‚Äù

The concept of paternity, male responsibility and liability are so ingrained in the system that professor Hubin notes:

&gt;Under contemporary legal standards, it has 
become a ‚Äúsettled approach‚Äù that ‚Äúgenetic relationships establish legal paternity regardless of whether the genetic fathers gave legal consent, or were capable of giving legal consent, to an act of
sexual intercourse that resulted in the pregnancies.‚Äù

As one commentator describes:

&gt;""[W]hile courts have declared that child support obligations are dependent on voluntary parenthood, they are often reluctant to look to consent for guidance.‚Äù Nonetheless, despite the number of times this question has arisen, every single court has answered it in the affirmative‚Äîholding that, yes, the father, minor or not, is liable. 

Perhaps, actual systemic progress has been made, but I, alongside many other people, are yet to see it. Stop the abuse. Don't hold victims accountable. Give men and especially boys the right to choose.

2020-11-20 08:55:03,Today is Men's day. This is how you celebrate it.,"We must first celebrate this day by acknowledging our toxic masculinity, chastising ourselves for it, while recognizing the fact that this day is inherently sexist.

Every Men's day should start with an injection of estrogen. Two injections if you're overly masculine. And shave your chest in the name of equality.

After the injection we must fast until noon so that our bodies muscles deteriorate, because muscles are also sexist. You must fast all day if you're a especially large male to prevent man-spreading and taking too much space.

We must then go to our local libraries and borrow all books on biology. Take the books home and burn them in our backyards, because they are also sexist by promoting the absurd idea that men and women are different.

If you catch yourself mansplaining throughout the day (aka stating your opinion and following it with facts), then you must immediately hit yourself in the head repeatedly with a book on feminism to promote submissiveness and prevent further mansplaining.

At the end of the day you will not masturbate, especially to pornography. But if you must, you will do so by lying in bed in your favorite sun dress and closing your eyes while thinking about strong women. I preferably like to think about larger women with short hair to challenge gender norms.

2020-11-20 15:14:15,"He misses his daughter. It's a long post, but feedback would be great.","**Hello everyone here...**

**I'm sure 99.999% of you on here are men. I know you are a men's rights group. I wish that you read this post as if he had written it himself, and give helpful feedback if you can.**   
**I am a woman** ....but I will agree that in the words of Euripides  
*""There is no worse evil than a bad woman, and nothing has ever been produced better than a good one""*

**I am posting on behalf of my boyfriend. I am sure this is going to get lengthy, I apologize.**

He and I were acquainted for many years, but never close. When he would contact me I would avoid him. I can't even begin to explain why. I realize now how guarded I kept myself the past few years. Previously, he and I were never romantic. We were simply great at talking to each other when we did see each other. Two years ago, right when I really needed someone to talk to, he was there. He asked me out. It was a great time. We started getting together as a routine. I still remember the moment I realized how great of a person he is. It's hard for me to admit that I so easily fell in love with him. He is a wonderful human being. He is my best friend. We are a great team, and that's all I have ever wanted.

**I just want to express this before I get into the meat of this post.**  
He is sweet and loving. He's reliable. He has a great job. He always strives to be the best version of himself he can be. He is the most temperate man I have ever met.  
And unlike the mother of his child, he has no criminal record to speak of. He owns his own home.  
*I could go on but then I would be bragging on his behalf...*

**Now, to the reason for the post.**  
He has a daughter.  
The mother of his child is alienating her from him. She wants control of everything. Refuses to let him have independent time with his daughter. Long ago he would try to ask to be added to the birth certificate and she would say it wasn't possible.  
*He admits that he procrastinated in finding out that this was a lie.*  
Her main motive has always been to not share his child with him. She wants 100%. She doesn't have friends her own age and asserts that her daughter is her best friend. Taking her away just for a weekend would ""ruin"" her.

**Some examples...**

* To encourage her to call him by his first name... she's 6.
* Grabs her and tells her that *""Daddy doesn't love us anymore""* \-Storms out with child-
* Mother and Father talk, Mother gets upset. Starts crying and telling the daughter *""Daddy hurt my feelings""* daughter goes over and hits dad blaming him for hurting mommy's feelings.
* She hangs up the phone when he was on facetime with their daughter, he calls back and the mother screams at him for being with me (I wasn't even at the house at the time). She was upset because she doesn't want me to be in the house while he was on a call with her. Since it was Facetime he promptly hung up after seeing his daughter sitting there petrified.

*I could go on and on but you get the idea.*  
**Basically, she uses his daughter as the key to breaking his heart.**

They broke up long before he and I got together. She left when she went on a regular tirade and started living an hour away at her parent's home. When he and I started seeing each other, I pushed for him to get on the birth certificate. He filled out the Acknowledgment of Paternity. The mother resisted going to the notary but eventually gave in.

**He then obtained a lawyer and filed for Custody.** When she found out that he was filing, she asserted that *""(Daughter) will never stay overnight with you, over my dead body""*. This left him astonished, I guess he thought she would be reasonable...

**She countered him with a request for support.** That's fine and was totally expected. He wants to pay his share. They went to mediation and couldn't agree on anything. She would only agree to him having supervised visits (by her) every other weekend. Seeing as it was more than what he was currently getting, he agreed on the basis that they were going to court 6 months later for custody.  
*In my opinion, this was when he should have walked in with a cohesive plan, or asked for a step-up plan that was structured, and if he didn't get that.... not sign a damn thing.* It seems that in him agreeing - it put everything off when it could have been seen by a judge by now.

**A month later the support hearing took place.** Initially, he wanted a flat fee lawyer, which proved to really screw things up. His lawyer didn't provide the mother's attorney with the discovery documents that they asked for. They ruled that he pay $400 MORE a month than what would have been figured if his lawyer had provided the appropriate documents. He wants to pay his fair share... but that really threw a wrench into things. *I can explain more why this happened if people are interested and possibly help anyone avoid a similar outcome.*

**He has now filed for a ""De Novo"" hearing** with what seems to be a competent lawyer. Kind of a bulldog, but the type he needs. It is now going to Circuit Court and will be seen completely *anew.* Not an appeal. It's a real do-over and final decision - that will determine support (with the correct information this time) and include a determination on physical custody as well.

**It's worth noting that he wants 50/50 but was willing to work around 135 days a year (it's a very specific schedule) to not disrupt daughters school schedule - His lawyer is pushing for primary, which I think he could do - he just has a hard time conceptualizing that the shoe could be on the other foot. He's just as good of a parent as she is - if not better - and he wouldn't impede on her time.**

**Meanwhile, he has been filling out a daily agenda** on every interaction he has with the mother. He has been asking for more time. Making sure he doesn't miss any opportunity to see his daughter. When they get into general conversation, the mother is constantly probing for information.

Most recently her response has been that she will call up the Support Services and ""*drop the support case*"" if he agrees to drop his custody case. üôÑ  
He said, **""Hell no, this whole thing is about having time with my daughter""**  
He will continue to pay more than $1000 a month until a judge sees their case.  
***His daughter is worth it.***

**I hear how unsure he is when he talks to me about this. The mother is constantly telling him that a judge will side with her, and he isn't sold on the idea that if he fights for the time that he will get it. I am sure he will get it, especially with how the mother has been so obstructive to his involvement.**

**I would really appreciate it if he could just have something for him to read and feel reassured. From people who do not know him. People with no dogs in the race. A community that has some insight to give him some advice, some love, some confidence. He isn't the type of guy that would seek out the advice of strangers on the internet, but I think that strangers might be the best reassurance. This is a community of men that are dedicated to getting through the hardships of being single dads and sometimes having to fight for custody.**

*I just want him to feel confident while weathering the storm... for his daughter.*

Obviosly, the flowers made him very happy and he proudly put the flowers in a vase on his desk so that the note (saying ""Just wanted to show my appreciation for you on international mens day"") was visible for anyone. 

Awareness sucessfully spread!

Apparently there was some misunderstanding during the delivery too, a woman came running to the flower delivery since it was a three year anniversary between her and her husband and she though the flowers were for her haha

He then came home very happy and must have thanked me like a dozen times throughout the day, admitting he liked how jealous his colleagues were and repeating how I am the best girlfriend ever.

Well, it turns out she planted them in her garden and cultivated them and alas they started to grow. Now anyone who has grown pumpkins knows that they will take over the garden and pretty much kill any other plants around.

Even with this knowledge, she planted them. Yesterday, I got a bill in the mail from her to cover the cost of her garden being ruined. Apparently, all her flowers are gone, all her other vegetables are dead and now she wants me to pay to have all of them replaced.

2020-11-21 14:53:06,A bit disappointed with this sub,"When I first found this sub I was super happy. Men‚Äôs rights is a passion of mine and I‚Äôve been advocating for it ever since I recognised the discrimination men face.
I would describe myself as someone who fights for gender equality and often use the label of a feminist in the original sense of the word. Most of the time I find myself advocating for whoever is being forgotten. Almost always this is men. In conversations and discussions about how ‚Äúeasy‚Äù men get it, I make sure to bring up the issues and discrimination they face. But at the same time, in conversations about how ‚Äúeasy‚Äù women get it, I make sure to bring up the issues and discrimination they face too.
When I joined this sub and saw posts advocating for Jonny Depp against Amber Heard, posting about International Men‚Äôs Day, body positivity for men, statistics for the hardships men face and general men‚Äôs rights activism, I was stoked! This is the stuff I‚Äôm passionate about and joined the sub for. But then after a while I noticed my feed was being filled with all these anti-feminism posts that feminism is a mental disability, that feminists hate men, that feminists want women‚Äôs supremacy and all these things that I would consider hateful. 
I was really disappointed as I‚Äôd joined this sub for the positivity and activism only to be met with more hate",1.0,1.0,1.0,27.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jy6flb/a_bit_disappointed_with_this_sub/,BB_Jack

My dad has never been the type of person to discuss emotions, and we have always had a strained relationship because we dont quite understand each other's struggles.

I won't get into detail, but it is the first time in about 6 years that I have hugged my father, and we have developed a better understanding of each other. He had a lot to talk about, and I urge every man to ask their fathers (in an isolated environment) about their feelings.

With all the discussions of  ""rape culture"", the good father is, almost by definition, domesticated  and therefore safe. From a political/economic perspective he's tied down  and predictable. He's obviously got a loving wife, so we assume his  mental health is being taken care of. At least we can all still point to  him as a good man who *won't let us down*  like all the other men do. By contrast, the young single man is a loose  cannon, the older one questionable, probably with skeletons in his  closet.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jy7tf6/an_interesting_take_on_why_the_gentle_father/,smeltaway

I am looking for a book, or an essay, or a Youtube lecture, that presents both the feminist point of view and the antifeminist one. Something that tries to clean up the ideological mess and sees through the propaganda. I asked for that in AskFeminists. I was told there is no such a work to their best knowledge, and I was redirected to contemporary feminist books like ""Me, not you"". 

But I CAN'T STAND THOSE BOOKS! If you want I can share with you all the inaccurate points the authors make, or the opinions presented as facts I identified before being fed up and throwing the books in the bin.

2020-11-23 03:22:47,How feminist shaming tactics needlessly cause lasting sexual repression or guilt in a subset of men most sympathetic to feminist concerns.,"A crosspost from /r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates  Because I felt like a lot of people there resonated with this post and I would like to share it more.

When I was a young man I saw myself as a proud feminist. I thought, ""what kind of person wouldn't stand up for women's rights?"" I had no problem with wearing pink t-shirts, having female friends, or stereotypically feminine interests like playing princess or having tea parties. Though, as I got older, borders seemed to vanish. I even remember playing barbies with my neighbors so much, one year I asked my parents for a barbie dream carriage for Christmas. And they got it for me. They were super progressive about this stuff. But I was also bullied heavily for a number of reasons. And come high school, there was an elective course on women's studies offered.

And the girls enrolled in it. And used what they learned as a bludgeon to bully the guys they didn't like. It wasn't just that they disliked the guy who asked them out awkwardly. Now, he was a creepy entitled misogynist objectifying them. Any guy they didn't like who talked about girls and his attraction to them (as hormone-filled teenage boys do) were labeled as sexual abusers and predators. The message we got was clear: ""As a man, you do NOT show your interest unless she expresses hers first.""

And remember. Men shoulder almost the entirety of social pressure to approach and initiate. We're not given a manual on how to do this. So it's going to be awkward sometimes. Please don't hate us or shame us for that.

as a guy we don't get the luxury to wait on the sidelines for someone to approach us. For the most part girls will not initiate dates or ask us out or approach first

So if we don't want to be alone. we have to approach and initiate. And we have to do so right off the bat. Lest we be seen ""hiding our intentions""

That constant rejection shit grinds us down. And some guys don't react well after dealing with that. and lash out. And I'm sorry for that. But it's not like we want it to be this way.

In a more egalitarian society this imbalance wouldn't exist. Women wouldn't feel restrained for whatever reason to not openly express their interest and men wouldn't feel the constant need to always have this ""i have to impress the girl"" mode on.

I internalized this for years and it pushed me into a number of abusive and manipulative ""friendships"" with people who used me. Because all we're left with for ways to express interest is being nice or being deceptive.

(This probably wasn't the intended result, but I have never seen the people teaching these classes offer a disclaimer that men weren't the enemy or that male sexuality wasn't horrible, or that women weren't the victim.)

And I dealt with the results of internalizing that up until this right around this year. I watched everybody around me build families. Find love. Struggle through tough times with a partner to lean on. All the while I had nothing. Because nobody was expressing interest in me and I was terrified of doing so first. I struggled through poverty. Through mental health issues that nearly had me taking my own life.

I noticed something else. The friends I had, that were struggling like me, they had help. When one of my guy friends lost his job, his girlfriend and now wife took over while he was looking. When another friend was struggling to make ends meet while trying to go back to school to better themselves, her boyfriend worked so she could study. I had none of that because I was given the message that my desires and sexuality were disgusting and unwanted and I internalized it.

And who wouldn't internalize it in my shoes? These people were academic authorities, sounding so self-assured and believable, with scientific-sounding arguments and fire in their eyes.

Up until this year, I struggled with this issue until I finally snapped. I decided that I was going to stop caring about being a monster., I was going to find somebody online and just push my ""toxic desires"" onto them. I was going to pressure them with my predatory sexuality and stop giving a fuck about if they thought I was creepy. And so I did. And they reciprocated my interest. They WANTED my interest, they LIKED that I desired them sexually. We hooked up. And then we dated. It didn't last very long. But it still happened. And we're still friends.

And I'm not the only one who has noticed this. 

These are great reads on their own if you want. But I'll single out the most important bits for what I'm saying here.

https://theunitofcaring.tumblr.com/post/106549627991/that-scott-aaronson-thing

&gt;I‚Äôm a woman. I‚Äôm gay. By the time I realized that second thing, I‚Äôd internalized that all attraction to women was objectifying and therefore evil. I spent years of my life convinced that it was coercive to make it clear to girls that I wanted to date them, lest they feel pressured. So I could only ask them out with a clear conscience if I was in fact totally indifferent to their answer. I still decide I‚Äôm abusive pretty frequently, on the basis of things like ‚Äòi want to kiss her, which is what an abuser would want‚Äô and 'i want to be special to her, which is what an abuser would want‚Äô.

&gt;I internalized these messages from exposure to feminist memes, norms, and communities. It was feminist messages, not homophobic ones, that made it hardest for me to come to terms with my sexuality. It wasn‚Äôt intentional. But it happened. And it has happened by now to enough people that 'well obviously you‚Äôre misinterpreting it‚Äô is starting to wear thin as an excuse. Lots and lots of people are misinterpreting the way I did. By and large, we‚Äôre vulnerable people. Very often we‚Äôre mentally ill or disabled people.

https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=2091#comment-326664

&gt;Here‚Äôs the thing: I spent my formative years‚Äîbasically, from the age of 12 until my mid-20s‚Äîfeeling not ‚Äúentitled,‚Äù not ‚Äúprivileged,‚Äù but terrified. I was terrified that one of my female classmates would somehow find out that I sexually desired her, and that the instant she did, I would be scorned, laughed at, called a creep and a weirdo, maybe even expelled from school or sent to prison. And furthermore, that the people who did these things to me would somehow be morally right to do them‚Äîeven if I couldn‚Äôt understand how.

&gt;You can call that my personal psychological problem if you want, but it was strongly reinforced by everything I picked up from my environment: to take one example, the sexual-assault prevention workshops we had to attend regularly as undergrads, with their endless lists of all the forms of human interaction that ‚Äúmight be‚Äù sexual harassment or assault, and their refusal, ever, to specify anything that definitely wouldn‚Äôt be sexual harassment or assault. I left each of those workshops with enough fresh paranoia and self-hatred to last me through another year.

https://web.archive.org/web/20070917210115/http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2007/06/19/when-you-have-feminist-guilt-you-dont-need-catholic-guilt/

&gt;Feminism can exacerbate a man‚Äôs shyness, anxiety, self-consciousness, and guilt exactly because he is working very hard not to be sexist, and because he is sympathetic to feminism. Just as some workers, even conscientious ones, have trouble getting work done out of a perfectionistic fear of making mistakes, some men, even pro-feminist men or proto-feminist men, have trouble interacting with women out of a fear of making what feminism defines as mistakes (it doesn‚Äôt help that feminism‚Äôs criteria for acceptable behavior and so ambiguous and vague, and fail to clearly distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior, but that‚Äôs a whole different post).

And to sum them all up. A quote about all three. https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/

&gt;Scott Aaronson is a straight guy, and he‚Äôs saying feminist shaming tactics have made it worse. I‚Äôm an asexual heteroromantic guy, and I‚Äôm telling her feminist shaming tactics have made it worse. Unitofcaring is a lesbian woman, and she‚Äôs saying feminist shaming tactics have made it worse. HughRistik, who is some sort of weird metrosexual something (I mock him because I love him), is telling her feminist shaming tactics have made it worse. A giant cry has arisen from shy awkward men, lesbians, bisexuals, whatever of the world is saying ‚ÄúNO, SERIOUSLY, FEMINIST SHAMING TACTICS ARE MAKING THIS WORSE‚Äù

I heard that a reason why these gyms exist is because there are some women who are scared of being harassed by men. Honestly, I go to the YMCA (I'm a male), and I have female friends who go there too, and they tell me that they enjoy working out in a gender-neutral place, and that no guy has ever bugged them there. They also told me that they think the idea of female-only gyms is silly and very sexist. At the gym that I go at, nearly all guys (including me) don't go to there to hit on women. We only go there to get exercise, and most people (including me) usually mind our own business when excising and rarely talk to anyone there. I have actually never seen a guy hit on or bother a woman at the gym that I go to. That's the experience at my gym though, I can't say the same thing about other gyms. 

However, I never understand female-only gyms.  If women feel embarrassed going to the gym, then they shouldn't go to the gym, do it at home, or run in the park, instead of discriminating against men by labelling them all sex perverts that only go to gyms to hit on women, how absurd. The very same bullshit could apply to straight men, they could claim they feel embarrassed when gay men look at them, but could you imagine the uproar if they had straight-only times in the gym? 

If feminists actually do want equal rights, they can't have stuff like female-only gyms. Places like those are flat-out discriminating against a certain group of people.",1.0,1.0,1.0,34.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jzb80q/whats_your_opinion_on_femaleonly_gyms/,AncientBodybuilder

Unfortunately I wasn‚Äôt as lucky as nowhere as many resources were available to me. That needs to change‚Äù.

A nice opportunity to show some underlying sexism in the court system) I brought up how a woman could call false rape accusations on a man and most likely win, and my (female) looked me in the eyes and sternly said ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go there‚Äù. Okay, sure. THEN WHY WAS THE SUBJECT WE DID ASKING IF IT WAS EASIER TO BE A MAN OR A WOMAN IN THIS (first) WORLD. I was the only one who said it was easier to be a woman in this day and age, and barely by much. I gave my reasons (which I‚Äôm sure you all know off by heart by now) and then the opposition spoke up, gave their points with no evidence, and it was declared they won. 

I brought up these issues many times to many teachers, and they‚Äôve never really given their stance (besides my humanities teacher). With the default mindset being feminists are right, this war will never be won. This counterintuitive loop will most likely never be broken. I once had a mental breakdown about this. It‚Äôs not fun, fingers al tingly, heavy breathing, lots of crying and even more shouting. Please guys, I really need some encouraging words, but even more some hope.",1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jzdeqw/the_fight_will_never_be_done_brothers/,Stray_48

2020-11-23 22:13:10,I wish I was not circumcised,"As the title says. Like many men, I was cut as a baby. Nobody told me about it, so I found out by accident when I started watching porn later in my teens. I had heard a bit about the procedure prior, but without knowing what a foreskin actually was, I wasn't actually sure about my circumcision status until I saw an actual foreskin. Without knowing anything about what a foreskin did, I felt disgusted, violated, and angry. As I did more research, I felt very sad I will never be able to experience sex as an intact man, that I would have sensations and function missing for the entirety of my life. There are a lot of emotions to unpack, but there is envy, anger, depression, despair, dysphoria, and a profound sense of loss among other negative emotions I feel on a semi regular basis.

I talked to my parents about it, and I cannot be angry at them. Hell, my dad was cut and both my parents agreed to the procedure because it was supposed to be beneficial. The doctors words were apparently ""I would do it to my son"". We cut most boys when they are born so it feels like having a problem with being cut is going against our culture. Many people will not listen to you if you complain about it, as if one should be happy they had a piece of their genitals cut off and destroyed. It is very disheartening. Combined with the fact that the procedure is irreversible, I feel disgusting.

Personally, I was cut very tight. I had to be very delicate down there else I get a tear. Abrasions were also very common. On top of this, I am fairly numb in the whole area, so I feel nothing from many sexual acts. I was surprised the first time I had oral as I was totally underwhelmed. Sex feels ok, but is not stellar, and I have the stereotypical problem of needing to jackhammer to get off. I have also discovered that lube is necessary for me to have sex as I have had painful experiences for myself and my partners because of chafing; an intact penis actually contributes to lubrication during sex (and masturbation). I masturbated much later than my peers because nothing felt very good when I touched my penis; I just had an awkward, frustrating boner I couldn't do anything with. When I finally figured it out, I routinely tore my skin and gave myself abrasions unless I used lube. I learned later this was not normal.

I know society is slowly changing it's view on the procedure, but I feel left by the wayside. This is something that really is not taken seriously by our culture at large; in fact, it's a joke to many. Even if it was taken seriously, it is too late for myself and many others. It hurts. Many people will probably accuse me of finding a weird hill to die on. To be fair, there is more to life than just sex, but it feels very unfair to be mutilated then expected to be even grateful for it when much of the world is able to live in their intact bodies.",1.0,1.0,1.0,182.0,/r/MensRights/comments/jziawe/i_wish_i_was_not_circumcised/,Shoemethemonkey

2020-11-25 00:14:41,What to Do When You May Be a Victim of DV,"#Introduction
Domestic Violence (DV) is commonly assumed to have a single perpetrator and a single victim; thanks to the misogynistic Duluth model, *men* have faced injustices in this area for decades. This is despite hard evidence that women are *more likely than men* to be physically *AND* emotionally coercive in single-perpetrator relationships where DV occurs. Men face difficult challenges in getting support, whether it is from DV shelters, friends, family, or even law enforcement.

These injustices are not going to be remedied any time soon.

So that means we must find ways to mitigate our risks, because we are *guilty until proven innocent* in this area of the law. We must be educated on matters pertaining to DV so we can proactively avoid relationships that present a DV risk, we must know what our tools are and have a plan in order to survive and not get destroyed by the system.

#Part 1- Knowledge and Networking
There is no substitute for knowing your local laws, the social and cultural standards of your area pertaining to DV, and the severity with which perpetrators are handled. Many resources are generally available, and they should inform your plans, as the severity of the risk is greatly influenced by these conditions.

""Rub elbows"" with people on law enforcement, become acquaintances with a variety of professionals, doctors, lawyers, security specialists, financial experts. Get to know them, get to know their positions on DV and men's rights- so you can know who to trust. Because if the shit hits the fan, you'll need help, and they can help you if you've been good to them.

You will also need to learn a few surveillance and electronic skills, to install audio and video surveillance, as well as critical thinking and planning skills required to give yourself a safety net.

#Part 2- The Safety Net
You will need a few things in order to be able to take action in the event of DV.
1. Cash and Identification
2. Transportation
3. Communications
4. Basic necessities for at least three days
5. Shelter
6. Evidence

These things are non-negotiable. How you obtain each one will vary, and the degree to which you perform will be essential. Many abusers constrain their victims in many ways, limiting contact, limiting finances, preventing access to a vehicle, and more. This pattern creates a form of traumatic passivity, where one normalizes the abuse and develops a *""trauma bond,""* where the victim accepts abuse in exchange for positive experience. If you are making an *excuse* for your abuser, you need help desperately because, chances are, *you will be unable to make effective and healthy choices pertaining to your abuser and will be unable to successfully escape until you are irrevocably harmed.""

Cash and ID- You need a safe-deposit box with negotiable items like Traveler's Cheques, Prepaid Visa/MasterCard/Other gift cards, some cash, and ideally a form of identification like a passport. You will need a safe place to hide additional identification so you can obtain these things at the bank. (Yes that's *three* (3) forms of *PRIMARY* identification (ask your financial expert what that is if you need help).) Without these things, you may be unable to successfully escape. A credit card in your name with no paper billing might be good to stash in your safe box.

Transportation- You need access to *ANY* form of transportation, vehicle or bicycle, and the means to secure it. If that's leaving a bike at a neighbor's house down the street, chained in their side yard, leaving a copy of car keys somewhere only you know,  etc. You need to be able to evacuate.

Communications- Abusers love to prevent communication about their actions with the outside. You will need a prepaid phone in the event your abuser destroys your phone. A hidden pre-paid phone card and knowledge of the nearest pay-phone (rare these days) can work. You will also need a P.O. Box (or it's equivalent) so you can get mail securely. Save the spare key in your Safe Deposit box.

Basic Necessities- Toiletries, Medication, Work Clothes, socks/underwear. Keep this bag prepped and ready. You'll need at least two sets of clothing, three pairs of under garments, and medication for at least two weeks. This ensures you can continue to work, even if you have to do laundry at a laundromat every other day.

Shelter- Any cheap motel will do for the first night. After that, you need to find an apartment or AirB'n'B that can shit your needs *inexpensively*. Look around and find places beforehand. Knowledge is everything.

Evidence- This is the hardest. Record *everything* on your phone, and store it in the cloud. Ensure your phone is password-protected, and never share it. Ever. EVER DO YOU HEAR? Document the events that occur with your trusted physician, therapist (if you have one), a psychiatrist (if you have one), write down everything she said or did to you, and sign and date it immediately, and mail it to your P.O. Box. Do not hesitate, but it will stay safe there, and the time stamp on the envelope will prove when it was sent. You can also (SECRETLY) set up surveillance in your home to record all incidents of abuse.

If you are currently in an abusive situation, do everything within your power to obtain the following: A safe-deposit box, a P.O. Box, cash and basic necessities, an additional ID, and a prepaid phone. A cheap (but functional) bicycle on Craigslist can help.

#Part 3 - Leaving
First Hours- Gather *EVERYTHING* you need and leave immediately. You will be afraid, but you have everything you need. If you have your phone, factory reset the device, and contact everyone that needs contacting. If you have a vehicle, drive to the P.O. Box and get your records, and then to the Bank and store the evidence there. Get your negotiables, ID if you need it, and anything else. Go to the store and obtain your basic necessities. Check in to a Motel and start formulating your long-term plan. Change ALL of your passwords **immediately.**

Do not contact *ANY* of her friends, her family members, where she works, nothing.

First Day- Take the day off if you can.  get your documentation and evidence, and head down to the courthouse and file a restraining order *immediately*. Do not hesitate. If you need assistance, contact an Attorney that specializes in DV, and preferably is one you are familiar with. You may consider doing this ahead of time if you have consistent, uncontestable proof of her wrongdoing in order to build an MO. You can even make the report at a police substation in order to build what you need. (Keep in mind, she will need to be served in order for the restraining order to be enforceable.)

Go to your bank, if you have a joint bank account with your abuser, withdraw everything in it and close the account. Go to a different bank, and open a new bank account. Ensure the address for mail is sent to your P.O. Box. Keep some cash on hand until you receive the debit card and/or checks in your P.O. Box. Transfer your direct deposit (if you have one) to your new bank account. The earlier this is done, the better.

Get a new phone number and new device if you need it.

First Week- Secure a means transportation. Consult with your attorney about your next steps.

Consideration-Children: Take them with you at first. You will need additional funding and planning to accommodate them, but leaving them in the hands of your abuser will inevitably result in parental alienation. Discuss with your attorney if they have been abused, or whether you should contact social services. Pack everything you need for them, so they can continue their schooling and be taken care of. PLAN PLAN PLAN. You may consider contacting the authorities and file a report about the abuse and the abuse of your children. Understand what the ramifications of that are.

Consideration-Married: Not much different, except you should fill out the divorce documents as you want them (consult your attorney if necessary) and make copies. Have your attorney deliver them. If you have kids it gets complicated, and fast.

#Conclusion
You know what your risks and fears are better than anyone else. Take the steps you need in order to secure your basic needs, and then execute upon it without mercy. The world is vicious and treats men mercilessly, so you must plan and act as if you were alone. Take time to ensure your plan is well thought out.

Pay attention to red-flags that indicate abusive behavior:

Extreme jealousy: Accusations of cheating, asking for passwords to your phone or Email, anger at normal conversations with other women, threatens to leave if you don't stop talking to your friends, etc.

Emotional manipulation: attempts at making you feel guilty for not doing what she wants, gaslighting, threats, however subtle, etc.

Financial coercion: Requests to deposit your checks into her account, anger at not paying for things she wants, dismisses gifts because they ""weren't good enough,"" fraudulent activity on your accounts initiated by her, etc.

Physical violence of any kind (non-consenting): slapping, punching, kicking, especially if made in anger.

Sexual violence of any kind: Damage to genitalia, use of sex to coerce behavior, sexual assault or rape.

2020-11-25 08:33:19,"I took off from work today and turned into a ""house husband"". And I would switch roles permanently if I could.","I wasn't planning on doing anything in particular today. I just wanted a day off and figured that around the holidays was a good time to do that.

What I ended up doing was cleaning the house though.  Top to bottom with chemicals - bleach, floor shine, windex, counter cleaner...  There's not an inch of this house that I didn't touch today.  

I also cooked.  All three meals for me, my girlfriend (who works from home), and our kids.

And you know what I realized?

I would do the same thing every single day of my life if it meant I'd never have to work again. No more commuting.  No more worrying about money, fighting for promotions, stress about layoffs, or having to kiss ass every day.

Now I'm not saying it was easy.  In fact I think I'm about as tired as I would be coming home from work.  But I'm strangely energized if that makes sense.  I just feel better.  (Plus, for the sake of argument, you don't do cleaning like that every day).

Anyway my point is that men definitely get the short end of the stick with this work vs cleaning stuff.  It's completely unfair. Not just because women get the better end of the deal. But also because society won't admit to this and instead looks down on men and the work we typically do for the family.

If women don't want to do housework then that's fine.  Get a job.  A real job that requires real work and pays enough to cover the bills and not just your spending money.  And then leave me home.  I'll make that sacrifice.  I'll take a bullet for the team.  And you'd better be appreciative of me even if I don't appreciate you going to work and paying the bills.  And when you get home, I get to boss you around and make you do whatever housework I decided I didn't want to do that day.  Not to mention the yard work, running errands on the way home, fixing things, and everything else that doesn't entail ""cooking and cleaning"".

Because that's the world that men live in.  And it sucks.  It's not a privilege to leave your house and work all day only to get nagged and hassled when you get home.  It's not a privilege to bust your butt every single day but have all of that ignored because your wife or girlfriend cleaned that day and is ""tired"".

Granted me and my girlfriend both work and we both regularly split chores.  Not a whole lot of people live in traditionalist households anymore.  But a lot of couples tend to split their responsibilities in that direction. With men working more (or at harder jobs) and women cleaning more.  

I'd definitely do it though. So long as I was the one who got to stay home.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MensRights/comments/k0hguo/i_took_off_from_work_today_and_turned_into_a/,Oncefa2

2020-11-25 13:57:36,Equality of norms for achievement: What happens if men's norms don't keep up?,"We hear about how women make [better political leaders](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/05/perspectives/women-leaders-coronavirus/index.html), how [textbooks](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-8979111/One-UKs-biggest-school-textbook-makers-vows-flip-harmful-gender-stereotypes.html) will intentionally work to create norms of more women than men in socially desirable positions and we see [attacks on men](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/21/intel-ceo-brian-krzanich-to-step-down-bob-swan-to-step-in-as-interim-ceo.html) in those positions.

To  some extent, I think norms in the past have not supported women's  achievement and advocacy for equality is valuable. However, I don't see  feminism stopping at equality. It seems to me they are pushing men down  as they raise women up and, to me, it looks like a push for power and  domination, not equality.

In terms  of what creates power, there are a lot of different theories, but in  general I'd argue money is important. Weber's theory suggests its [closely related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-component_theory_of_stratification)  to influence and it makes sense logically. It can buy you exposure,  help recruit talented people and influence what actions people choose to  take. Couple that with the fact that people [support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism) others in their in-group and money becomes a tool of social influence to support groups those who earn it are part of.

Whether people choose to earn money often comes down to norms. They're extremely powerful at directing action, and [Stanford](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-norms/)  says they're a viable alternative to written laws. Women already have  norms in favor of working and achievement through feminism. Men's norms  still seem to be up in the air.

Unless  we expect feminists to genuinely care about our needs and we want to  give up direction over how our lives go, I think it is essential men  maintain norms for achievement that match the norms for women advocated  by feminism.",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/k0mejt/equality_of_norms_for_achievement_what_happens_if/,smeltaway

2020-11-26 01:47:21,disturbing slogan in feminism,"Have any of you guys encountered the slogan ""k1ll all men"" from feminists?  I've seen it from time to time and I find it disturbing to say the least.  To be fair, I can say I saw some feminists arguing against its use, but others seem perfectly okay with it.  Supposedly, it's some kind of joke, but I don't find it very funny.  It makes me wonder if I'll end up having to defend my life against a deranged woman who thinks assaulting or even murdering a man is somehow patriotic. Sounds like terrorism to me.  Some women do murder men.  Jodi Arias got her ex boyfriend all naked and vulnerable in the shower and then stabbed him to death.  

When someone makes some kind of violent statement and acts like it's just a funny joke, that's something to take seriously, IMO.  RooshV made his absurd statement about making rape legal as long as it's on private property.  When people were outraged, he backtracked, claiming it was just satire.  I know what's funny, and that wasn't funny.  Neither is the ""k1ll all men"" thing.  I had hoped for universal condemnation of that slogan by feminists, but that does not appear to be the case.  Some of them appear to think that's funny.  That gives me great concern that I'll end up being forced to defend my life against a deranged sicko.  

I'm wondering about other people's reaction to this.  Does that slogan bother you as well?",1.0,1.0,1.0,37.0,/r/MensRights/comments/k0wwda/disturbing_slogan_in_feminism/,TigPlaze

2020-11-26 04:30:24,"Something is rotten in the men of Denmark? According to ""Violence against women - an EU-wide survey"" Danish men are the most violent, then come other countries that have been ranked the most equal by the EU. Hmm...","TLDR: the last couple of paragraphs try to say something about why ""more equal"" countries are ""more violent"". What are your thoughts?

The survey found that 31% of women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15. For Danish women the share was 52%. Other Nordic countries were not far behind: Finland 47% and Sweden 46%.  (p. 28) Fourth was the Netherlands - and thus we have the most equal countries (according to the EU) being the most violent against women!

I can't say I know exactly what's going on, so, here are just some observations I made while skimming through the ""Main Findings"" (see the link at the end).  

First, there are categories of violence that aren't necessarily violence at all. They include  pushing or shoving, slapping or grabbing, or pulling a woman‚Äôs hair. The most common form of violence is pushing (and shoving). It has happened to 74% of all victims (in the EU since the age of 15). I can't find any figure directly indicating how many women have only been pushed. That would be an interesting number when deciding whether the EU - or Denmark - is having a violence or pushing crisis. The report has this to say:

&gt; Removing the most common experience of being ‚Äòpushed‚Äô or ‚Äòshoved‚Äô from the overall count of women‚Äôs experience of violence lowers the prevalence rate for violence only to 25 % [from 31%] in the past 12 months (see Table 2.6). This indicates that women experience a range of severe forms of violence in their lifetime.

I assume that instead of 12 months they are talking about ""since 15"" because 8% can't ""lower to 25%"" but 31% can. If so, this means that about 20% of those who have been pushed have only been pushed. How any of this would indicate that ""women experience a range of severe forms of violence in their lifetime"" is totally beyond me. Probably they're they just make things up. 

There seems to be no similar information about the other categories that aren't necessarily ""actual"" violence like ""grabbing"" or ""hard object thrown at them"". So, unfortunately, I have no idea how common is actual violence, the kind of violence we think when we think about violence. But we can say that it must be much lower than the 31% share activists - like the EU officials - use. Probably well below 20% even by their own criteria. 

Furthermore, it's not only men who push and grab women. Other women do it, too:

&gt;  ...the majority of physical violence against women is also gender-based. However, one in four incidents (26 %) of non-partner physical violence is carried out by a female perpetrator...

Because the whole idea of the survey is to ""prove"" that violence against women by men is rampant this, too, weakens their feminist argument.  By the way, women like grab and pull hair more than men who, for their part, are more into pushing and shoving.

There is more to marvel in the methodology and the strange ""lapses"" but let's move on. The feminists who fabric ... wrote conducted the study must have found it frustrating that the countries they have ranked the most equal are the most violent. So, the report has an unusual self-reflection part - unusual for a feminist paper, that is. Had the violent countries been places like Romania or Bulgaria, which are ranked the least equal, that part would not have been necessary, I believe.

Here are the explanations that, how should I put it, are not too vague or stupid to be worth considering. In the more equal countries 

* people talk about private matters, such as VAW (violence against women) more openly (sounds reasonable but I don't know if it's true), 
* VAW is talked in media and women are encouraged to talk about it (certainly true),
* women go out more boldly, work in hazardous occupations etc (perhaps), 
* there is more violence in general (I don't think so) and 
* there is more binge drinking (true, I guess).

(See pp. 22- for ""Possible explanations for differences"" in the report.)

Anyway, I don't think they can really say anything meaningful because they are feminists and have decided beforehand what they want to say. And that is: violence is something men do a lot to women. Their whole worldview is based on this so that's what they'll say never mind what. 

But if you drop those premises, well, here's my take, for what it's worth. In addition to some of the sensible reasons above, in places like Denmark men and women are equal in the sense that men often treat women the same way they treat other men. Women don't get the same ""safety privileges"" they get in ""less equal"" countries. Women get pushed and shoved. Likewise, women can express their anger the same way. But when men -  and women - push or grab women - or men - it's not typically violence at all, contrary to what the men-hating faction wants to believe. 

Then there is jealousy. Perhaps in more ""equal"" countries the possibility of cheating increases. Perhaps people more often have disagreements who should be with whom tonight. People spend, after all, time in places where both sexes are present and sexual mores are lax. 

By the way, I'm not from Denmark but Finland, ""the second most dangerous place for women in Europe"" as the local feminists, media, politicians etc want to remind us.

2020-11-26 10:39:38,Poland's Next Top Model bans male contestant for reported sex conviction abroad,"Hi everyone,

I just wanted to give you all a heads-up on something that's been happening in my native country relevant to Men's Rights that most MRAs in the U.S. and other countries have likely not heard of.

Dominic D'Angelica is a 30 year old African-American man who was a contestant on the 9th edition of Poland's Top Model competition (unlike in some countries, in the Polish version of the show both men and women can participate in the same category). As the season progressed, Dominic remained one of the most popular contestants and made it to the final episode, where he was tipped by some to win. However, the day before the final aired he was abruptly disqualified, and the show was ultimately won by Miko≈Çaj, the other remaining male contestant.

Talk began to spread on the Internet that Dominic had previously been convicted of having oral sex with a minor while in the United States. The alleged offence supposedly took place in 2011, when Dominic was 22 and involved a 15-year-old female complainant. Dominic was subsequently arrested and pled no contest, since he didn't have enough money to pay his attorney (I found this on his Instagram page). While the exact details vary depending on the source, it appears he was sentenced to 60 days in a California jail, followed by 3 years' probation and mandatory registration on California's sex offender registry. He was later arrested again and served additional time in jail for violating the terms of those probation, which in any case did not involve a sexual component. In fact, according to Dominic this second run-in involved a common assault conviction for protecting his aunt from an abusive boyfriend. He also claims he never spent any jail time for the original conviction. Again, details are sketchy but if he did serve any time it was minimal (a few months).

Here are some of the elements of the whole story, and Dominic's disqualification I find particularly disturbing.

--**The offence Dominic committed would not be considered a criminal offence in Poland.**

This cannot be underlined enough. As is widely known, each country has its own age of consent and there is no universal agreement as to when one is old enough to consent to sexual acts. California's age of consent is 18; in Poland the age is 15, after which any relationship between two consenting individuals is entirely legal. **If the offence had taken place in Poland, it would have been considered entirely legal, and there would be no possibility of criminal prosecution.** However, despite this fact, the show's producers completely ignored this circumstance in their decision to disqualify Dominic from the show.

--Dominic had served his entire sentence, and therefore since the legal system had decided he had made amends for his crime, it should not continue to impact his personal life. Dominic may still have been a registered sex offender under California law but as far as I know, in no way did this prohibit him from taking part in a beauty pageant, game show or other competition, even in his home state let alone abroad. It doesn't appear he was under any restrictions in Poland given that his past legal problems only came to light immediately before the final episode. Dominic's disqualification reflects cancel culture at its finest. Like we've seen in previous instances, a person is turned into an outcast for a single incident of misbehavior, often dating back many years with complete disregard for his later behaviour and minimal, if any, chance of rehabilitating his reputation.

--The violation of privacy is also egregious. Here's a contestant who was found guilty, years ago, of an offence in another country (which would not even be an offence in the current country, I do not think this can be overstated), yet his past was still uncovered and came back to haunt him and essentially ruin his career prospects. It remains to be seen if Dominic will take legal action against the producers, but if he cannot find a way to win damages, his career is likely over. The bottom line is that in today's online globalized world, there is no escape. **If you committed, or even are alleged to have committed, anything in contrary to the dominant social zeitgeist, there is no refuge for you. There is no refuge in time, and now there is no refuge in space either. Even if the dispute happened halfway around the world a decade ago, if someone is hell-bent on destroying you, they likely will, and short of moving to some secluded village in a developing country, everyone will find out. You can no longer bury your past or hide it from anyone, even on the other side of the planet. The days of being able to start over, are over.**

--Which brings me to my next point, which is that the story seems to have been brought forward by the complainant and her team. While she may have been a minor at the time of their relationship, she is now an adult who knows that she is trying to destroy a man's life yet there is no accountability on her part. The media have not even released her name, etc., and it is unlikely that anyone in her social circle, like her employer, will ever find out about her actions. This despite the fact that she is clearly a liability to any company she works for, as her actions clearly demonstrate a vindictive attitude, an astute willingness to go the extra mile to engage in vengeful actions to destroy the life of someone whom she perceives to have wronged her, yet in the eyes of the media and the general politically correct social establishment, she is completely innocent and spotless and should not bear any social responsibility for her actions, while the reputation of the man who allegedly wronged her should be irreversibly tarnished, possibly forever. As is often the case with feminism, the double standard are appalling.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensRights/comments/k16pki/polands_next_top_model_bans_male_contestant_for/,shydude92

It‚Äôs the difference between grade results when gender bias is removed (for the most part).

‚ÄúIn contrast, ACT test scores are a point-in-time estimate of academic achievement. Because the ACT excludes items that might create a gender bias, it provides an objective, summative measure of student learning.‚Äù

In short, when boys are graded outside of the context of gender, and most likely when they study outside of the context of feminist teachers, they start to excel.  

Recognizing this is critical in getting these boys a higher education instead of watching them drop out and give up.",1.0,1.0,1.0,12.0,/r/MensRights/comments/k1ejl7/gender_bias_in_high_school_grading/,Suck-Less

2020-11-26 21:54:49,"Male Reproduction Rights receive a little attention, even if hostile.","Just wanted to let this subreddit know of this interactions of Matt Dillahunty regarding Male Reproduction Rights.

[This is the video](https://youtu.be/QG3hyaLxdVw) that started it. Matt is very hostile to Tyler at the start. In the end he calms down but the conversation already derailed and not much could be discussed about the original topic.

Later Matt uploaded [another video](https://youtu.be/QBAt0Dx0rrA) with further thoughts about Male Reproduction Rights. In this video and its comments he goes further with the ad hominens. Calling deadbeat dads to those that suggest the responsibility that falls onto the future father is greater than it should and suggesting that those who fear accidentally making a woman pregnant (and thus be trapped into parenthood) are ""not a big of a catch"". Also calling people ""idiot"" left and right.

Besides those two videos I want to include two other things that could be useful during discourse.

* Matt makes the argument ""consent to sex is not consent to pregnancy"" several times in those videos. But in the past he has made the argument ""consent to sex is consent to pregnancy"" [here](https://youtu.be/P78_V1Z9CO4?t=3627). Bear in mind that video is from 2012. I presented that video to him and has not made a comment about it yet.
* I want to bring [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Rtonpmb1Db0dJ7hhkSGK-99YkOKAbm3FGQR_-sf2esE/edit?usp=sharing) to the discussion.

In short, recently two topics have been pushed a lot by my uni's social committee: women and racism. Men's international day was a few days ago and we had no single mention about it, no mention about depression which in my country is a huge issue (depression in general, but men statistically are the most affected gender). 

I have no issues if they want to talk about domestic violence, it is an issue. But why are they limiting the topic to WOMEN ONLY? In here it is very common for women to be bossy at home and to complain about everything their husbands do, leading to big arguments. Why can't I talk about it being a way of psychological domestic violence that leads to the depression issue I've mentioned above?

For a while I've been here, I've never felt privileged for being a man (in some situations it was rather the opposite) so the 1st time I had a conversation with a feminist I got so pissed at her arguments that I ended up finding this and enjoying the content. However, most of the news shared here is from the US, in Portugal we don't have the same unfair alimony laws and child custody fights depend a lot on the kid's wishes, I've always thought things in my country would never get to the toxic extreme you guys have in there. Stuff like this e-mail makes me realize we are just behind the clock a bit, it's a matter of time.

2020-11-27 02:16:11,"MOTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. MY SON IS LOSING HER, IS ONE HEALTHY FATHER ENOUGH!? HER LAWYER BELIEVES NOT"," MOTHER MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. IS ONE HEALTHY FATHER ENOUGH!? shr has rich parents and their lawyer team has been giving me hell for the last year! While she destroys her life, the lawyers destroy mine and our son's!!

 My 3-year-old son has not seen his mother in 3 months! He had supervised visits with her, on and off, one day a week since her D.V. arrest in 2019. She was also arrested in April for possession and DUID. She has serious suicidal thoughts; she has had distant past and recent 5150/5250s.

She's been diagnosed with many mental health conditions, including bilolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder,  Disassociative diso,rder and more.

 This August she possibly tried to poison him at a visit. The visitation monitor took them to the hospital and she tried to feed him the stuff again, and caused a been scene. She then got irate and violent with hospital staff and security in front of him. She had police and DCFS called on her.

 Just before our forced separation sep 2019 she told me she was having thoughts of harming him. I read, last month she told a detective that she had had thoughts of harming herself and our son; she also blamed the thoughts on witchcraft. She also has given different reasons for why she fed our son bathtub soap. My wifes biological mother was schizophrenic and I fear she may be, at 29, a late onset case.  

The Los Angeles courts are very slow during the covid-19 limitations, also her wealthy parents pay a lawyer team to complicate the process and miscronstrude facts, and block her medical records from being subpoenaed so far. It feels like the lawyers and the court do have our sons best interest as priority.

 After I filled a restraining order to protect him in aug, I offered her Zoom video visits last week, but she did not exept the conditions. 

 Our son does not seem to be effected by this at all, some times he asks for her. I wish he could see her, but I also don't want to risk his life. It's hard to know what her intention was in feeding him stuff that wasn't food 2 times in a row.

He is a very happy 3 year old, social and smart. I spend everyday with him when he's not at school, but I fear that not seeing his mother will traumatize him. It is really weighing on me to make the right decisions. Can you make suggestions on what to do? 
What do I tell him when he asks to see his mom? 
Can I see a psychologist to inform me on how to parent him and help me make visitation decisions?
And how likely is it that his mother was trying to harm him by what she did and if not, then why would she feed him bathtub fizz dye once and then try again in the hospital?",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensRights/comments/k1kc56/mother_mental_health_issues_my_son_is_losing_her/,ClayDePerna

&amp;#x200B;

 **""Ya'll bouta get real mad at me for this one... Women have a higher and stronger immune system and recover from diseases/illness, etc. than men do. (1 point for women) Who is smarter? women, actually. (1 point for women) who has a larger muscle mass and is physically stronger? Men. (1 point for men) Who was given the fantasy that they're superior and now have an advantage over women because of it and caused us to now decide if genders are equal?  Men. (1 point) Total: Women (2 points) Men (2 points) They're Equal.**  

**Now getting into who has it harder.  Period cramps and pains are equal to the pain of a heart attack and possibly giving birth. Women go through it every month for 5+ days and have the ability to completely cover up the pain in public areas. Men can't do that. Women are body shamed and told how they should look almost on a daily basis. They are pressured into doing things that they do not want to do. If they are assaulted or raped, they are told things like ""you probably enjoyed it"" or ""What were you wearing? You were asking for it"" If I go out into public confidently wearing a crop top and shorts, I am not doing it to be raped or pressured into sexual activities. I am doing it because I am confident in my body.  I understand that you can think what you want, but if you behave and act on a woman because you can't control your body, then you obviously you should not be out in public.**  

**However, sadly there are women that use their advantage over men in an irresponsible way by accusing men of rape or assault, and then the woman is automatically believed. And by the time they are proven innocent, the damage is already done.**   

**So, in my opinion and many others opinion, they are somewhat equal.""**

&amp;#x200B;

I hate it when some people think one gender is better than the other. I also hate it when some people think one gender is smarter than the other. Judging someone by their gender is sexist and stupid.
