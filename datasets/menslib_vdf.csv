2020-08-01 02:26:48,"Hey r/Menslib, what’s your experience with not wanting children?","A female friend of mine recently got the Ol’ Snip, and it has got me thinking over the past few days. Prior to her surgery, she had shared that she made this whole damn binder in order to try and convince doctors to sign off and let her get her tubes tided or however they’re doing it. 

Obviously, that’s insane. Nobody should have to write an essay on why they want a certain procedure done.

And there’s been varying reactions to her decision from her social circles. Most of our friends tend to be pretty progressive so her personal decisions don’t really matter to most, but there’s been the occasional person asking “Do you think you’ll regret it?”, etc, etc.

And so it got me thinking: what’re your experiences with not having children? Either socially or medically? How do you think men are seen in the context of fatherhood today, do you think there’s some coded “manliness” to being a father? 

I myself am an early twenties dude with no expectations or desires for children anytime soon, and I’ve noticed that a helluva lot of people don’t pay that a second thought. But around my age, though it’s not that more, there seems to be slightly more people asking my female friends if they’re sure about not having children soon, what about their biological clock, and so on.

So Menslib, what’re your thoughts and experiences?",1.0,1.0,1.0,39.0,/r/MensLib/comments/i1cqcd/hey_rmenslib_whats_your_experience_with_not/,mandolin6648

2020-08-02 03:20:22,Happy Birthday /r/MensLib,"Today, /r/MensLib turns 5! It's been five years since we promoted the sub by PMing users personally and got excited when a post got over 100 upvotes. It's safe to say it's time to let our hair down a little bit and have a chat about where the sub is now and where it's going. Ask us mods your questions and raise any concerns you might have. Obviously the ""no meta complaints"" rule is suspended for this thread, although, you know, still be nice!

I also have something to ask of the community. Since, the sub is at 130,000 subscribers now (give or take) we can no longer read every single comment that gets posted and don't always know about every discussion that's taking place on the sub. Some people have complained to us about seeing sexist comments stay up without being removed for a long time - chance are, if you see a comment like that, nobody has told us about it yet. We're counting on all of you to use the report button and modmail us if something doesn't look right. Thank you.",1.0,1.0,1.0,90.0,/r/MensLib/comments/i1xvxy/happy_birthday_rmenslib/,delta_baryon
2020-08-02 04:23:00,Society's perception of male kindness,"So I stumbled upon [this picture](https://i.redd.it/z6ljn504oce51.jpg) that had been posted somewhere else on reddit and then visited the comments section. Pretty much every single comment on it was how the boy in the picture was a 'simp' or how he did it 'for the pussy'. I was appalled, not only because of the comments, but because I realized how I had thought the same for a moment.

I realized men are always viewed as sexhungry animals first and humans capable of kindness, platonic relationships and empathy second. The indoctrination is so strong that even myself, a person that considers himself to be both a feminist and a mens liberation advocate, thought the same at first.

2020-08-02 09:06:20,"Standardized, widespread consent workshops, how valuable would they be?","So thinking on a few threads in this sub that touched on consent, one topic that came up a few time is the concept of consent workshops.  These are more prevelant in specific communities like the poly and bdsm communities, but I wonder if they might have a lot of value if they were a widespread and normalized phenomenon.  Perhaps if they became big enough completing a workshop would alloow you to attach a completion badge to an online dating profile.   To be more specific, the type of workshop i am referring to will have specific discussions on what consent is an isn't, provide rules for requesting consent and ways to eitehr accept or refuse consent, and involve practical exercises where people practice both asking for consent, giving or refusing consent, and corresponding appropriately to refusal.  These workshops are often mixed gender and the concept of consent is presented in a gender neutral way, not because there isn't a gender imbalance in sexual assault but because the rules do apply to everyone.  These workshops have maximum value when both potential romantic partners have taken the same course.

The potential benefits seem to be 

1. makes it harder to claim ""miscommunication"" - people who commit sexual assault often use miscommunication as an excuse.  While this shouldn't ever be acceptable, having a specific set of rules sepcified in advance makes it much harder to get away with this excuse.
2. creates less awkwardness around asking for consent - people who do care about consent nonetheless often find asking for explicit verbal consent to be awkward.  If certain methods are covered in the course and specified as normal, and you know your partner has covered the same course, it becomes less awkward
3. creates less awkwardness around refusing consent - people sometimes feel awkward saying no.  knowing that both you and your partner have attended the same workshop on refusing consent can reduce that awkwardness
4. makes further conversations about consent easier - obviously the workshop can't cover everything but because it creates a common baseline and a standard set of experiences, it makes further conversations easier.  Bringing up consent out of the blue can be awkward sometimes but it is much more natural to say ""hey you know how at that workshop they said xyz?""

Potential drawbacks

1. Creating a false sense of security - obviously no workshop can cure bad intentions, so predatory people can take this class in order to obtain the credential and lull others into a false sense of security.
2. Teaching predators how to talk the talk - people intent on doing wrong might be able to use the language taught at the consent workshops to present themselves as concerned about consent and cast doubt on allegations against them.
3. Using the workshops rules as a checklist - bad actors might not break the rules, but rather follow the letter of the law while doing everything possible within those rules to create a high pressure environment and get to a yes
4. the workshop's discussions on refusing consent could be used against victims - While obviously workshops should never suggest that there is only one right way to refuse consent, it will have to cover specific examples, and someone refusing consent in a way not covered could be used in bad faith as an excuse to ignore the refusal.

Anyway,, what do people think of this concept? have people been to workshops like this? would you go to one if it became a thing? what are the realistic chances they could become a widespread phenomenon? are there other benefits/problems I have not listed?",1.0,1.0,1.0,46.0,/r/MensLib/comments/i23irr/standardized_widespread_consent_workshops_how/,Jon_S111
2020-08-02 11:22:14,"Talking through our dating insecurities, starting with mine","So obviously modern dating is kinda a mind field and I have started a couple of threads about them here in the last couple of days. I also have seen a couple of people bring up their own particular insecurities and saw that a lot of the follow up conversation was valuable. So I thought it might be useful to start up a thread devoted to open discussion of these insecurities.  And to get the ball rolling I will start with mine.  By way of background I am a straight cis guy, but of course this thread is meant for anyone and everyone who wants to discuss this topic.

But as for my biggest insecurity - i notice i tend to very often feel a lot of anxiety on dates if my date and I have not yet kissed for the first time.  This doesn't always happen to the same degree and of course sometimes i just find that I am not enjoying the date or that I don't think we are compatible.  But in cases where I am on a date, I am interested in the woman I am on a date with, I often find myself getting nervous about whether she is interested in me, whether I am saying something to ""screw it up"", when is to soon for a first kiss, and also find myself having to resist the urge to read into every minor word and gesture.  This description may be making it sound worse than it is because this is often just a sort of internal dialogue that I mostly push into the background but on average i definitely feel more anxious and unsure of myself during that sort of time period.  Usually before a first date in terms of asking someone out I can take an ""if it works out it works out"" attitude and for whatever reason after a first kiss I tend to also just have an attitude of ""well if we are actually compatible it will work itself out"" again.  I think what might be because I am pretty self confident in the idea that I'm an interesting and fun person to be around on a basic social level, but much less secure in the idea that someone might actually be romantically or sexually attracted to me. So even if a woman seems very engaged on a date I often can rationalize it as ""well she might just find me an interesting person in a platonic way."" And then for whatever reason a first kiss just kind of satisfies that anxiety. 

So do other people have their own particular anxieties about dating that stand out? Anyone experience something similar? If anyone got over something similar please chime in of course.",1.0,1.0,1.0,194.0,/r/MensLib/comments/i25cxp/talking_through_our_dating_insecurities_starting/,Jon_S111

2020-08-02 18:21:32,Should Men be told to 'stay inside'?,"So basically where I grew up, I was treated horribly because I was told allowed to go anywhere by myself because, in addition to having an overprotective mother, in our society women are seen as having less agency then men. We got told that we can't go anywhere but teen boys are allowed to go and do whatever they want.

I was feeling angry about this until I realized something. Men are much more likely to be physically assaulted then women and in most countries in the world they are more likely to be victims of homicide. I find it hypocritical that male oppressors force women to stay inside (and yes where I live we are literally FORCED) because we might be raped but they don't want to force men to stay inside because of the high likelihood of men being assaulted, robbed or killed?

So that got me thinking, should we encourage men to spend more time at home (especially since men are alot safer at home then women are) or should we just continue to invest more money into our communities to lower the rate of violent crime, or both?

2020-08-02 23:20:29,Black Mirror S5E1: Striking Vipers (Significant spoilers on episode),"I've finally gotten around to getting caught up on the most recent season of Black Mirror and Striking Vipers left me gobsmacked with both the way it handled male intimacy (both the idea that it's ok but also the shame attached to it) but also the way that boundaries are renegotiated when couples are honest about their needs.

I'm polyamorous and so the ending felt a little transactional to me but hey, if it works for them, awesome.

I'm keen to hear what others thought when you first saw the episode (or if you've just watched it so you can take part in this discussion) but also keen to hear from black men who might have a particularly unique viewpoint to share.

2020-08-03 03:32:39,Anti-violence seminars etc.,"Given that most men are not violent or abusive, while some women are, I don't understand why workplace anti-violence seminars, sensitivity training and the like are often required attendance for all male employees but none of the women. Potentially violent people often raise red flags, and likewise there are people that are very respectful and put off by violence. Given all that, why are these seminars targeted towards all men as a group?

It's demeaning towards non-violent and anti-violent men. It's like imposing a form of collective guilt on all men as a group for the behaviour of a small minority of people of all genders. It seems like an ideological decision to target all men - based on feminist theory. And it reinforces the inaccurate notion that there's something potentially wrong with men as a group, while saying that female violence either doesn't exist or doesn't matter. Some of the people who could benefit from the seminars will be excluded by design; then they could go on to commit violence in the future.

What's going on here? Is it ideological? Why not target the seminars more accurately, looking for risk factors for violence? Thanks.

2020-08-05 04:20:35,How to talk about male victims of sexual violence?,"This post is partly based on conversations I've seen here on /r/menslib and partly in the wider world. In short, I've seen some very concerning things, even here in what should be a safe space. Consider everything past this point to have a trigger warning.

So, as the title suggests, I was sexually assaulted on a date two years ago. I don't usually call it rape, but as time goes on, the word seems to fit more. I could share all the details, but that would serve little purpose other than re-traumatizing others. Instead, I'll share the effects it had on me. I get flashbacks that make my body tense and freeze up all the time. Sometimes it happens when something reminds me of her or that night, sometimes it happens when I see discussion about sexual assault in general, or sometimes it just happens with no explanation. I don't say any of this to make you feel sorry for me; I just thought you should know where I'm coming from here.

This all happened right around the time of Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court, so there was a lot of discussion of rape and sexual assault in the news and social media at the time. Of course, because of the specific incident and the epidemic-level rate at which women experience sexual violence, almost all of this discussion was focused on male perpetrators and female victims, often even using ""men"" and ""women"" as shorthand for ""perpetrators"" and ""victims.""

This was awful for me. The constant discussion of rape and sexual assault resurfaced memories of what happened all around me, but in a way that didn't acknowledge me as a victim in the situation. I understand that I'm a bit of a statistical outlier, but human beings are more than just statistics. Maybe it's not worth it to include male victims in the conversation given the gender disparity that does exist, but I have to imagine that we can do better than we currently are.

Of course, anti-feminist spaces also deal with sexual assault in even more horrible ways. Male sexual assault is often used as a response to try to shut down women talking about their experiences. This is disgusting to me; I don't want my trauma to be used as a club to invalidate the all-too-common trauma of women, especially by people who aren't otherwise doing anything about it. Other anti-feminists will bring up false accusations as a response to women talking about rape, but the fact of the matter is that men are more likely to be raped than falsely accused of rape, and casting doubt on survivors' stories helps nobody.

That said, what really made me want to post this now was some concerning conversations I've seen right here in /r/menslib. There have been a few posts about dating advice for men in the last few days, and every single one of them has devolved into conversations about men's insecurities coupled with explanations about how women are afraid of rape and sexual assault. These are important and necessary conversations, especially for men who might not know the extent to which fear of rape governs women's actions, but both sides of these discussions seem to take it for granted that men don't have to worry about it from their end. This is understandable; for a long time, I didn't think it would happen to me. But then it did, and ever since then I've realized that consent going both ways isn't just a platitude: it's the only way to live a moral life and recognize when you've been harmed. A lot of men don't think it will ever happen to them, but it's truly impossible to know, and everybody needs to have a knowledge of consent. Immediately after my traumatic experience, I told some friends about this horrible night I had with sexual contact I didn't want, but I didn't even process the fact that it was sexual assault and arguably rape until they pointed it out to me. I was feeling confusion, self-loathing, and guilt for ""leading her on"" until I realized that I had been violated in that way and that it wasn't my fault. I'm not saying this should be the main focus of /r/menslib or these conversations, but I hope everyone can keep this in mind when having these discussions.

tl;dr a lot of the conversation around sexual assault and rape frames it exclusively as an issue perpetrated by men on victims who are women. While I understand that that's the most common scenario that needs to be addressed, I hope to see a world where male victims are acknowledged more than they currently are. I know there are other men out there like me who are suffering and unsure of how they fit into the conversation, so I want to make sure they have a place. Also, if I've said anything wrong or offensive in this post, please let me know; I'm always trying to do better.",1.0,1.0,1.0,56.0,/r/MensLib/comments/i3qyv3/how_to_talk_about_male_victims_of_sexual_violence/,Aflimacon

2020-08-07 07:02:03,Dating apps and men's self confidence,"So I noticed on a couple of recent discussions about dating that a lot of men have mentioned not only that they find dating apps to be a not very good way of actually finding a date but that the entire experience ended up being really demoralizing and in some cases shattering for their self confidence.  I don't know quite what the solution to that is since dating apps won't go away and like I dunno myself how to design a better one, but I do think I broadly get a sense that it is having a negative effect on some guys who are already maybe feeling somewhat insecure about dating and I wonder if it could be helpful to sort of talk about how they can be this negative experience particularly if you can't sort of emotionally detach yourself from the results. 

I think the problem is particularly bad because dating apps are skewed in their gender ratios compared to real life.  Most dating apps are heavily skewed male ( [this is](http://www.netimperative.com/2019/04/05/online-dating-trends-men-outnumber-women-on-tinder-by-9-to-1-while-grinder-wins-for-age-diversity/) the only study I found from the last couple of years but if anyone else has something else worth adding let me know). 

One other issue that strikes me as a potential problem  - a lot of men might join dating apps precisely because they don't feel like they have a lot of other options or dating experience, but since online dating requires crafting a persona to an extent (not that it is inherently dishonest but like you do have to deliberately pick photos and what you will write in your profile) they might not have a good sense of how to highlight the features that will be most likely to help them in a dating profile.  But that is not something that might not be immediately obvious so it can be easy to take a lack of results as a personal rejection. 

Relatedly I had the observation that a lot of men who have talked about their negative experiences sort of view dating apps as a competition with essentially all other guys, rather than a sort of attempt to find compatibility. I was a bit surprised by that but I would appreciate hearing others' thoughts

Do a lot of people find that dating apps can have this negative effect? Are there ways to use dating apps that can help shield people's self confidence from a potential lack of results?",1.0,1.0,1.0,95.0,/r/MensLib/comments/i52cfx/dating_apps_and_mens_self_confidence/,Jon_S111

2020-08-07 10:24:41,"The notion of being ""attractive"" - can it mess with your head","So the notion that there is a single definition of attractiveness and that everyone will consider the same set of men or women more or less attractive is a pretty common one, and I was thinking about how this can often mess with guys' heads.  Obviously this notion is definitely sometimes applied to women as well but hey this is men's lib and I was specifically thinking of it in connection with what it's like dating as a guy, and in my case one who is interested in dating women.  

So, I think the idea of there being a single universal idea of what makes a man attractive or appealing to date is pretty obviously untrue, but it seems to be kind of pervasive.  I think the reason it can be so hard to shake off is that while there isn't a universal definition of attractiveness, but there are some things that generally are a positive for many or most or almost all women who might be interested in dating men. Like yeah being well groomed is probably usually a good idea.  Being in shape is almost always better than not.  Etc.  But I think people tend to make the mistake that these are the only factors that are actually going to play a role in finding a partner.  So that of course encourages us to compare ourselves to virtually all other guys and if we are not like perfect physical specimens to feel insecure about ourselves.

But I think what this ignores is that sometimes what matters are the things that might not be most universally attractive qualities but things that are particular to each person.  Like tastes in music or personality compatibility or a million other things that might be massively appealing to one potential partner but irrelevant or a turn off to others.  But like for whatever reason this seems to not get factored in to people's sense of self worth.  

What about everyone else? Do you think that there's a single set of factors that determines whether any potential partner is interested?  Do you focus on those things that you know most people find attractive? How much do you think those qualities matter? Does the notion that there is a lot of variety in what a potential partner might value or prioritize seem plausible?",1.0,1.0,1.0,47.0,/r/MensLib/comments/i55iqm/the_notion_of_being_attractive_can_it_mess_with/,Jon_S111

2020-08-08 00:32:27,Random Thought on Improving Clothing Sections/Stores,"This is just a small thought experiment that shouldn't be taken too seriously, but I am genuinely curious to see if other people have thought as much.

Do you see potential positive benefits of the inclusion of unisex section in clothing stores? Because for me, I can only see positives, and, if I had any kind of pull in that industry, I would push for it.  
This was prompted by a few self-centered concerns, naturally, but I can see a lot of other people getting a lot out of it too. I don't know how common it is in all clothing stores around the world, but, most of the time when in a menswear section, I often find myself disappointed by the serious drab display I find. I like bright and bold colours, perhaps set against a distinctive pattern, but the powers that be seem to think that all men prefer things that are irritatingly monochrome, where the only dashes of colour are so pale they look like they'd been diluted beyond recognition. Womens' sections tend to be more colourful, though in a lot of cases I doubt the things I like the look of there (which isn't most things, it has to be said) would even fit me. I think it would therefore be considerably better to introduce unisex sections of such shops, so the things you shop for are all about aesthetic and aren't skewed with the consideration of gender stereotypes. Many online places offer unisex T-shirts, for example, so I can't imagine working on the proportions should necessarily be that difficult (people of all genders have various body types anyway!). If anyone knows if such kinds of shops already exist, then let me know, because I haven't seen any.

2020-08-09 14:43:55,"Why toxic ""resources"" for men thrive - they tell vulnerable men what they want to hear","So I was thinking about  [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/i3o818/we_need_to_find_a_way_to_help_men_access_real_help/) and why things like PUA sites and incel forums end up being so appealing.  And what I think is a major reason is that they each in a different way tell a certain subset of men who are frustrated with dating that what they already believe is true.  So like a lot of guys who struggle with dating feel like there is some kind of code they haven't cracked, and conventional advice like ""just be yourself"" etc seems like someone is hiding the code book from them.  So what do pua sites do? they say ""here is the code book have at it"".  Now it might all be total bs or manipulative but it is going to seem super appealing if you feel like someone is finally giving you the real deal.  Similarly some men feel like if they aren't finding a relationship it must be because they are fundamentally unattractive, and if they express this most people will push back, but the incel community says ""absolutely.""  So I think what can be tricky about addressing these things in a more ethical way is that 1) sometimes the ethical thing to say is ""we don't have all the answers"" which is unsatisfying and 2) addressing these things ethically means you can't just affirm whatever it is someone believes if it isn't actually true.   And like the specific question of ""why am I struggling with dating"" doesn't have a one size fits all answer because there could be a lot of reasons for particular individuals.",1.0,1.0,1.0,87.0,/r/MensLib/comments/i6exdb/why_toxic_resources_for_men_thrive_they_tell/,Jon_S111

2020-08-10 10:52:16,A statistic from 1 in 6 (sexual abuse trigger warning),"In a recent discussion on the sexual assault of males, someone posted a link to the [1in6 website]""https://1in6.org/get-information/the-1-in-6-statistic/"".

One of the more fascinating statistics I found on the webpage is as follows...

&gt;Only 16% of men with documented histories of sexual abuse (by social service agencies, which means it was very serious) considered themselves to have been sexually abused, compared to 64% of women with documented histories in the same study.


I know that in starting discussions we're asked to provide or own thoughts on the discussions we start,  but I'm somewhat at a loss here.   I definitely don't wish this to turn into a discussion about relative prevalence of female/male sexual abuse rates,  but I'm absolutely astounded at the idea that even in clearly abusive situations,  men are extremely unlikely to consider themselves as victims of abuse. 

Does anyone have any ideas what goes into unpacking that statistic?  I know that in discussing incidents from my own past,  I've heard a plethora of comments from both men and women suggesting that it doesn't quite count as abuse (she must have really liked you/ like any guy would turn down sex/  you'd be a fool to complain about that/  that's not sexual harassment, it's fucking awesome/ but she's hot,  e.t.c)

But I'm really sort of astonished that you can put a guy into a situation that's abusive enough that social services is involved,  and they'll still not recognize it as abuse. 

What are the stories guys tell themselves in such situations?  Is there a compelling need (internal or external) for them to deny that they've been abused?  Does it help men to view themselves as victims (this is a question that's been put to me directly before)?  Does it help them to (be able to) recognize abuse when it happens?  Do the people who prey on males count on this ignorance to cover their actions?  Do they facilitate it (gaslighting) to cover their own abusive behaviors?  Is this mentality limited solely to sexually abusive behaviors?

I'm having quite a time working through my feelings and thoughts on this.

2020-08-10 16:24:00,How do I tactfully integrate trans men with feminism without making them feel dysphoric?,"Hi r/menslib! 

Let me explain my position. Basically I believe that feminism is for everyone and everyone regardless of gender is welcome in the feminist community. I still believe however that a majority of feminist resources should be used to aid women (just like a majority of menslib resources should be used to help men). That being said, trans men do face some issues that are also considered feminist issues. 

First let me say that I am a trans ally. I have been one for many years now, and I consider trans men = men and trans women = women. That being said trans men will have certain experiences that cis men don't and that are also considered feminist issues.

For example, especially if you are a trans man and you probably got treated 'like a girl' before you came out. Many trans men grew up being viewed as little girls before coming up as trans. That means that they faced the challenges of being a young girl without being a girl i.e having a stricter dress code at school, being  bullied in a sexist way, gender roles pushed on them, doing unequal housework etc. And even when trans men grow up, depending on where you are at during your transition, trans men might still need to use certain hygiene products or reproductive rights. So issues like the pink tax and access to abortion will still effect them, which is a big part of feminist issues.

Now, here is my problem. I want to know how to bring this up in feminist and trans circles without making trans men feel dysphoric and I certainly don't want them to think that I feel like they aren't 'real men' so if anyone (especially trans men) on this sub have any input than please let me know how you feel about this.

I have been now told by three professionals to “man up” when I freak the fuck out with their hands in my mouth. 

I have PTSD (unrelated to dental work) and having my panic not handled is really bad. Snoop my posts if you want. It’s really bad to be told that I am less of a man because I cry when they manipulate my mouth. It’s terrifying and I am not less of a man for being distressed. 

(I called my insurance company today to find a location that is covered to do sedated care. A place that did it for my ex who was a veteran with dental anxiety is covered so I suspect they will do well.)

2020-08-13 02:36:00,How do you set up healthy sensual boundaries for yourself without being too free or too restrictive?,"**TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM**

I hope I can phrase this topic in a way that is suitable for the subreddit. My thought train was triggered by [this recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/i8cy3e/girl_randomly_groped_my_ass_at_a_party_but_i_kind/) about the dude who got groped at a party and didn't quite know how to feel about it.

Positive touch is something that's not uncommon to talk about on this sub. It's healthy when done in a proper, consensual manner. I think we can all agree on this. But I feel like, for myself, finding that line is difficult. Not with other's boundaries - I'm personally pretty keen on that. It's more like knowing where and how to set them for myself. For the entirety of this post, I'd like to quickly emphasize that I'm exclusively talking about *sensual* touch (hugs, cuddles, etc.) as opposed to *sexual* touch. Also, this is mostly to do with touch from people one's attracted to (My personal example would be with women) but the following discussion could easily reach beyond that limitation if desired.

Like the previous post talked about, men can be touch deprived. This makes it so that when those men do get some touch (positive or otherwise), they can have some trouble interpreting how to feel about it. I'm touch deprived myself these days, and as a result, I'm hyper-sensitive towards it now. Touch, when it's positive, feels *really really good*.

Because it feels so good, I have a tendency to be pretty open to it. I've been single all my adult life, which helps. Historically, my boundaries around casual touch have been fairly loose as a result. Pretty indiscriminate, all said and done. Whatever I could get, and whatever was appropriate, that's what I would take. But there's been some stuff that I've realized about myself recently, and it has to do with my reaction towards being touched.

I find that a lot of the time, if I'm trouched, it triggers this pressing desire to get more of it, because it feels so good. In the rare times that the urge gets satisfied, I mellow out, and I can take more casual touch more often without harm. If that urge to be touched isn't satisfied, which is more often the case with being both casual and appropriate, it drains my mental health very quickly. I'm left feeling worse than I was if I had just not let the person hug me at all. This has consequently lead me to start being much more reserved about my boundaries. It's because I want to be touched so badly that I actually withhold it from myself, just because I know at this point that casual encounters with touch are rarely enough to satisfy me.

While this has led to a somewhat improved mental state, there's a pang within me that still wishes to be as free as I was before. And if I had a reliable source of touch in my life to satisfy the greater urges, I think I could be. Avoiding touch hasn't done anything to satiate my touch hunger. At the end of the day, I do still want to be touched.

These boundaries that I'm setting for myself are confusing. I'm not sure where I should really be placing them. If I'm free about it, it leads to pain from unresolved natural desires. If I'm restrained, there's some relief, but I still don't get touched while putting up a high sort of benchmark for how much touch would be required from someone before they can actually do it (e.g. cuddle with me or forget it). Each one seems problematic.

Maybe I'm thinking about boundaries in the wrong way? I seem to focus on the act being done as opposed to who's doing it. Both are factors in boundary setting for sure, and the emphasis may even be reversed depending on who you talk to.

Maybe I should just go Buddhist and don't get overwhelmed by my desires? That's really difficult in this case (I've tried - this is definitely one of my weaknesses). I'm trying to find ways around that before submitting myself to such difficult, lifelong work.

I can't help but think that it's also a somewhat systematic issue that has helped put me into this double-bind. If men weren't seen as inherently dangerous or didn't have a reputation for misconduct, and if women weren't seen as helpless or without agency, maybe we as a society would be more open to having solutions for issues like this. Obviously this isn't purely systematic, but I'm sure it plays a role. If I wasn't seen as such a threat, maybe it'd be easier to find reliable sources of consensual, sensual touch. Maybe not. I wouldn't mind some discussion around that aspect, though I don't think of it as being the crux of my particular issue by any means. I certainly don't see resolution coming from such broad lines of thinking either.

Anyway, I'd appreciate some help and some discussion about how one goes about setting boundaries for one's self. Because currently, with whatever it is I'm setting for myself, I find myself losing one way or the other.

**TL;DR:** Knowing how to set boundaries for myself in terms of sensual (not sexual) touch is confusing me. I used to be care-free about it, but because it leads to pain from unfulfilled desires, I've restrained it. This has only helped a little, leading to a different set of problems, and hasn't really lead to the solution I'm looking for. Some discussion around how one goes about setting boundaries successfully as well as what determines these sorts of things would be appreciated.",1.0,1.0,1.0,13.0,/r/MensLib/comments/i8jblv/how_do_you_set_up_healthy_sensual_boundaries_for/,Vinylismist

2020-08-14 04:12:35,"In the same way that toxic general roles push women into being Sex Objects, they also push men into being Sex Subjects, and that can be just as harmful but in different ways.","I don't think that I need to explain to the people here why objectifying people (without their consent) is bad. Treating a real Person with their own thoughts, desires, and dreams as a tool to be used only for your own amusement is a toxic and harmful behavior that shouldn't have any place in a healthy society.

However, because of the traditional gender roles assigned to people, men are compelled to be Sex Subjects, those who *perform* sex, whether that's what they want or not.

If you look on /r/sex, there is a stead stream of posts from women who wish their male partners would be more vocal and enthusiastic. They're tired of sleeping with silent, stoic, unenthusiastic people and wish that they would express themselves more. Ironically, there is simultaneously a number of posts from (typically young) men who are timidly asking whether women would even consider men moaning and vocalizing sexy at all!

Why is there such a disconnect? Why are these young men fundamentally not aware of what might make them seem so much sexier to their (female) partners?

Because society tells men that they aren't supposed to be ""sexy"", at least not in the same way that women are. Sex is supposed to be something that men pursue, something they try to earn, something they have to *convince* women to put up with on their behalf. Even the language we use to describe men's sexuality is charged with this; you are trying to *perform*, you want to *get some*, its all about *the chase*. Society sees sex as fundamentally transactional, where women are auctioning the right to have sex off to the highest bidder.

What actually are conventional notions of male attractiveness? No, seriously, what makes a man physically desirable? Our ideas of what the ideal male suitor (another transactional title) are so charged with ideas of proving your worth: wealthy, powerful, confident, charismatic, famous. Heck, the sexiest thing a man is traditionally allowed to do is to *turn down* a woman's advances, because he's so able to *get sex whenever he wants* that he doesn't need to chase every opportunity. 

I experienced this disconnect when I was first starting my relationship with my now wife. I realized that I didn't actually know what I was supposed to do to be a desirable partner to her. Not that I wasn't good at it, or not confident enough, but that I literally didn't even know what I was supposed to aim for. I had never considered what women consider attractive in men, and I didn't even have a concept in mind for what to do, outside of some absurd bodybuilder shtick, which was clearly not what women actually valued. 

The thing is, when I actually *asked* her about it, *she* couldn't come up with a general idea either! At least not one that she had the vocabulary to express out loud. Ultimately we resorted to getting naked and pointing and describing things that she liked and basically reverse-engineering what exactly it was that she was seeking.

Fundamentally, men's and women's sexuality isn't as vastly different as pop culture would lead you to believe. In both cases, individual tastes and preferences are going to vary a lot more than gender-wide averages, if such a thing can even be defined. Confidence and knowing what you want is attractive, a well-taken-care-of body goes a long way. For men in specific, (straight) women seem to focus on male-specific shapes and outlines the same way that (straight) men focus on waists and hips and breasts. Toned forearms, more muscular and less curvaceous legs, a flatter lower stomach instead of the more rounded version women of the same body type have. Stronger chest and shoulders. Some women appreciate body hair and beards, especially since its trendy these days. 

But most of all, *enthusiasm* is sexy, and I think this is the part that many men (including myself) struggle with. Make noise during sex! Unashamedly admit what you want. Let yourself get lost in the moment and stop trying so hard to ""perform"". Complement your partner on what feels good, and when you get complemented accept it, don't just shrug it off or deny it. Its ok to involuntarily start going faster because its overwhelmingly good. Its also ok to turn down sex when you're not in the mood! Men aren't mindless sex machines, and your consent is equally important in any relationship.

2020-08-15 08:40:15,Strategies for talking about gender across generations.,"I’ve been running into some difficulties regarding my six-month old son and members of my family who are older (my son’s grandparents, older uncles and aunts, etc.). It’s nothing outright horrible but something that I believe warrants me having a conversation with them.

What I’m looking to correct is their language and attitude toward him which has no malice behind it, it’s just at best misplaced and at worst ignorant. Comments like “that’s a girly outfit, we’ll get you a manly one” and acting as though there’s some familial prerogative to toughen him up. It comes solely from the older members of my family, so I’m assuming it’s largely generational.

Now these are intelligent, caring, and liberal people, just old. I think I can help correct the error of their ways without confrontation as long as I can communicate things at their level.

Have you had a similar experience and what worked for you? I know I can communicate what I want to have happen, but I just would like to do it in a way that doesn’t belittle or besmirch anyone. Or if it has to, as little as possible.

I would happily call myself a feminist and have also been engaging in more leftist politics over the past year or so. Despite the fact that I align with the prescribed leftist and feminist values that come with opposing the patriarchy and other forms of oppressive hierarchies I can't help but feel like some of my behaviours and internal thoughts don't follow the same values and that they actually enforce the systems which I oppose.

When I see a women the first thing I think about is whether or not that person is attractive and in some cases whether or not I would want to engage in sexual intercourse with them (I'm cringing writing this). I'm very aware that I treat women differently than men and often am more amiable towards women, I even tend to feel much more intimidated when within the presence of a women.

I feel like a lot of what I mentioned in the last paragraph is largely due to my own inexperience with women both romantically and sexually. I have never had sex and I have never had a romantic relationship either and my strong desire to be in a relationship seems opposite to the current feminist message of finding happiness outside of relationships. I've often struggled with loneliness and finding friends anyway and I can't help but feel like I fit all of the descriptions of an incel except for the fact that I don't blame these issues all on women.

2020-08-17 05:55:01,Would you be fine with visiting a male psychotherapist?,"Tldr in the title.

(inspired by a recently shared great article: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/iaqgbm/psychotherapy_has_failed_men_by_not_recognizing/, but only somehow related)

Background: I'm a man, almost 30, have problems with depression and anxiety (mostly social). A few months ago I finally pushed myself to give psychotherapy a second chance. But when searching for a therapist, something occurred, which I dismissed back then, but which now came back when reading the article: it's how extremely uneasy I felt with the idea of choosing a male therapist.

There's a lot of male therapists in the area. Rationally thinking, they can't be any worse than female. There's no rule saying men are by definition less emotionally intelligent, less understanding, supportive, etc... especially when talking about experts with many years of emotional help experience.

Knowing that I have anxiety problems, you perhaps understand how hard it was for me to even imagine explaining my emotional issues to an unknown person. I was staring at photos of the therapists, trying to imagine, how they are and how I'd talk with them. Even with women it was very hard, but with men it felt almost impossible. Apparently just a look of a male face, or imagination of talking to a man, made me feel emotionally restrained. Some of the things I wanted to share felt very ""embarrassing"", and I just couldn't imagine a man being understanding and compassionate enough to handle that.

And this is coming from a person believing (maybe correctly, maybe wrongly) to be mostly free from ""toxic masculinity"". Apparently, even though I don't see it in myself, I'm suspicious of other men being so.

At the end I decided on a female therapist. Although the choice turned out to be pretty good (it's a few months already and I think I made some progress),  I'm still wondering why I felt this way back then. Is it just me, or are there more people having it the same? Do you also feel this emotional-level prejudice against men, in regards to sharing more private, emotional matters?",1.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ib1b70/would_you_be_fine_with_visiting_a_male/,fideasu

2020-08-17 09:38:28,Can anyone please help me understand why do many men don't seek medical treatment when something is obviously very wrong?,"This is personal, so I understand if it can't be posted.  But I had a devastating encounter with my uncle yesterday.  I saw him a couple months ago, he's almost 80 and diabetic.  He had a bad abscess on his toe he went to the ER for.  I bugged him for weeks to go.  Now two months I keep begging for him to see a doctor.  He's refused.  I called yesterday and asked about it and said it was just itching badly.  That alarmed me.  I drove 2 hours to his place.  I inspected his toe, it was horrific it was black and oozing green.  Then I saw maggots poking in and out of the wound.  I'll be honest  I lost it.  And probably for the first time in my life I became hysterical.  To the point I couldn't breath.  I am still reeling from this over 24 hours later.

I have tried to pinpoint in society where men are getting the idea that not seeking medical treatment is OK?  When we're kids our parents take us to the doctor.  If you're injured in a car crash, men are taken by ambulance to the hospital.  If you break a bone you obviously go to the hospital.  I don't understand where the message to men is coming from that not seeking treatment is somehow manly?  Is having maggots in a badly infected toe manly?  I don't get it?  Can someone help me pin point this absolutely absurd notion that going to the doctor isn't for men?

I apologize if this comes off as unsympathetic.  Like I said, I'm still trying to deal with and process this.  This wasn't the only time I've seen a man have maggots in an infected wound.  I've seen this horror on construction sites.    But they weren't my uncle and almost 80 years old and diabetic.  These guys have time to go to bars and such, but not a doctor?

Woman holding a nice black high heel shoe asks the clerk: “Do you have this shoe in men’s”

Clerk: “Mens?”

Woman: “Cheaper price and actually confortable to wear”

Clerk, angry: “No we do not”

The post was clearly intended to comment on the fact that mens shoes are often cheaper and/or more comfortable than women’s (I haven’t researched if this is true but i wouldn’t be shocked). However it also inadvertently commented on the fact that women have much more variety and choice when it comes to shoes and clothing in general (the shoe is quite literally not available in men’s). I think acknowledging that both men and woman can be oppressed by the same system is important to reaching equality.

2020-08-18 05:47:54,"Learning to not ask my partner ""what's wrong?"", or: Stop Being a ""Fixer""","A tiny backstory, I used to be guilty of being what my dad cautiously calls a ""love mechanic,"" in that I try to diagnose problems and fix them to keep the relationship afloat. One of my worst habits was asking my partner ""what's wrong?"" when I thought something was amiss in their demeanor. I would await their reporting of whatever the issue is, and then try to respond then and there to fix it. If they were hesitant, I would press, arguing ""if something's wrong you need to tell me; we have to communicate"" or something like that. Full disclosure, I genuinely did just believe in unfiltered communication, always. I thought communication = healthy and that this equation always holds, whether the communication was rehearsed or instinctive, honest or deceptive. I fell for the trap of ""joking"" about partners who say ""I'm fine"" when they're not fine, and feeling righteous and clever for knowing things are not fine. ""What's wrong?"" was my tool, and I used it to great effect to ""fix"" - or so I thought.

Here's why I think I was dead wrong:

1. When you ask your partner ""what's wrong?"", the danger is you are probably coming from a place of genuine concern. In that state of mind, you see their reluctance to respond as dishonest, or actively harming the relationship. Then, as a fixer, you fear that things are falling apart, and press with greater intensity, because ah yes - knowing ""what's wrong"" in this exact moment will fix everything \\s. They were just moping around waiting for you to ask, and they were searching for answers and thank god they opened up because you gave them the solutions \\s.
2. When you ask your partner ""what's wrong?"", you are essentially asking their emotions to play to your schedule. You want to know *right now* what's wrong, despite the fact that they may not be ready to talk right now. Olive branch, there are plenty of contexts in which wanting to know ""what's wrong?"" is appropriate; I'm not disputing that. What I'm getting at is that often, the phrase is spoken and pressed with an inappropriate intensity, multiple times, when it's clear that the other party does not intend to have a conversation. It's a powerless feeling not knowing what's wrong, especially if you're at the heart of what's wrong - I get that - but the other person is not required to answer your interrogatives. Now, if your partner does this all the time and it's affecting *your* mental health, you are free to voice that to them and expect different behavior moving forward. But if you don't get the kind of communication you're after, ultimately the only thing that can really change is whether you two are together, and that's the piece you have control over. The only obligations I have for you are that you take care of yourself and be the best partner you can; if something the other person is doing is affecting your health, it's on you to leave, not on them to change (this statement is meant to be independent of abusive situations wherein leaving is difficult or impossible; that said, even there the end goal is to get the hell out of dodge, and to hell this abusive person).
3. If you can tell that your partner is upset, and they're not sharing why with you, they may have not fully internalized why they are upset, and need more time to think on it. Other voices can cloud your thoughts, so ""talking it out"" when you aren't ready to is having your partner invade your train of thought. Whether they mean to or not, their intervention will affect how you process what you're thinking, rather than it being purely *you*. If your partner really wants to know ""what's wrong?"" and wants the unadulterated truth, the best they can do is wait until you're ready to talk. Further, they may ultimately realize they weren't actually upset, and just needed time to process things. An adult will respect that you gave them that space. This is separate from ignoring how your partner is feeling and never checking in with them, but ""how are you?"" is a far cry from ""what's wrong? Tell me! We have to communicate!""
4. Asking ""what's wrong?"" is a directly negative payload. It may seem passive aggressive to retreat back to saying something like ""is there anything on your mind?"" / ""what're you thinking about?"" / ""is there something you want to talk about?"" but they at very least afford your partner the ability to code their thoughts as having any connotation, rather than something being ""wrong"" in your verbage. It may seem like mountains out of molehills, and it may be that something is very overtly wrong, but it's your partner's thoughts, and they should be afforded the ability to code them. Assuming that something is ""wrong"" prods their thoughts and can feel like you're trying to guess at what they're thinking. (Obviously, if they're crying, there's a strong signal something is wrong; ""what's wrong?"" probably makes more sense here than ""how are you?"", you sarcastic fool! If it turns out they're crying happy tears because they found out swans can be gay, it's a benign misunderstanding).
5. If you ask your partner ""what's wrong?"" and expect answers then and there, you are implicitly on the hook to respond then and there. When your partner asks *you* ""what's wrong,"" it's only fair to expect immediate answers from you as well. Your responses will be instantaneous, and as such, you won't had much time to think about what you're going to say. If you give your partner space to breathe and think things through, you have a stronger claim at being entitled to think things through yourself. They can tell you what's wrong after they've had time to organize it, and this is beneficial for three reasons: one, there's a much lower chance of there being something missing that they bring up later, meaning once the discussion's had, it's done. Two, whatever they have to say is going to be communicated probably more clearly, and miscommunication is the cause of a lot of arguments. Three, when you give them their space, you are strongly entitled to say ""okay, let me think on this for a bit"" and you two can deal with the issue in a very clean, calm manner.
6. It is not a ""gotcha"" to find out that your partner *is* upset when they previously said they *weren't* upset. First, it could be the truth, that thinking more brought them to being upset. They're allowed to change how they feel. Checking in at 12pm to find ""nothing"" wrong only to discover something's wrong at 5pm doesn't mean they lied. Second, even if they did lie, this isn't a game where you're trying to catch them in one and then you ""win."" You can have your victory lap in your head, but really should be internalizing: why did they lie at first? If they're dishonest with you, do you think it's because they're being shitty, or scared, or didn't want to make it a real issue? Maybe they thought they could deal with it on their own and actually solve whatever problem it was by thinking it through. Or maybe it's because it's hard to tell you the truth? Maybe you have a habit of trying to get them to ""talk things through"" at the instant something is wrong, not allowing them that aforementioned time to think. Maybe they *want* that unadulterated time to think. Anything is possible, but using ""what's wrong?"" as a constant litmus test of your partner's emotions, and a check-in for whether you've fucked up, is a waste of time.
7. If your partner is in general cryptic, indirect, dishonest, and it's a consistent pattern, that's an issue with the relationship - not something directly solved by saying ""what's wrong?"" Do you really want to live in a relationship where the *only* times things get resolved is when *you* exert, step in, and try to fix things? If things are genuinely *only* ever fixed when you step in, you're repairing a car, not mending a relationship. This repair system is one-sided; if it's true that you are a proven ""fixer,"" and a successful one, do you really want to live like that? If you abandoned this one-sided effort, do things just go to shit? Maybe that's what's meant to happen, then; if your partner does *nothing* to present issues to you, and does *nothing* to deal with matters on their own, and does *nothing* to talk things through with you together (and I mean actually talk things through, not ""here's my list of problems, now answer for your crimes""), you are likely not in a good thing, or with a person who's right for you, to begin with. With maturity, patience, and respect, the right partner is afforded time to think, gives you time to think, and is always your teammate, your friend, always on your side when it comes to resolving ""what's wrong?""",1.0,1.0,1.0,30.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ibnqc4/learning_to_not_ask_my_partner_whats_wrong_or/,eadala

2020-08-18 14:50:34,Men Always Want Sex,"In a recent thread,  u/Tamen_ made this observation...

&gt;I strongly suspect that more men are aware that they are capable of not wanting sex than there are women being aware of this. I also suspect that a lot of young men don't feel they can express that they do not want sex without their partner or other people makes a lot of assumptions about them (he must be gay, he finds me unattractive and so on). I suspect they too often have sex without really wanting to because dealing with the fallout of saying no is just too stressful/time consuming/emotionally draining/futile.

I don't disagree with this at all.   In point of fact,  I'd even take it a few steps further.   I can want sex and still not be obliged to have it. 

- I can want sex,  but not with you. 
- I can want sex,  but not like this. 
- I have gay friends that want sex,  but not with women. 
- I have religious friends who want sex,  but not outside the parameters of a committed relationship. 
- I can want sex,  but not right now. 
- I have asexual friends that aren't very interested in sex at all. 
- I can want sex, and be upset with the way you're trying to use that against me.   

The list is pretty much endless.   And it fascinates me that this is even a remotely novel concept. 

Does anyone else have stories of being pressured to want sex?  Have you ever felt pushed into sex in situations where it wasn't what you were looking for?  I've a also had friends suggest that they've never turned down sex,  because they figured they might as well get it while the getting is good.  Does the fact that we want sex mean we can't also have standards or boundaries?

I found myself agreeing with a lot of it, and it's not the first time I've heard similar arguments, how there exists some general differences between the makeup of the average male and female brain, but it's a very obscured area in most gender politics. In my own country when clinical neurologists were to weigh in on political policy regarding how to improve boys school performance, I saw it too. In the report there was a very anxious four page long preface where the neurologists had to cushion the blow of what they were going to say, like they were afraid of backlash. Their report was about how cognitive developement in young men naturally has a different pace (most of the time), and how boys in general may be more stimulated by methods than those which fits most girls. None of it seemed very controversial to me.

This is not to say that it applies to each and every person. There's more difference between any two individuals than there is between gender. Only when you look at a large enough number of men and women, some of these differences are very observable, and can't all be explained by culture and upbringing.

First things first, she's a shitty person. Her badges of honour (that I know of, and I'm not close with her at all) include:

* Being a pretentious film kid and publicly shitting on other people's taste in films (not that bad tbh, but stick around, it gets worse)
Saying that men will never be true feminists
Saying that male assault victims ""must have done something to deserve it"" (verbatim)
Today she posted a picture on her spam account of Jesus having sex, and when one of her religious close friends asked her to remove it, she removed her from the spam. One of her ***closest*** friends.



Now another big part of her issue is that whenever I've tried to call out her toxic behaviour and iterated that it isn't reflective of feminist ideology, she retorts by calling me a misogynist, telling me I'm oppressing her, and telling me a man has no right to tell her what true feminism looks like. Honestly, her actions today were the breaking point for me.

This makes me wonder: am I the only one who feels that ""fighting the good fight"" - if you will - makes certain people feel entitled and immune to criticism?

2020-08-19 15:18:03,Whats your opinion of narrow male sexual roles?,"Some would say men are both the most variable gender in terms of personality, behavioral disposition,  and ""out there"" preferences(male variability hypothesis), whilst at the same time, men are the gender most likely to repress their unique individual preferences when it comes to conforming to the range of acceptable behaviour that our patriarchial culture see as desirable and ""manly"". Although its important to point out that women have their own issues with their sexual repression and I dont want this thread to turn into a toxic ""who has it worse"" debate. 


Ive known quite a few sex positive college escorts whove told me that with many men being shamed to commit to a narrow range of sexual behaviour by women and other men that is seen as sexy and masculine, and sex being scarce for the average single man,  many men never really fully explore their sexuality as much as the average sexually liberated women where kinks and out of the norm sexual preference are far more acceptable . These escorts, specialist in the taboo fantasies of men, are always in demand by men of all types of attractiveness, ages and cultural backgrounds, who feel like they can never explore that side of themselves with their partners or FWBs without being shamed by their lovers and ridiculed by other men, or when they do' its tolerated less than conventional sex where they perform the traditional role. (In fact an escort I knew even went to the middle east for a month to see her rich client who had a thing for domination and was so conscious about being seen with a dominatrix from Australia that he pretended she was an intern looking for a position at his firm)


Many have also tried to join the BDSM community but have had bad experiences as a result of the shortage of non Sub women and the extremes of some dominatrix.

Porn use has shown us that men can have wildly diverse sexual fantasies as well. Im sure most men will never want to live out those fantasies, just as the same for women. But I cant help but think there's a large cohort of men who also do want to live out these experiences, and alternative roles, whether that is being dominated to being pursued by a woman and becoming the object of ""desire. But because of the ""man box"", the scarcity of sex and the importance of fulfilling the performative masculine role for many heterosexual women in evoking sexual desire or ""getting turned on"",  most men are pressured into a narrow role. 

 Ive had friends who are very open about their sex lives and feel the same way about this issue, and we all came to realisation that we didnt like always being pidgeonholed into the dom or the active agent role, yet felt pressured by our partners and society to fulfill that role. And a few of the progressive women weve had close friendships with have candidly admitted that they just cant accept sexual passivity or alternative roles for their sexual partners and believe most women are in the same boat, based on their talks with other women about sex. Although I may just be the wierd one or live in a bubble and perhaps the average man is content with rigid sex roled.

 Do you think this is a problem Menslib can address or is this just one of the hard facts of life that most men who arent stereotypically masculine need to accept?",1.0,1.0,1.0,67.0,/r/MensLib/comments/icj1fk/whats_your_opinion_of_narrow_male_sexual_roles/,wazzoz99

Consent is a big thing obviously, and has some niches and nuanced scenarios where the basic rules may be blurred, but it still stands that no means no. 

For those of you who need to hear about the rules of consent either to help you in tough situations, or to make sure your never in a tough situation, there is a great short video that explains it pretty well

It goes over unconsciousness, saying yes at first then saying no, saying maybe then no and a few other scenarios people may find themselves in.

2020-08-20 10:25:48,Statutory rape of males and desire as power play.,"So my thoughts are still very much in process on this,  but...

There's a recurring discussion (often with quite a bit of negative pushback) about the ""willingness"" of young boys to engage in sex with older women.   We've all seen it at one point or another,  the endless stream of comments to the effect of ""when I was 16, I'd have fucked my chem teacher in a heartbeat"" or ""where were the teachers like these back when I was in high school?""

As I spend more time considering this,  I can't help but think that this very willingness,  far from excusing the behavior,  is actually what defines it as a power play.  Most 15 year old males would probably have sex in almost any circumstances.   The fact that a 26 year old teacher is aware of this is exactly what makes the behavior exploitative (exploiting a young boy's willingness and natural sexual awakening), attempting simply to get herself some.   

A few years back,  a former classmate (35 at the time?) had posted on Facebook about an incident that had occurred while she was waiting in line in the grocery store.   She'd overheard two young teens commenting about her. 

The first teen commented to his friends that she was hot.   The second mentioned that she had a ring and was obviously married.   ""I don't care, "" the first teen said,  ""I'd still hit that. ""

The classmate posted that story with the statement ""Yeah,  I've still got it. ""

The same classmate also had a propensity for posting comments about how ""yummy"" various younger service staff were if she were out for drinks or dinner.   I'd eventually made the decision that if I saw her do it again,  I might point out that such behaviors might be inappropriate,  especially in a post-metoo environment. 

Before I had the opportunity, I found out that she'd been picked up by police for having sex with one of the students at the high school where she was a guidance counselor,  12 counts of aggravated sexual assault for sleeping with a 12th grader 12 times. 

Is it possible to rape the ""willing""?  Is it possible to use someone's natural urges against them?  Can engendering desire (or leveraging it where it appears) in people be its own form of power play or manipulation? If so,  does this dynamic end at the age of majority?  

Like I said,  my own thoughts on this are completely in early stages. 

Does anyone have any thoughts of their own?",1.0,1.0,1.0,99.0,/r/MensLib/comments/id1w52/statutory_rape_of_males_and_desire_as_power_play/,Uniquenameofuser1

2020-08-24 02:26:20,"Hetero Non dominant/Sub men, how do you deal with living in a society that is seeing a resurgence/strengthening of masculine norms?","This thread is a related to a previous thread on a similar topic that was made a few days. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/icj1fk/whats_your_opinion_of_narrow_male_sexual_roles/

After reading many eye opening replies about how Sub men feel sexually repressed, I want to know how Sub/non dominant men here deal with the ever creeping resurgence of hypermasculine norms that is becoming quite popular in places like the Anglosphere, in part because of the rise of patriarchial reactionary right wing WASP culture, the popularity of hypermasculinity worship in our youth culture, the patriarchy and heterosexual dating?

Personally Ive been struggling with sexual and emotional repression for half my life as a sensitive slightly submissive man and its been quite taxing on my mental health. I live in one of the most conservative Anglo cultures when it comes to rigid  masculinity and the worship of trad masculine ideals(Australia). 

I think we will need to wait another 50 years for male liberation because of how entrenched and lauded those ideals have become by most people of both side of the ideological spectrum. It seems like different expressions of masculinity is only tolerated among the LGBT community here. Heterosexual masculinity hasnt changed much since the 80s, with the exception of homophobia and sexism becoming much more frowned upon. 

As a relatively young guy(25), Ive witnessed rigid masculinity being reinforced by successive waves of male youth cultural movements that I thought would have gone out of vogue by now, but which seems to be embraced by even gen Z dudes. And most empowered feminist women I know pedestalise the ever dominant,  and stoic masculine ideal in their dating lives whilst paying lip service to the menslib cause. 


 Ive given up on the idea of mens liberation. I dont think Ill see it in my lifetime and now I want to know how make the best of a shitty situation. 

 So I ask this to older dudes who arent naturally dominant or identify as a Sub and similarly detest narrow masculinity, how did you deal with a repressive situation for so long without succumbing to bitterness?

Serano is a trans woman who examines the ""predator/prey"" mindsets and metaphors that inform our sexual politics, and how gender interacts and is influenced by those metaphors.   As a transwoman, she's seen a bit of this from either side of the gender divide.   

As a man who's been sexually assaulted by numerous women,  I find her perspective on how society views sexual assault of males differently than that of women to be particularly noteworthy.  And I've found that trans men have been among the most sympathetic to complaints of my own treatment at times. 

She also examines the double bond that many men feel they're placed in, both being expected to be aggressive,  but entirely sensitive at the same time.

I just saw a post in TIL that reminded me about this:

[TIL if a beta male mandrill wins a fight, it physically transforms into an alpha male over time - gaining larger testicles, skin coloration, and the ability to produce offspring](https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/ifoqk0/til_if_a_beta_male_mandrill_wins_a_fight_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Many of you may already know this, but I think it bears repeating.  For humans, there is more evidence that it is actually the *behaviors* that cause increased testosterone, not the other way around.

Here's another link with some research:

2020-08-24 23:15:24,"I need some help, idk who to ask","Hello,


So I recently moved into University for my first year (and what a year to do that lol). I need some advice about life, and I figured y'all would be good to ask.


So a bit of pretext: I am a straight white 18 year old male who has never had a girlfriend but has been on a date (she asked me out). I was too insecure to ever really try and date earlier on, but I'm a lot more confident now and have worked through some issues, but know I'm kinda stuck cause I have no experience dating people at all and idk how to proceed. I have never had trouble being friends with girls or anything, a lot of my close friends are girls, but idk how to actually go about dating/flirting/any of that stuff. My parents aren't any help here cause a) they're separated and b) my dad is hardcore into like the red pill, guys should be alpha asshole thing, which just isn't who I am (he advised that I should date two women at once in college because ""that's the college culture"", just to give you an idea of the quality of advice I got. I do try not to be an asshole and I'm not going to follow through with his suggestion). 

Anyways, I don't really know who to turn to. I just have no idea what I'm doing. I guess my question is, what should I know before getting into the college dating pool? My current understanding of how relationships should work is that you hang out with someone for a while and if you seem to like them as more than friends, you say like, ""hey, I like you, and I'd love to ask you out on a proper date. Wanna get coffee sometime?"", or something like that. If she says yes, great, if not oh well, I can still be friends with her.

Is that like the correct framework for approaching things? I hear a lot of conflicting stuff like ""ohh nice guys finish last"" but that doesn't really seem to match with reality, I have friends who date non-assholes all the time. And like I said, my dad is hard into the red pill stuff so I don't exactly get good advice at home. My mom's advice is better, but a bit antiquated. I just need some help on this front.

2020-08-25 15:13:57,I’m Single AF - But Not Interested in You - Unreasonable Dating Standards,"How many times have I written something on this and deleted it for being dumb?

I know I’m not the only man. Women talk about us all the time. We’re the ones who are attractive more or less but decline or even recoil from women who aren’t more attractive than we are. This post is just to explore that.

When I think about choosing a potential long term partner, I think back to my mother, who in a better life, I might have looked up to more. As with so much of teaching male gender norms to boys, it really comes down to the idea of settling for less for me. For nearly half of people, settling for less is a relationship that ends in divorce or a life working jobs to keep the food on the table but that never electrify us. When I tell the story of my romantic encounters, what is left unspoken is the enormous lack of such encounters, for years....Years. I think one could certainly say that with such unreasonably high standards, I’ve gone and settled anyway, Mom. 

Dating apps make this so much more cruel and apparent. Why in the world would I date you? Or you, or you, or you? Do y’all really think this low of me that you’d pair me up with people like her?
I never asked these questions before dating apps. 

Prior to covid, I continued to bring up the fact that for the cities built in the US, so many are designed without places of congregation and organic intermingling. So it’s not like I could have found women in person. It’s like they’re perpetually on the other side of town. 

This is where I delete this again. More to come. Add any of your thoughts/ reactions.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ig7c66/im_single_af_but_not_interested_in_you/,Jemiller

2020-08-25 21:03:47,"Let's talk about how men should set healthy boundaries in sex, dating and relationships.","In a recent post [""Why Nice Guys Finish last""](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/ifmxty/why_nice_guys_finish_last/) there were a a lot of great ideas about how men could outgrow both the *Nice Guy* and the *Asshole*. 

A big issue that I had with it and with other similar discussions, is in how we still play into the gendered expectation of the guy being the initiator(we're talking about dating between men &amp; women, generally). It's almost always about how the guys should become better at it. In our case, we try to find a non toxic way to do it. Now, there might be a lot of good reasons for us to frame the discussion in this way. What's problematic, are what we unwittingly enforce while doing so.   
One tragic thing that I see in a lot of guys(and in me as well, from time to time) are that these expectations start to twist and distort anything that they touch; so much so that things like personal boundaries, vulnerabilities, emotional needs, are compromised or broken—when they get in the way of a guys ability to ""perform"". We don't only see this in dating and not just with men, but it's particularly severe in dating and romance. 

The best thing we could do, if we wish to fix this, are societal reforms, that'll take a while. Meanwhile, if we want to help guys out right now, I think we could do a specific thing: Let's teach men how to set personal boundaries and healthy expectations of their partners, **before** we teach them how to become more attractive men. I honestly think that this is something that we just assume that most guys already have, but that's not my lived experience, specially when it comes to how they let women treat them. Once again, the best thing would be for us to teach people to act right. Small steps for now.

I try to live this as much as I can. It has been overall liberating, it has come with some drama as well, I have to admit. The best thing is that I legit think that I can experience some of that feeling of freedom that 'Assholes' seem to possess without feeling like I'm becoming something I'm not.",1.0,1.0,1.0,308.0,/r/MensLib/comments/igbrho/lets_talk_about_how_men_should_set_healthy/,No-Border680

2020-08-26 08:07:51,"Jealousy in relationship, why is it so normalised?","Hey everyone

So I came out of a serious relationship a few months ago. It was the first time I was in a relationship with a woman where we'd discussed marriage and she'd met my parents and I met hers. It ended just before corona started and lockdown gave me the chance to evaluate and process its ending a bit more. The break-up was mutual, it just wasn't working.

One thing I reflected on was my lack of jealousy. I remember being constantly asked by my girlfriend about jealousy and why I didn't feel it. She'd say that me not feeling jealous of another man flirted with her or her flirting with another men was hurtful. I simply couldn't get my head around it though. I hate the language of ""she's mine/he's mine"" as there's no ownership element in a relationship and I'd always say that but it would spark more arguments. If I fully trust someone, why would I be jealous? I consider jealousy to be a negative trait so why is it indulged? Even a friend of mine recently told me it was something I should've felt more. A woman I would be with would be a fully grown woman who'd have agency and is capable of making her own decisions. I trust her so why would I need to be jealous? 
 
It troubled me when this was something my own girlfriend felt. Is it an issue of internalised misogyny? And does jealousy in a relationship have its roots in a patriarchy which states that a woman is the ""possession"" of a man?",1.0,1.0,1.0,127.0,/r/MensLib/comments/igoaew/jealousy_in_relationship_why_is_it_so_normalised/,ZAnderson7

Where the heck is any of that for the guy?

I understand the importance of making a woman feel safe on a date, but how come it's not expected for them to help a guy feel comfortable either?

It feels always expected that I will just be able to get turned on right away and that just isnt true.

I need to feel emotionally safe with a woman before she really turns me on. That's just how it is.

I'd love for a woman to slowly guide me through the sex stuff. To make me feel safe, for a change.

As someone who doesnt have a ton of sexual experience, that would be such a turn on. 

Instead, it feels like it is solely up to me to initiate every damn thing, and frankly...I am tired of it.

Yes, I am all for making a woman feel safe, sexy, and comfortable, but I feel like so many women are not expected to treat guys in the same way. At least not at first.

2020-08-27 18:58:03,Correcting a common misconception about venting and mental health,"This has come up multiple times in this subreddit now: the misconception that it's psychology healthy for people to vent (in particular, venting [misdirected](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/i0bxso/actual_legit_challenges_for_dating_as_a_guy/fzp4v1m/?context=3) frustration at women for men's dating struggles). Not only is this [problematic](https://np.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/igbrho/lets_talk_about_how_men_should_set_healthy/g2ueld3/?context=3) in that it contributes to misogyny and thus [rape culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_culture) (hence, being counterproductive to the stated desire that women initiate more) but it's also psychologically unhealthy for those that engage.

2020-08-28 15:45:40,An Interesting Quote,"From bell hooks' The Will To Change -

""
To heal, men must learn to feel again. They must learn to break the silence, to speak the pain. Often men, to speak the pain, first turn to the women in their lives and are refused a hearing. In many way women have bought into the patriarchal masculine mystique. Asked to witness a male expressing feelings, to listen to those feelings and respond, they may simply turn away. There was a time when I would often ask the man in my life to tell me his feelings. And yet when he began to speak, I would either interrupt or silence him by crying, sending him the message that his feelings were too heavy for anyone to bear, so it was best if he kept them to himself. As the Sylvia cartoon I have previously mentioned reminds us, women are fearful of hearing men voice feelings. I did not want to hear the pain of my male partner because hearing it required that I surrender my investment in the patriarchal ideal of the male as protector of the wounded. If he was wounded, then how could he protect me?

As I matured, as my feminist consciousness developed to include the recognition of patriarchal abuse of men, I could hear male pain. I could see men as comrades and fellow travelers on the journey of life and not as existing merely to provide instrumental support. Since men have yet to organize a feminist men’s movement that would proclaim the rights of men to emotional awareness and expression*, we will not know how many men have indeed tried to express feelings, only to have the women in their lives tune out or be turned off. Talking with men, I have been stunned when individual males would confess to sharing intense feelings with a male buddy, only to have that buddy either interrupt to silence the sharing, offer no response, or distance himself. Men of all ages who want to talk about feelings usually learn not to go to other men.""

Maybe it is subtle. It seemed that the boys and girls in my class were treated in more or less of an equal way.

I know that there's still a stigma on men wearing feminine attire. I've attempted to dress androgynously and got scorn, but not from anyone on the streets but from my own parents. In particular my dad. I feel this double standard exists as I know my female cousins buy clothes from the boys section and their parents allow it but would think the same if my male cousins wanted to dress androgynously.

2020-08-29 00:30:45,Shame and Boys Crying,"I was listening to an episode of Psychology In Seattle recently and [the topic of men not crying](https://youtu.be/eDwsN4hN6cg?t=866) and how that starts  came up. One host described his father being angry at him and explicitly telling him not to cry. The other host recalled that around the age of 5-7 years old he started to notice that you weren't supposed to cry and that many boys his age didn't cry at all and feeling like the ones who didn't were so tough and cool. He continued with another experience on feeling shame the sixth grade from crying from an shocking experience during a game of baseball.


Those experience struck me really hard and I had a similar experience of first having the observation that I was crying and that the rest of the kids and especially the cool kids weren't.
In preschool I never cried, but then in kindergarten, when things started to get bad at home, I cried a few times that year and I felt so judged for it that I told myself I could only do it once a year from then on. And later on in fourth grade me and my friends had a prank go wrong and the principle who was observing the room came and split us up yelled at us on at time and until we were all crying in front of our class and I still have the memory of thinking to myself I will never cry in front of people again. 

Shame, both external and internalized, about crying seems to be fairly universal experience for anyone who was raised male that happens pretty young. I'm curious about the rest of y'all was there a crucial moment in childhood where you decided that you had to stop crying? What was the context and emotions around it?",1.0,1.0,1.0,33.0,/r/MensLib/comments/iiabcs/shame_and_boys_crying/,gameboyadvancedsp2

2020-08-29 12:37:34,Positive masculinity has to be more than oppositional.,"To preface this, what I'm saying is an opinion based on my experience and research. My primary area of expertise is in looking at how people communicate.


There are countless examples of toxic masculinity. Of behaviors and expectations that are causing harm to people. This makes it easy to define a healthy version of masculinity by comparison. To define health by the absence of harm. I strongly believe we shouldn't do that. That while it may be progress, it's not the goal we should be aiming for, the vision of a future we should be believing in.


Let us look for instance, at toxic expectations around emotional vulnerability. The expectation is to suffer in silence. There are a whole bunch of really negative implications to this. Things like how emotional pain from men isn't treated seriously. How men shouldn't offer emotional support, shouldn't learn skills to improve at doing emotional labor. There can be prejudice in fields where emotional labor is required. There's a lot wrong there. But the thing that an oppositional stance misses is that what gives it relevance is that there are some healthy pieces of masculinity that are being co-opted. Speaking as someone that has spent a large chunk of my life dealing with chronic pain, this concept of masculine endurance/persistence has been profoundly helpful. Sometimes the world is just awful, and in order to keep living you have to put one foot in front of the other. To refine this concept: the ability to put your best foot forward regardless of personal circumstance.


Already I can hear the responses about how that too can be negatively applied. And my response to this criticism is very simple: yes, you're right, and that's the point. Enduring pain can be negative if you neglect your health. But sometimes even doing everything right you are still in pain, and you still need to do things. The point is that there are positive, constructive things that can be built off of the premises of toxic masculinity.


But if you don't look that deeply at it, you cede that ground. You reinforce the idea that this persistence belongs in a negatively connotated box. You reinforce that toxic masculinity owns it. I will tell you truly, toxic masculinity is a pretender and a thief, and has no right to any of what it has appropriated for its own uses. When you define in opposition to it, you affirm it's right to what it has stolen from us.



TLDR;

Don't build a mirror. Slaughter the giant and make a garden from it's corpse.

This is especially true for recovering incels or those trying to question their actions on a surface level they see a blanket statement being celebrated one way yet when the script is flipped it's shamed for being a blanket statement.

It's not really acceptable in society to say something like ""men are amazing!"", it would be seen as a slight against women and you'd be corrected and told to say ""people are amazing!"" instead so as not to exclude women. Little boys growing up today will hear negative generalizations like ""men are trash"" but they'd never be told something like  ""men are so inspiring and have provided so much good to the world"".

2020-09-02 06:32:34,So you want to be a man...,"The following was one of my favorite films as a child and it's heartwarming, uplifting, and yet still accommodating to some terrible assumptions of what being ""masculine"" means.  
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZslyHY4quQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZslyHY4quQ) 

Modern (as-in the 20th century) masculinity makes assumptions about being human and being masculine that are both significant contrasts to prior centuries and yet also converges neatly with other \[incorrect\] presumptions of acceptable behavior. According to misogynistic rules, it's not that men should be one way or another to the standard rules, it's that there are things they cannot be and there are things that they have extreme leeway over. 

The ""Modern Man"" was allowed to be both a Mad Man (e.g. like the tv show) and a rough and ready Lumberjack. The error bars for behavior in both directions were egregiously large for men, where they could be allowed utterly primitive behavior in one situation and lack thereof in others. The common denominator to all of this behavior was that it could never be ""soft"" or ""pleasant."" You could love someone, but it had to either be with remote detachment or an animalistic fury. You could hate another, but again it had to follow a schema that could never be classified as ""subdued"" or ""subservient."" In contrast, the presumed archetypal woman had to be subservient to men and could never exhibit anything that might be mistaken as primitive or improper. There were no error bars allowed. This toxic combination of internal and external divisions served to create what is today the worst possible examples for ""how to be a man."" Which is to say, it gives men the privilege to be violently controlling cavemen and no recourse for change. 

So how does one escape this behavior? How does one teach children how to avoid it? The latter is a lot easier than the former, and also helps to inform ways to relearn how to exist in a healthy way. Most importantly, ""how to be a man"" should be re-titled ""how to be a human being,"" because there should be no functional difference between sex or gender in what a healthy baseline should be. 

A baseline, post-modern human should:

* You are human, and so is your neighbor. 
* Understand that fear exists for a reason, but should not rule your life. 
   * Fear of things in the world means you don't understand them and need to take time to assess how you need to interact with them (if at all). It's a tool to help keep you from running ahead of your ability to process the world, not a justification to avoid or harm things. 
* Be able to adapt to new situations. 
   * You should not be so strict in your behavior that you can't navigate social situations as necessary. One group may want you to always interrupt and speak your mind. Another may have rules about how to speak. Both or neither may be fair or unfair, and there are even necessary adaptations for how to modify unfair rules such that everyone can say their peace. 
   * What's most important is that you walk into every situation understanding that you aren't the only face in the room, but nor are you singularly unimportant to it either. 
   * As you learn new things, if they have sound logic, you should incorporate them into your life. Just because you like a habit, doesn't mean it's the best one to keep. 
* Put the work in.
   * You cannot succeed at being manly/womanly/whatever if you don't put sufficient time and effort into what you're doing. This doesn't mean every endeavor requires completion or perfection, but rather you should make sure you put the time into the things you want done and not pretend that 1000 abandoned projects equal one completed one.
* Smart is sexy, but arrogance is not. 
   * What this means is that you should be well-read, willing to learn more, a healthy skeptic, and willing to impart what you know in a way that shows you understand you and the people talking to you are still human. Ask them how best to talk about a subject if it appears there's miscommunication instead of trying to force it in a language or mode where miscommunication will continue. 
* Physical health should never be stylistic and always follow up to date and well-vetted scientific understanding.
   * Fad diets and exercise regimens regularly appear and disappear, up to and including bringing back old beliefs as if they're ""ancient secrets."" Instead of trying to go for quick fixes or secret methods, just know that keeping up with your physical health is important, necessary, and an everyday habit. The manliest man and womanliest woman both have the same secret, they just put the physical exertion and self-control in to stay healthy.
   * Don't ignore diagnostics just because they might be embarrassing. Breast, colon, etc. exams are necessary things to your physical health. 
   * While you shouldn't be so clean as to live in a bubble, maintain your space and body so that it doesn't deteriorate.
* Care first and foremost about utility/functionality and add spice and style on top of it. 
   * Your personal health and wellness should always be more important than style or unnecessary features. 
   * You're allowed to reject an unhealthy style and call it out for what it is. Just because it looks good  or everyone else does it doesn't mean it's good for you. This includes things that a traditional culture may adhere to, including hair styles, body modification, and other behaviors/changes that you're concerned about. 
      * Shaving anything (face, arms, legs, etc) should do no, insignificant, or less harm than not shaving. In an era of wearing facemasks, shaving one's face can be important to the health of those around you. In an era of ever increasing waste, not shaving parts of one's body can be important (to personal health and to the environment).
      * Don't stick to a style if it will be dangerous in the short run. Long hair/beards or nails near machinery is a recipe for disaster. Certain plastic polymers in clothing should never be used near high heat. Clothing that fits too tightly or loosely should be avoided so you don't harm yourself (e.g. skinny jeans/blood flow restrictions or hanging chains/getting caught on random objects).
   * If someone's extremely utilitarian, but still not in an unhealthy way, their lack of fashion is not a crime. Some of the most ridiculous things one can wear are also the healthiest depending on the environment. 
      * On top of a mountain or near large bodies of water, sunscreen may make you look idiotic, but having giant chunks of your face/body removed due to malignant melanoma shows actual idiocy.
* Self-sufficiency and community assistance are two sides to the same coin. 
   * Don't be embarrassed to admit your ignorance and ask for help. If you don't know how to administer your own breast exam, talk to your doctor, a partner, or someone else who knows and can help. If you don't know what a healthy diet is, take the time to learn from health professionals. The same goes for home repair and clothing repair. 
* Be kind.
   * Not nice, not useful, not just not bad...be kind. Help where you can and be empathetic while doing so. This doesn't mean you have to perfectly emulate Fred Rogers, but rather that you should be an overall positive force in your community. You can have a dark sense of humor and still be a kind person (in fact, this may be necessary for some cases of kindness), just remember that it should be adapted to the right time and place.",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ikuj9c/so_you_want_to_be_a_man/,SOL-Cantus
2020-09-02 07:13:50,Why it's bad idea to fixate on r/Nicegirls and other communities that are obsessed with finding examples of women being problematic.,"I don’t think it is mentally healthy to go scrolling through subreddits like r/Nicegirls, or any other community that obsesses over finding endless examples of women making toxic remarks and generalizations about men, or just being awful people in general. I’m not talking about popping in every now and again out of sheer morbid curiosity, I am talking about fixating on these things.

I feel like men find themselves in these communities for a number of reasons. One of them is men who have been hurt, or feel like they can’t talk about a problem that they see, seeking solidarity in other men who observe the problem or have also been hurt. Also, I think fixating on finding different ways that women can be the problem, is also a way of alleviating the feeling that you, as a man, are the sole problem. There is a certain feeling of relief gained when you see women being assholes, a certain reassurance when you see these confirmations that men alone, cannot be the totality of the problem.

Here is the thing, I really don’t think fixating too much on finding awful things women do or say, this is a mentally healthy way of seeking psychological relief and/or solidarity. This is the internet, and if you want to find women spewing awful things about men, you are guaranteed to find an almost limitless amount. Probably more than you could even scroll through in a day. Same thing is true about finding examples of men saying misogynist things about women, if you look for that on the internet, you are certainly going to find more than you can handle. 

The fact that these examples of toxicity are so easy to find on the internet distorts our perception of what is normal and what kinds of beliefs are common in either sex. Finding more and more examples of women being jerks or man-haters, doesn’t give you a clearer picture of what women are like, it just makes you more and more pissed off at and cynical about women. It also reinforces the victim/villain false-dichotomy, and the more you see yourself as the victim of women, the less you will be able to empathize with women. I would argue the exact same thing in reverse too, the more you internalize the perspective that men are the villains, the more damaged your ability to empathize with men in need will be. Ultimately we all want women to be able to empathize with us, right? Okay well that requires us to be able to empathize with them as well, and if you fixate too much on triggering your anger and outrage over the behavior of a minority of women, it is going to damage with your ability to clearly understand the majority of women and their experience.

So if you find yourself in these communities, scrolling through endless of examples of mysandry, you might want to take a second and ask yourself, what exactly are you getting out of this? What exactly are you trying to reinforce and why are you choosing to reinforce it? If all you are getting out of this is more and more anger and feelings of despair toward women. Walk away and don’t look back.  


Tl;dr: While seeking examples of women being problematic can feel good in that it makes men feel less like the problem, it ultimately warps your attitude toward women to a more cynical perspective, which is just not useful. In your quest for self-improvement, seeking clarity should be your goal, not reinforcement of shitty feelings.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ikv92x/why_its_bad_idea_to_fixate_on_rnicegirls_and/,Adymus

2020-09-03 08:53:34,"To all the ""white"" kids out there, a reminder...you're not actually white and that's normal.","According to census documents my wife and I are both white. According to white supremacists she's not white (Jewish) and I am white (Iranian...aka Caucasian...aka \[to them\] ""aryan""). Except, I'm also part Arab...so I'm also semitic...so not white. Except she's part Russian (aka also Caucasian), so she is white...you get the drift.

If you're looking at yourself in the mirror and asking ""what the hell is my culture?!"" you're not alone. If you didn't grow up with a strong sense of cultural identity while others did, ask yourself what their heritage really shows. African-Americans built a cultural identity and can still reference cultures from which their ancestors were taken (e.g. the great many Western African peoples), but they don't represent every single Black culture there. Their heritage shows a struggle to survive and rebuild in the face of violence against their existence. In fact there is no singular ""Black"" peoples culturally. There is a response to other peoples trying to frame them that way; there is a natural, normal, and reasonable rejection to being persecuted for the color of one's skin, but there is no singular culture that defines every single Black person on this planet.

Similarly, Arabs have a wide swath of identities that no single nation can even represent. Asians, Latin-Americans, etc...there is no single people they define themselves by. Instead, we take the best of our heritage and honor it while acknowledging the worst aspects and ways we now avoid them. Even more importantly, you don't have to be proud of every moment in the history of your ancestors. There is no group of humans on earth that can say they represent perfection throughout history; every single one has had individuals or whole tribes full of bad decisions or truly idiotic rulers who survived through sheer luck. 

What then is ""whiteness"" in the grand scheme of things? Well that's actually remarkably easy to say...It's the wrong term, it doesn't exist. Instead of the celebration of any specific skin color, we should rename such supremacy ""angry blandness."" Bland as in things so over-manufactured and oversold to them that it ceases to be any functional culture at all. Angry as in they're angry that they're stuck in such a bland world with only a downward spiral further into stagnation. No one wants to be angry and bland, so there's no need to go out of your way to celebrate living in that world. You're allowed to reject being angry and bland, and give yourself opportunities to define your own community. 

So if you aren't white, then what are you? Well that's your choice. You can build your own heritage or you can look at millenia of ancestral behavior and find those who you can respect. Some of the most studied history in the world belongs to the many distinctive European peoples, which means you have an enormous amount of material from which to better understand where you came from. As long as you don't take cultures and claim them exclusively to yourself, nor pretend that your experiences are the same as those from who you have borrowed, you're at liberty to build as you will. And if you don't like any of those options, there are a myriad of other cultures out there that are happy to share theirs if you're willing to listen and honor their best beliefs. 

Note: To folks whose cultures have been co-opted by Angry Bland Supremacists (Angblanders?), remember that you can represent history without representing hate. If you show equality, empathy, and support for those who are being marginalized, you're taking back your culture against those who would steal it from you.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensLib/comments/iljjef/to_all_the_white_kids_out_there_a_reminderyoure/,SOL-Cantus

2020-09-03 16:04:26,Earning the female gaze and Role Reversal,"A lot of men complain about not feel desirable, or always performing the role of pursuer whilst rarely ever being pursued by the opposite sex and how invalidating that could feel. Yet men have a very limited tool set when it comes to augmenting their desirability to earn the female gaze and how to compel some women to take a more active role in dating. Most men dont even know what appeals to women, due to our deeply patriarchal society that places the male gaze front and centre of our popular culture whilst women are treated as non sexual beings who can never be active agents in pursuing men and are just interested in male utility. The female gaze has rarely been understood. And so men feel lost about what makes them appealing to women, especially if theyre average looking, and what aspects of their features and behaviors they can accentuate to better appeal to women.

 Women have the cosmetic industry, the fashion industry, generations of motherly advice and tons of resources to help them become the object of desire and maneuver through the courting process , which is both disempowering in some ways but empowering and advantageous in other ways too. Theres also the question of toxic masculinity that is preventing many men from openly expressing the need to be the object of desire and fulfilling the passive or non active role in the courting process and not always be the hyper agent/pursuer/""predator"", even if many men feel uncomfortable deep inside being the hyper agent and would like to explore other roles.  

I know this dynamic can be problematic and we should do away with them in a truly gender egalitarian world, but its clear that we are stuck with it for the time being. As a switch, Id love to be courted by a woman and be the object of desire from time to time. And Im trying my best to do what women have done for millennia and increase my own desirability through bodybuilding, great clothing, investing in a skin routine, and Ive even dabbled in male makeup. But I still feel like I have so much to learn about what appeals the female gaze and compelling women to take a more active role in dating and relationships. I mean dating advice for men is either filled with Red pill toxicity or advice that doesnt really work in the real world.  Can any man who has succeeded in partaking in role reversal and earning the female gaze open up about what theyve done and tell us any helpful tips?

2020-09-04 05:32:04,I came across a post in r/raisedbynarcissists by a man who just had what must have been a devastating argument with his parents.,"I don't know who this person is, or anything about the dispute beyond what he provides, but I was really impressed with both [the letter he sent](https://np.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/im0k6e/ive_cut_off_my_parents_i_cant_deal_with_it_any/g3w5dq8/) to his mother afterward, as well as [the letter he didn't send](https://np.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/im0k6e/ive_cut_off_my_parents_i_cant_deal_with_it_any/g3w6gp3/). 

I think he really managed to thread the needle in the former, accepting responsibility for his role in whatever happened while pointing out that he's not the only one in the wrong. In the letter he didn't send, he still accepts some responsibility for his own actions, but presents a damning indictment of the way he's been treated as a boy and a man. He manages to sound mostly calm and reasonable throughout, but he only seemed to really let his anger show when he talked about the way his parents treated his wife.

I think these letters are a good example of a man acknowledging and expressing his emotions to people who have never accepted the validity of his feelings or allowed him to speak his heart and mind.",1.0,1.0,1.0,14.0,/r/MensLib/comments/im2q3f/i_came_across_a_post_in_rraisedbynarcissists_by_a/,asura-emulator

2020-09-06 03:23:37,"Something that happened to me just a couple days ago or, when weeaboo degeneracy goes /r/MensLib/.","So, I have an account on a popular image sharing website where I post random NSFW images I come across on the rest of the internet, most of them being of the weeaboo variety - because it's hard for me to find NSFW images of real people that I appreciate from an aesthetic *and* ethical point of view, and because the kinda shit I'm into is explored in the 2D realm much more often than in the 3D one.

*Anyway*, it doesn't matter if I'm sharing SFW or NSFW stuff, it doesn't matter the website, even, I (as a 28 year old man) am often mistaken for an edgy teenage girl. Cue the guy who decided that sending me several dick pics, garnished with quite a few lewd remarks, was a good idea.

I did of course tell him my age, my gender, *and* that sending dick pics was not cool. We talked for a while and, it totally seemed like he actually, *unironically* thought that dick pics are *exactly* what people of the opposite sex want to see.

Now, several of my female acquaintances and friends are the kind of people who'd feel right at home on a website where the most degenerate kind of weeaboo roams freely, and I've been recommended and shown some straight up kinky manga and fan art by them, but I know for a fact unsolicited dick pics wouldn't do anything for them.

This one guy vehemently disagreed. And just a day later so, basically yesterday, one of those friends sent me some messages from another guy who totally did send them a dick pic, that veered more towards ""this dude sounds like a deranged serial killer"" territory.

Now, I know, I'm a textbook example of high-functioning autism, and I'm quoting my own therapist here, but even my incredibly dense self can see that the way those guys act is bullshit.

2020-09-07 08:31:00,Should women be taught to respect men in the same way that men are taught to respect women?,"It’s no secret that domestic violence is a huge issue for both men and women. There’s a large body of evidence growing that [indicates men and women experience domestic violence in similar proportions](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.6102&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf) and it’s pretty well known that men are likely to [grossly underreport domestic violence cases](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2016001/article/14303-eng.pdf) out of fear for not being believed. 

There is a lot of awareness of men mistreating women, in fact, [there’s a huge bias against men in the way we define sexual assault](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sexual-assault-studies-sexism-men-bias-against-rape-women-gender-florida-atlantic-university-sam-houston-state-university-a7834766.html%3famp) and it’s pretty common place to hear that men should respect women.

From the evidence above, I think it’s clear that there is a need to teach women to respect men in the same way that we emphasize respecting women. 

Usually when I bring up this idea, (especially to other women) I get the answer that women are already taught to not disrespect men, to be quiet, subservient, submissive etc. That is not what it means to respect someone else and only reinforces a relationship model that breeds disrespect between both parties. And if that’s your idea of respect, what does that tell me about what you mean when you say “men should respect women”? 

On a more personal note, I have two sisters and they’re both growing up with the belief that putting men down, humiliating them, and being overall nasty to men is “cute”. They’re both teenagers with little to know dating experience and this is behavior that is also done frequently with teenage boys, BUT there is a worldwide movement against the way teenage boys act but not against the way teen girls act toward males.

Respect is mutual. It’s about treating the other person with dignity and treating them the way you would like to be treated, calling them out on their bullshit in a way that isn’t insulting nor dehumanizing.

2020-09-07 16:24:41,Tonight I got to give the gift of crying to my friend who hasn't cried in a decade.,"I want to tell the story of how I helped my friend cry tonight but I want to give some context.

We've been friends for 20 years and we've always talked about how frustrated we both were in the ways that our friendships with men often go. We would commiserate that we didn't have enough physical contact, enough sweetness, enough vulnerability and lots of other things so we decided to move in together and be and give those things to each other.

Well it's been great, well watch shows on the couch and just have our shoulders together or drape arms over each other and it's been really really great.

I want to be clear, it's not common for big tall straight guys like us to have the opportunity to do stuff like this with other male friends. It is literally alien and unwelcome for most of the men we both know.

And tonight I got to do something I never even thought of doing in my life.

My friend is going through a really tough time and hes just been building up stress for months about this thing going on. 

We spoke about it and he mentioned he wished he could cry and told me he hadn't cried except for eyes watering for a half second in 10 years!

I asked him to put his head on my lap and I rubbed my fingers through his hair and I stroked his cheek and I told him he was safe and that I was there and protecting him and he could relax and I was taking care of him.

I remembered my mother doing this for me when I was a teenager and I'd bawl my goddamn eyes out.

After a few minutes he went quiet and then I heard him sobbing and he got up immediately and thanked me and I told him he didn't need to get up and I could see he was confused so I gently put him back in my lap and he just sobbed more for like 20 minutes and then he told me he felt better and went to take a nap in his room.

Look I'm not trying to toot my own horn here, I'm just sharing because some other guy out there right now might need to hear that were allowed to do this for each other. We are allowed to create spaces where our brothers can be safe and vulnerable.

It felt like he had been strong and protective for so long and in that space I was able to convince his body that I was protecting it, that it was safe in my arms with me on the lookout and he was safe to rest and cry.

I'm 40 years old. Ive never gotten that kind of feeling from any man, only my mother and from girlfriends, and tonight I got to give that to a man who is a brother in my heart.

I don't know if this is worthwhile as a story. I've wanted for so long to be a part of some small shift in how men are and tonight I really felt like I got to see something that felt different to how I saw men told to be.

I hope someone gets something out of this.

2020-09-07 18:02:15,Old Friends and their apparent habbits,"I met up with some friends recently due to the last of them becoming a father recently. We all have children and wifes, I meet seem pretty seldom, at least once a year, but rarely more often.

Conversations are pretty much about trips they did, often about woman. Not their wifes, woman they hooked up with and how to hook up. I know that they are not faithful to their wifes, but that is something between them and their wifes. It seems they are ok with it, because they are not trying to hide that very good, they have to know.
  
This time the discussion was, if it would be a good idea to rent a 12 person yacht for 8k/day in order to anchor in front of a beach and get girls from the beach to the yacht by tender in order to get laid. They are six people who are going on vacation once a year together. One guy suggested, that getting prostitutes for 1,3k per person daily would be better since nobody had to relay on luck/additional cost to make the girls from the beach happy (i.e. ""We need a barkeeper to supply cocktails or something"") in order to get laid and for 1,3k you can get really pretty girls who know what they are doing and have an overall better experience then some girl from the beach. And you don't have to ask for their age.

I was pretty baffled by this conversation to say the least. I mean I knew they are not the most faithful bunch, but that kind of planning was quite the shock.
A little bit disgusted but also a little fascinated how much they seem to be needing to have sex with other woman.
Their wifes are not ugly by any standard and I can't really understand why they are doing that.

2020-09-07 23:30:33,Retrospective on the now dead Peter Pan syndrome-debate.,"I had a realisation the other day, and I'd like to test my idea with you if that's alright.

Remember how a decade back there were a lot more debates going on about men not leaving their ""childhood attributes"" and women were complaining in the media about men not growing up. Computer games were especially targeted but it could also be lots of other things, a guy keeping his Lego or figurine collections, still avidly following their media directed primarily to juvenile audiences and so forth. I guess also: sinking time into fun, but not particularly useful, activities with your male friends also accounted for this so called Peter Pan syndrome.

But then the talk suddenly died down and I think I may know the reason for it.

This was a generational thing. This was the last generation who grew up with guy and girl interests held strictly separate, where no young boy wanted to invite any girls into sharing that which he had with his male friends. Now, those interests and hobbies have evolved, and nostalgia is ever marketable, but I can see now why that snarky debate took place. There was a certain sadness behind it. Peter Pan who never invited Wendy.

At the time, I probably reacted like any not-so-thoughtful male netizen would with ""Oh yeah, but honey, you can shove your Martha Stewart crap, dinner parties and whatever ""super valid"" interests YOU have that I don't care a shit about, and I'll keep playing WoW over here..."", but that wasn't really it, was it? 

Now it has changed for the better I think. Now young boys and girls actually share interests growing up, more and more. Now it's accepted that ""You're never too old to play""(within reason). Even my office has a gaming pit. 

Still feel a bit sorry for that generation which is now what? In their 40-50s? All the excluded women, and all the men hiding away the barely tolerated stuff they love in the basement or garage.

2020-09-09 03:45:03,"Life as a ""Step Dad in Training""","I'll start by saying this: I'm 20 years old and I am dating a single mom. Here, it's not hard to say. But in the rest of the world, I've heard it all.

I started dating her around 4-5 months ago. I am a non-judgement type, and after dating some really really toxic and immature people, I knew I cared more about how they treated me over ""status"". So when I saw ""Single Mom"" in her bio at first I was a little nervous, but I decided to give her a chance.  

And boy am I glad I gave her a chance. This girl is my world. She is the sweetest, most considerate, and strongest woman I have ever met. I mean, she outshines my own Mom in so many areas of character development, kindness, maturity etc. Like, she is the most mature and collected person I know, even she's she's stressed out. And she is a year younger than me. She had her world rocked in high school yet still manages to squeeze more joy out of life than most people I know.

And as for her daughter, I am blown away. I've been able to watch her grow these past months and each day I fall more and more in love with the two of them. Her daughter stood up on her own in front of me. She took her first steps towards me, and yesterday, she said her first word. I was feeding her, and she wasn't interested anymore. This little tyke looks me dead in the eye and says ""No"" while shaking her head. I sat there stunned for like 5 minutes while she smashed her banana. To put it plainly, I'm a little addicted to parenting. 

However not everyone is a non-judgement type. And it's been hard. I am a music major. I am emotional, and draw on this emotion to compose. So I've heard stuff like ""How are you going to provide as a musician?!"" or ""Wow, were you desperate or something?"", and the most common ""Oh. That's nice"" (With visibly uncomfortable body language)

It's been hard. But over time, I have realized that it isn't worth worrying about. Because people who judge you for dating a single mom... Fuck em. I don't need those kinds of people in my life.

I wouldn't trade what I have for anything else. Never in my life did I think I would be a father before my older siblings. But as the saying goes ""You make plans, and God laughs""

&gt;  
&gt;Masculinity is strong. he acts. he is hairy.  
&gt;  
&gt;Masculinity is as ugly as he is handsome, as brave as he is foolhardy, and as genius as he is dumb.  
&gt;  
&gt;Masculinity is as disposable as he is vital.  
&gt;  
&gt;Masculinity is this intangible feeling of belonging I only felt conscious of when I felt shame for lacking him. I still don’t know what being masculine is 100%, but it’s certainly not feminine. And no matter how aware I am of it and consciously subvert it, I still feel shame for not living up to it. It’s armor and coffin wrapped in gunmetal grey, and a storm I’ll never stop chasing. ""

2020-09-13 08:34:14,"Men with more than one cultural background, what's your observation of different paradigms of masculinity?"," I am in a curious position because I have observed two different cultural conceptions of masculinity through my life: The one from my natal country (which is also my mother’s), and the one from my father's country. Although both countries are latin-american, they have noticeably different views and I am going to describe them generally in my words and experience.

There are things both cultures have in common. They are both corrective in their expectations; one follows the script or one is stared at, chastised, isolated or even gets aggression, depending on how “grave” one’s “deviation” is. Unsurprisingly, both are homophobic, except on different ways and on different behaviors. In my native country, that homophobia is subtle, mocking and insidious; contrasting to the one in my father’s country, where judgement is more direct and with disgust.

Where I live there is an obvious script, an image of what “A Real Man” is. It has regional variations but there is a general idea: Extroverted, bragging, a flirt, not vain, physically strong, commanding, provider, he demands respect, is quick to fight, drinks hard and is never sensitive or weak. 

On the other side, my father’s culture is less prescriptive and more ""avoidant"" of homosexuality. Anything like that is something “wrong”, something one should not do. For example: makeup, women’s clothes, some mannerisms, softness or being too close (physically or emotionally) to another man.

All of this becomes strange and kind of funny once I consider the way I fit in them. In general terms: I am quiet and not aggressive, I’m conscientious and organized, sensitive but very reserved; I’m not gay but I’ve always been single and I’m too independent and weird to be a “family guy”; I don’t have feminine mannerisms and dress like a metalhead. 

Which means: if I used my father’s culture as measurement, I would be within the masculine expectations, because I don’t have any “homosexual behaviors”. But if I used my country’s expectations, then I would be half outside, because I’m not an assertive extroverted Don Juan. Wack, isn’t it?.

To exemplify it I can tell a couple of anecdotes:

My mom once asked me if I was gay, because I don’t date and haven’t had a girlfriend, while my dad doesn’t mind that as long as I’m a responsible worker/student.

On the other hand my dad once got weird because I went to the movie theater only with one male friend, while my mom didn’t mind that because here that is not strange at all.

\---

Even here, in the internet and in hollywoodian media (the most frequent here) I notice that cultural contrast. Since many are from the U.S. I have noticed the differences in the conceptions around masculinity.

To others that have been in multicultural situations like this, what have you observed?",1.0,16.0,0.95,9.0,/r/MensLib/comments/irob66/men_with_more_than_one_cultural_background_whats/,operaoscura
2020-09-13 09:57:10,"Evoking the ""female gaze"" and reducing toxic masculinity through role reversal?","A lot of men complain about not feel desirable, or always performing the role of pursuer whilst rarely ever being pursued by the opposite sex and how invalidating that could feel. Yet men have a very limited tool set when it comes to augmenting their desirability to earn the female gaze and how to compel some women to take a more active role in dating. Most men dont even know what appeals to women, due to our deeply patriarchal society that places the male gaze front and centre of our popular culture whilst women are treated as non sexual beings who can never be active agents in pursuing men, unless theyre low value ""sluts"" and are just interested in male utility. The female gaze has rarely been understood. And so men feel lost about what makes them desirable to women, especially if theyre average looking, and what aspects of their features and behaviors they can accentuate or change to better appeal to women. Toxic redpill culture is flourishing because of this. 

 Women have the cosmetic industry, the fashion industry, generations of motherly advice and tons of resources to help them become the object of desire and maneuver through the courting process , which is both disempowering in some ways and places the desiree in a vulnerable position. But its also empowering and advantageous in other ways too. Theres also the question of toxic masculinity that is preventing many men from openly expressing the need to be the object of desire and fulfilling the passive or non active role in the courting process and not always be the hyper agent/pursuer/""predator"", even if many men feel uncomfortable deeply inside about always being the hyper agent and would like to explore other roles.  Some men cant fullfill that role because of changing economics that is making it harder for men to earn a decent wage and perform the role of a pursuer with a healthy bank account whos able to be appealing via socio economic status. 

I know this dynamic can be problematic and we should do away with them in a truly gender egalitarian world, but its clear that we are stuck with it for the time being. As a switch, Id love to be courted by a woman and be the object of desire from time to time. And Im trying my best to do what women have done for millennia and increase my own desirability through bodybuilding, great clothing, investing in a skin care routine, and Ive even dabbled in male makeup. But I still feel like I have so much to learn about what appeals to the female gaze and compelling women to take a more active role in dating and relationships since this is the first year(and a half) Ive actually put effort into this, despite the fact that this issue is has been on my mind for many years. I mean dating advice for men is either filled with Red pill toxicity or advice that doesnt really work in the real world.

  Can any man who has succeeded in partaking in role reversal or evoked the female gaze open up about what theyve done and tell us any helpful tips? Are there any good resources too? And to women here, what makes certain men or your partner evoke raw desire in you?",1.0,16.0,0.8,259.0,/r/MensLib/comments/irpklx/evoking_the_female_gaze_and_reducing_toxic/,wazzoz99

2020-09-14 08:37:12,How to unlearn sexual racism/colorism?,"I would like to apologize in advance for the potentially offensive nature of this post. I recognize that it will be trying for some people to see a person of such privilege openly discussing their biases, and I don’t blame you if you don’t want to engage with this post as a result. However, I know that I am not the only person with this problem, and I’m pretty sure I’m not alone in wanting to know how to solve it. So here it goes.

I am a 22-year old straight White cis male living in the United States, and I believe that I have racist and/or colorist tendencies in my sexual preferences. I have always occupied extremely diverse spaces (neighborhoods, schools, friend groups, workplaces, etc.), and the people I’ve been attracted to in the past have reflected this diversity; to paraphrase Gabriel Iglesias, I’ve liked the rainbow. With one exception: I rarely find myself romantically attracted to Black women. I seem to be just as capable of finding Black women attractive in a more abstract, distant, purely aesthetic way, in the same way that you might be able to know that someone is good-looking despite the fact that they’re “not your type”. But when it comes to finding Black women romantically attractive, feeling for them the sort of attraction that might make me want to pursue a relationship with them, I seem to have a lot of trouble. In fact, the only Black woman I can remember feeling that sort of romantic attraction for had very light skin and features that very much conformed to Eurocentric beauty standards.

This is especially striking given the nature of my sexuality. Though I am only romantically attracted to women and hence on the “straight” end of the heterosexual-homosexual axis, my sexuality differs from what is often (toxically) considered normative in that I almost never feel romantically attracted to people with whom I do not already have a relationship. Casual sex with someone I don’t know is utterly unappealing to me; the most I can do with strangers is appreciate them in that abstract, aesthetic way, from afar, and even this can be hard for me before I know someone well. I’ve often had the experience of not finding someone aesthetically attractive at all until I get to know them, at which point they (quite unexpectedly!) become romantically and sexually attractive to me. In other words, on the allosexual-asexual axis, I am somewhere in the middle, a position I think is best described by the term “demisexuality”. I mention this because a large number of my close friends are Black women, and despite finding many of them quite aesthetically beautiful it is statistically pretty shocking that as I’ve gotten to know each of them better I’ve never gone on to find one of them romantically attractive.

I have become more concerned about this recently, as a few months ago I entered a very serious relationship with a woman I can envision myself spending a long time with, who is half-White and half-Korean. On one hand, I worry about the prospect of introducing her to my friends who are Black women, since I fear that I will hurt them if they begin to perceive me as a White man who is woke enough to befriend many Black women but not woke enough to date one. But on the other, it really is true that my romantic/sexual preferences reflect racism/colorism! I even worry that my romantic attraction to my current girlfriend is in some sense less genuine, since it wasn’t weighed against the romantic attraction I might have had toward my Black friends were I not racist/colorist in this way.

Are there any ways to begin to unlearn racist/colorist romantic/sexual preferences? Right now there are a lot of slideshows circulating on Instagram and other platforms raising awareness of colorism, but when they get to their “Solutions” slide they often seem to fall flat: one popular slideshow encourages viewers to “acknowledge that some of the things you do or say may be colorist”, to “call colorist people out”, and to “recognize/address colorism in schools, workplaces, media, etc.” Similarly, I’ve encountered many blog posts and articles on this subject that implore men to shed their colorist preferences, to stop seeing women with lighter skin as more feminine, to escape from the socially constructed denigration of Black women. But I have seen no discussion in these sorts of resources on *how to do that*, how to actually purge oneself of these harmful preferences, how to get from the stage of acknowledgement and shame to the stage of being free of these prejudices. I acknowledge that this is problematic, that it is harmful, but where can I go from here? Is it even possible to change one’s sexual preferences after puberty? (Everything I’ve read on the subject suggests that sexual preferences are set at a very young age, and I’ve never read anything about intentionally changing them other than the obviously ineffective practice of conversion therapy for homosexual people.) Or am I simply doomed to retain this biased tendency – and are the Black women around me doomed to remain less romantically attractive in my eyes?

Guidance would be greatly appreciated on this subject, and answers that discuss fighting colorism outside the context of the specific context of my situation are of course welcome, as sexual racism/colorism does not limit itself to expression through the straight White American male gaze. Apologies again for the sensitive nature of this post. Hopefully whatever discussion it engenders will be helpful to others, too.

(One thing I realized I forgot to include in this that I'll add here as a postscript: the podcast *This American Life* did once brush against this issue, in an episode called [""Tell Me I'm Fat""](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/589/transcript), when the writer/comedian/activist Lindy West discusses her experience overcoming fatphobia. ""I remember feeling like my brain was changing shape. \[... I remember looking at\] fat rolls and arm fat and bellies and staring at them and saying, OK, what if I found that objectively beautiful?"" West says. ""And then does that work?"" asks the interviewer. ""Yes it does,"" West responds. ""At least, it worked for me.""

Perhaps for some people unlearning racism/colorism will be as easy as unlearning fatphobia was for West, but for me this strategy has not been successful. After all, as I said, it is not as though I cannot recognize beauty in Black women, but the *je ne sais quoi* of that romantic spark is absent for me, and it's not something I've ever been able to will into existence, whether for the purpose of unlearning racism/colorism or any other.)",1.0,1.0,1.0,56.0,/r/MensLib/comments/isaekf/how_to_unlearn_sexual_racismcolorism/,yall_kripke

2020-09-16 11:51:39,Straight erasure in history????,"Apologies for the facetious title. I'll be a little more serious. 

To get to the point, I've been seeing a lot of memes, specifically based around ancient history, about how gay or bisexual certain figures were. Achilles and Patrokles, or Alexander and Hephaestion, are two obvious examples. R/Sapphoandherfriend is a subreddit basically dedicated to it. 

First, I want to say that I totally understand people who are not straight, white men searching for figures in ancient history to connect to. I am a straight white man who has done it quite a lot. 

But I think that this meme may be a little overreaching. First, most historians in history did not make these assumptions. It's really only the Nazi, or racial ideology-leaning historians who looked at an ancient conquerer and decided that guy must have been a perfect Aryan. 

Second, I think automatically assuming two same-sex figures who share a close bond *must* be gay is really jumping the gun. To use the Alexander and Hephaestion example - I'm sure there probably was some sexuality between them, that's not a field I'm super familiar with, but the two guys were incredibly skilled soldiers who fought and shared hardship together for years. To me, that sounds like the love shared between comrades, the kind of love that would drive a soldier to do incredibly dangerous things to save his friend. It doesn't sound like Alexander wanting to lose his sex buddy. Same goes for Achilles and Patrokles, or other people similarly sharing close bonds.

2020-09-16 21:10:47,"I want to protest injustices that men face in my country, but I don't know what to do.","For context, I live in Switzerland. Keep in mind that many sources that I'll post will be in German.

&amp;#x200B;

In the recent years, we've experienced many protests of different kinds (Women's Marches, BLM Protests, etc.), but there hasn't really been any protests of similar size for men. 

The same goes for where I live, Switzerland. There has been Women's marches and BLM Protests, but when it came to Protests for Men's Rights, for lack of a better term, there has been zero. (out of convenience I'll refer to Protests for Men's Rights as Men's Marches from here on.)

The general consensus around whether we should organize Men's Marches or not is ""Well, nobody's stopping you from organizing a Men's March, why don't you make one?""

So I thought, fine. Let's make one then.

But now I've hit a wall. From looking into previous Men's Marches, they've always been shouted down as alt-right gatherings and got counter-protested to hell. Considering the horrible reputation Men's Marches already tend to have, there's also the question of ""who the f--- would even want to join a Men's March?"" 

The obvious answer would be ""well, march with feminists!"". While not technically a bad answer, one would face an entirely different set of problems there. Because first of all, one would immediately be accused of trying to derail women's issues because they brought up men's issues in a feminist protest. Second of all, considering most people attending the feminist protests would be attending because they want to (rightfully so) protest women's issues, someone protesting men's issues would just be drowned by the absolute sea of people protesting women's issues.

Considering groups caring about men's issues are almost non-existant in Switzerland, I have no idea who I could talk to.

What I want to do with these protests is to raise awareness about the issues that men face and hopefully gain enough support to solve them altogether, one day. These Men's Marches would likely take place around International Men's Day (around November 19th).

As for the issues that men face in Switzerland, there are the following:

[Mandatory military conscription for all Swiss men.](https://www.ch.ch/en/performing-compulsory-service/) I for one am not yet a Swiss citizen, but I'd like to be one day. But if I apply for citizenship, I'd have to either go to the military every year until I'm 37, do civil defense service every year, pay a tax which makes up 3% of my annual income (or at least CHF 400), or go to prison. I don't want to do military service or civil defense service that women don't have to do, neither do I want to pay a tax that women don't have to pay. So since I can't apply for citizenship unless I do one of the above, I won't be able to vote. On top of that, there's recently been a bunch of scandals in the army ([up to 190 recruits getting food poisoning](https://www.blick.ch/politik/lebensmittelvergiftung-in-armee-jetzt-ermittelt-die-justiz-id15457654.html) in one barracks, [recruits collapsing and dying during marches](https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/grenadierschule-in-isone-rekrut-stirbt-bei-leistungsmarsch), etc.).

[Higher retirement age for men.](https://www.ch.ch/en/retirement-age/) Sure, one could retire earlier, but it will reduce the pension you'll get from the state.

[No paternity leave.](https://www.ch.ch/en/paternity-leave/) Maternity leave in Switzerland is [already horrible](https://www.blick.ch/news/wirtschaft/mickriger-mutterschaftsurlaub-die-schweiz-steht-bei-der-elternzeit-hinten-an-id15167860.html) compared to most other countries (14 weeks at most, while other countries (i.e. Sweden) have up to **80 weeks of combined parental leave**). On September 27th, 2020 there's a referendum, where Swiss citizens will be able to vote whether or not the country should implement a mandatory parental leave, [however that parental leave is only two weeks long.](https://www.vaterschaftsurlaub.ch/)

[Men, by law, cannot be raped in Switzerland.](https://www.swissinfo.ch/ger/strafrecht_maenner-koennen-in-der-schweiz-nicht-vergewaltigt-werden/44391718)

[About one in five people seeking support in domestic violence in Switzerland are men, while one in four people convicted of domestic violence in Switzerland are women](https://www.luzernerzeitung.ch/schweiz/wenn-manner-plotzlich-opfer-werden-ld.1070408) (keep in mind the number of unreported cases is likely much higher!). Places which help men in domestic violence cases are still minimal. [There's only about three men's shelters for domestic violence in the entire county.](https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/schweiz/maennerhaus-leiterin-beide-seiten-haben-anteil-am-konflikt-133722338)

On top of that there's the higher [suicide rate for men](https://www.obsan.admin.ch/de/indikatoren/suizid), among other issues.

[Men as primary school teachers are highly underrepresented](https://www.maenner-an-die-primarschule.ch/), which leads to a lack of male role models for the students. On top of that, boys are frequently treated as defective girls at school and often punished more harshly (I've experienced this first-hand throughout school).

There's other topics, like men not showing their emotions, sexual harassment, violence in general against men etc., but these are the topics that came to mind (in Switzerland alone).

I've recently been at a podcast about men's issues and discussed this very thing, but I wanted to expand upon the topic here. What we'll be discussing will probably be mostly about Switzerland, but I think whatever advice I'll get here can also be useful for people in other countries, who want to organize protests highlighting men's issues.

2020-09-17 03:30:58,Where do trafficked men go for help?,"I volunteer with a loosely organized coalition that provides harm reduction supplies, food, and wound care for the unsheltered, sex working, and drug using populations of my mid-sized-to-large American city. One of the populations we prioritize highest is sex workers, because of their limited ability to access traditional and institutional resources. (Aka the pimps hate us less than the social workers and will sometimes actually let us treat their abscesses).

Last month, a man at one of the camps we visit asked for help. Let’s call him Liam. Liam is an unaffiliated (aka not being trafficked or beholden to a pimp) sex worker. But for a few days now a pimp had been following him, and at one point even chased him down the street. We’re all pretty sure the pimp was trying to abduct him and traffic him.

This isn’t an unfamiliar situation to us, we’ve helped many women get into shelters and will often times make phone calls and press people and be annoying until a bed appears in a safe house.

But we’ve never helped a man being pursued like this before. Usually adult male sex workers are unaffiliated and engaging in survival sex work. And when they are trafficked, there’s usually a legal or financial dependency on their abuser, not a physical threat like abduction. (Only in our coalition’s experiences, I can’t extrapolate outside the populations we serve).

So we did our standard operating procedures and went looking for a sex worker or domestic violence shelter that could take him. But we ran into a wall. They were all for women and children. Lots of women’s shelters and youth shelters were available, but they didn’t accept men. Even our favorite org to send sex workers to is specifically for trafficked women and children. 

This city is one of the human trafficking epicenters of the nation, and yet no one was helping the male victims! I eventually said screw it, and was going to tell Liam that he should claim to be a pre-op transgender woman and go to one of the LGBT friendly women’s shelters.

Luckily, however, when we started making calls and explained the situation, the shelter for trafficked women and children made an exception for him. We haven’t seen Liam since, so we’re praying that means he got help and got safe. (We’re pretty sure he’s not dead though, the coroner helps our coalition and lets us know when someone matching one of our missing is found).

But you shouldn’t need an exception to get help as a male victim of trafficking! The existence of women’s shelters and youth shelters is important, but there needs to be more resources and help for men who are trafficked.

2020-09-19 09:27:18,As if,"This post talks about a rather severe scenario and the surrounding views, but I believe these same biases affect the treatment of men more generally, and so this is part of a broad problem.

Sometimes I see sentiments conveyed, either explicitly or implicitly, that I [a man] don’t have much to worry about from street violence or the like.  Sometimes it’s a general discussion of men, sometimes it’s a small discussion with friends, and so pertains to me specifically.  Either way, the idea is that, as a man, I could just fight off attackers or something.  These views always bother me, because they thrust upon me the role of the strong stoic man, who can fend for himself without any support, and who is familiar with violence.

&amp;nbsp;

As if I could bring myself to commit violence, even in defense  (I don't want to find that out).

As if I wouldn’t freeze up when threatened.

As if I’m not every bit as afraid for my life in a dangerous situation.

As if my body isn’t every bit as vulnerable to fists, knives, and guns.

As if men aren’t the predominant victims of violent crime.

As if a bystander would come to my aid as often as they might for a woman.

As if I haven't been stalked, assaulted, and raped.

&amp;nbsp;

I have no problems admitting that I can be weak in this context.  Well, I’m probably an average strength man, but I am definitely not a confident fighter.  That role should not be painted in broad strokes over the vulnerable walk of life of almost all people, men and women alike.  **Being afraid of violence is not cowardice in a man, it is typical of being human.**  I wish society would allow for men more empathy, which is often incongruous with the brutish framing we are often seen through.",1.0,1.0,1.0,55.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ivj1um/as_if/,DiamondGP

2020-09-19 13:59:34,Justifying our space,"I was catching up on the last few days of posts on MensLib when something stuck out to me amongst the comments. I noticed that even in a place designed to talk about mens issues people seemed to give caveats and justifications during their discussions. 

Things like: 
""Men experience problem X, not to understate what women go through""
or ""men have a lot of privileges but they also face issue Y""

This stood out to me because I have struggled with low self-worth most of my life. I've developed a habit of justifying and over-explaining myself as a result and it's a tough habit to break. 

With my background those comments stuck with me. It strikes me as odd because it seems like a male-centric space such as this shouldn't *need* these justifications. It reeks to me of shame, that to advocate for men in good conscience we first have to prove that we're ""one of the good ones"".

But maybe I'm projecting on this issue. It seems like this habit could serve to help keep discussions grounded and prevent this community from slipping towards the worst tendencies of other ""men-centric communities"" (I hesitate to say misogyny because there's a lot more problems but that one is definitely the most prominent).

2020-09-19 23:42:12,Purity Politics,"Purity politics has a double meaning - one in the leftist activist spheres and another in the conservative religious ones - and this is an active frustration with the former. Some people like calling it cancel culture, but I prefer purity culture - because it is a direct mirror of the religious conservative culture that declares that as soon as a person (a woman) is impure (sexual) she is to be shunned.

&amp;#x200B;

First off, to maintain honesty, this has been sitting with me for a while and I'm posting this morning because I am being absolutely *dragged* right now on other social media for publicly mourning Ruth Bader Ginsberg because her history wasn't perfect. That said, I think this is very much a men's liberation problem as well as a larger movement problem.

&amp;#x200B;

I have long been exhausted by the idea that ""your fave is problematic"" and the idea that any past faux pas is a reason to shun a person, expel them from a group, and question their current ""wokeness."" If nothing else, it shuts down the concept of human growth that I find integral to you know, being human.

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen this applied to men in very specific ways - notably, the idea that if a man has ever done anything seen as vaguely misogynist, he cannot be trust 10 or 15 years later. (I do not mean that rapists should not be charged for their crimes, which I have been accused of in feminist spaces. I am a victim of rape and the majority of rapists are never charged - if justice can be had, it should be.) This is also applied to trans men in some strange timeline manipulations - some arguments are seen as potentially volatile-to-benign coming from women but outright dangerous coming from men (ie a friend who has a preference for his partners to be waxed or shaved - this was seen as a bit of a fetish before he transitioned and afterward, was accused of being a pedofile by the wlw community). 

&amp;#x200B;

It's also a danger to our radicalized brethren. I am not a fan of Red Pill or incel culture, but I want them to grow as people and I need them to have a space in liberation. I worry about the incel or Red Pill bro who is thinking about leaving and then sees me - a gay trans anarchist - being called a racist transphobic misogynist for publicly mourning RBG and (rightly) assuming that because they were an incel in the past, there is no space for them in the liberation movement. The assumption that one mistake, or a history of bad politics makes them irredeemable. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's an assumption of both the inability for human growth (calling out a tweet from 2011) and an assumption that a disagreement means automatic cancellation. (This goes in both directions actually. I was also dragged on social media for critiquing Kamala Harris when she was nominated because ""you really just can't celebrate black women, can you?"") It's the shut down of any dialogue but the ""correct"" dialogue for the dominant members of whatever group you were in. Or in a space where I was earlier this month where a moderator said we couldn't talk about any trans issues because ""There are no black trans women and they are the highest priority and most marginalized, so we cannot discuss trans issues without them."" Hi, I'm a white disabled trans man and my issues are also a real thing and unlikely to be addressed if we are only talking about trans issues regarding trans women.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a unique position where I grew up in a very politically connected family and, while I am a gay trans anarchist today, I have had personal insight into how the sausage gets made. The day Schoolhouse Rock taught me how a bill becomes a law, my dad took us aside and told us that was wrong - first a man at a cocktail party writes a generous cheque. Politics is very much a dirty business of figuring out what your priorities are (and some people and causes, unfortunately, won't make the list) and learning to make trade offs that are more Faustian than you would like. 

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, I think that's a better system than purity. In a Faustian political world, an incel can learn liberation, a neo-Nazi can come out as queer, my prioritizing of trans issues doesn't mean that I can't be in a space with your issues prioritizing issues as an immigrant or man of color or Muslim in America. We'd be trading off in some ways that are morally gross, but it's not completely shutting down conversation and shunning people, as is the norm in purity culture.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, gross behavior that doesn't violate the ""dialogue"" is often allowed in these spaces, especially actions that violate the perceived oppressor or majority. In this, I recall strongly being in a support group space and a trans man talking about how much he enjoyed watching men at public urinals. When I pointed out that this is sexually violative behavior, most of the group tried to shut me down because, well, it's just cis men at urinals. But that's the very behavior that the conservative Right is trying to legislate us out of bathrooms because it is sexually violative. But because it was against cis men, it was not seen as violative (in an activist anarchist space).

&amp;#x200B;

This was an essay and I thank you for reading it. I want a better space. A better world. This culture is what continually drives me out of activist and liberation spaces. My politics are usually ""pure"" and, apart from being a racist misogynistic transphobe for mourning RBG, I haven't really been cancelled, per se. But I have seen people who are and it makes me uncomfortable to be in those spaces. I don't want people to be cancelled; I want people to grow.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ivuus5/purity_politics/,grayperegrine

2020-09-20 01:59:36,Dating somebody new is showing me how rare it is to actually feel my masculinity understood and appreciated,"I wanted to share this anecdote with you all because I feel like it's already teaching me a lot about what masculinity really is or can be. I've spent a lot of time on this sub, in my own head, and other places seeing masculinity completely deconstructed. Frankly I have been wondering if it's really relevant at all any more, or whether it's an archaic framework that takes severe mental gymnastics to healthily adapt to a modern understanding of gender and sexuality. And while those questions aren't necessarily settled for me now, I feel like this experience is clarifying a lot and opening up new avenues of thought, and I thought some people here might appreciate it.

____________________________


So, I started seeing this girl recently. I hadn't had sex with anyone in a bit over a year due to a variety of factors, largely the triple combination of refusal to use dating apps, difficulty integrating into a new city after moving cross country, and the good old 'rona fucking over any progress I had made on the former after months of work. I finally bit the bullet and redownloaded tinder and bumble after I realized that fantasizing about everybody I passed in my car or handed my credit card at REI was making me a bit uncomfortable with who I was starting to become. Needless to say it was pretty miserable, but I got lucky and got a decent match inside a few weeks. 

The conversation started with a haiku battle that gave me a instinctual sense of who she was and how she thought pretty quickly. That is to say, I felt a sort of commonality that was strengthened as we started talking about what we were looking for and sharing a bit about our backgrounds. There was a sort of unspoken mutual understanding that we were pretty much compatible and almost certainly going to date; this made talking about our sexual preferences, even more long-term ones that require some trust, exciting. Meeting in person was a little weird, as it always is, and definitely reinforced my distaste for the apps. I know if we had even a modicum of in-person interaction to go off of we would have had a better feel for each other before the first date and there'd be less awkwardness (masks REALLY didn't help). But now a few dates in she's pretty much warmed up to me, the connection between who she over text and irl has solidified, and we've started fully settling into the connection we sensed off the bat we would have.

**(end of dumb shit you probably don't care about)**

When we first started getting physical after a few dates, I noticed a difference between her and girls I've been with in the past. I'm no stranger to having my hair stroked or my neck kissed or anything like that, little spoon type shit, but it usually happens with long-term partners and even then pretty rarely. It's not something I want to have to ask for, and even when I make it clear that I'm into it they sort of treat it like a rare treat when they're feeling overwhelmingly affectionate or protective or whatever the word is. Before this girl it hadn't ever entered the normal flow of my sex life in a stable way.

I'm a mostly dominant person by nature, but I do have a bit of switchiness I guess you would say. This girl describes herself as a switchy sub, which makes us perfect fits. The way our dynamic shakes out (even in just making out or cuddling or something), is I find myself starting off in this role that's a little more macho. I'm looking down at her, I'm holding her head in my hands, wrapping my arms around her, etc. You know what I'm talking about here, feeling muscular, feeling in control, etc. And this is definitely my normal orientation, and does make up the biggest chunk. But after a certain point it gets flipped, and she's stroking my hair, kissing different parts of me, etc. I don't feel submissive (though maybe this is me misunderstanding the concept) so much as just cared for, wanted, prioritized.

As I said above, these aren't new experiences for me. But the frequency is a total 180 from anything I've done. Instead of happening once in a while in moments of vulnerability, it's becoming part of the regular cycle of our interactions: hookups and the aftermath, but also normal coexistence. I should probably mention that she's 6'1"", maybe an inch or so shorter than me but tall enough such that the normal variation of her footwear means she's pretty much oscillating around my height. And so far I am loving it, it allows me to pretty much shift at will into a mode where I feel short (obviously kind of rare for me) and somewhat more feminine (no offense to all my short kings out there. You dropped this: 👑). So as we're walking I can put my arm around her waist, or throw it around her shoulders and lean into her.

It's making me aware of something that's always been happening inside myself, something I had never seen clearly before. Recently I've tried open myself up to a bit of what I feel is femininity. I got a pretty floral tattoo (big ups to Gene Coffey in Queens, the og of the watercolor style), pierced my ears, sometimes will experiment with painted nails, etc. It feels natural to me and though it's subtle relative to a masculine build and style of dress I feel like it's brought me on the outside more in line with how I feel on the inside. Takes some vulnerability too, and I've noticed certain changes in the way that strangers treat me that took a lot of getting used to. 

Now, I'm not sure what exactly makes this girl act differently than anyone I've been with in the past. It definitely manifests as her being particularly attracted to me, but I think that's my own perceptions translating it. I don't think anything in a relationship happens in a vacuum: what compels you do whatever it is you do with your partners? I think there are certain unspoken signals that sort of guide our actions. And though it's impossible to say for certain, I think me opening up myself up to some internal femininity probably led to some unconscious signals that helped lead to her treating me the way she does.

I've had very little time to get used to it but what I'm noticing, and **the reason I felt compelled to make this post**, is this: *it actually makes me more comfortable being masculine*, or dominant, or in control. With the gift of hindsight, I can see that in past relationships I felt deep down like I was keeping up an act, somewhat fraudulent and fragile in being the man in our interactions. Any experience I had of having my hair stroked on someone's lap, for example, wasn't frequent or sustained enough to give me what I needed. And what that was, was the chance to recharge. By analogy: I'm pretty much an extrovert, but when I'm forced to act that out for sustained periods of time it starts to get exhausting and unfun. I see the same with masculinity: my father, for instance, is able to drop his self-expectations in some ways but keeps the globe on his shoulders for far too long in others. All this is to say that I've learned it's very important to explore the internal distinction between acting out a static vision and being attuned to your own dynamic nature.

**TL;DR** even for the most masculine people among us, keeping it up 24/7 is absolutely exhausting and infeasible. Allowing some femininity to enter into our selfhoods can actually be an interesting way to facilitate relationships and situations that allow us to recharge a bit, and this only makes masculinity more sincere, easier to practice, and more honest.",1.0,1.0,1.0,141.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ivxf5p/dating_somebody_new_is_showing_me_how_rare_it_is/,TheEnemyOfMyAnenome

2020-09-21 01:29:30,"Gender equality is a good thing, but is it a good goal?","I was thinking about the conflicts between men's advocacy communities and feminism, why it's so hard for ostensibly egalitarian groups to find common cause, and why these might occur.

I wonder if it's an over-emphasis on equality.

Don't get me wrong--I think that inequality has been and still is a major problem, but it might be a 'forest for the trees' situation--striving for equality, whether you're working on improving life for men or women--might be counter-productive in some ways.

The first reason for this is that the other group might not have it as good as you think. it can be hard to see the challenges other people face--I know from talking to male friends that they just don't see a lot of the shit women go through, and I know from talking to female friends that the opposite is also true. The opposite gender likely has a lot of issues you don't think about, and at least you have some experience dealing with *your* gender's issues; suddenly getting treated like the people who *seem* to have it so much better than you would likely be really, really difficult.

The second reason is that if you view equality as the best path toward improving your station, it makes achieving equality paradoxically undesirable, because once you're equal, there's nowhere to go.

This second one seems particularly damning, because it takes those hard-to-see challenges that your counterparts face and incentivizes actively downplaying and ignoring them. The better the other side has it, the more strenuously you can argue for an improvement of your own situation.  The more problems the other side has, the less impactful your calls for 'equality' become, even if the problems they face are different from the problems you face. This inherently polarizes groups that have absolutely no reason to be in competition with one another.

I'm not sure what the solution is. Inequality is a really good indicator that easily solvable problems eixist; if X *isn't* a problem for men, we should be able to solve it for women, right? But if it's your only heuristic for ferreting out places where society could improve, it reaches the limits of its utility pretty quickly, and even becomes counterproductive.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensLib/comments/iwi4ka/gender_equality_is_a_good_thing_but_is_it_a_good/,Tinfoil_Haberdashery

2020-09-22 00:48:05,How to cultivate people in your life who are comfortable with reversing gender roles?,"After some soul searching I'm fairly confident that I'm either non-binary or simply just not cut out for the ""male"" social role.


I'm realizing that I'm way happier assuming a more feminine role, but I'm having a really hard time with being confident in that role and having people in my life who are not only accepting of it but also comfortable enough to encourage it.



I realize part of that is on me because it's really tough to go out and portray myself as feminine (I find myself defaulting to a more masculine presentation so I don't get side eyed) but even the friends I have who seem accepting of the feminine parts of me I choose to show seem a little... anxious about it I guess?


I'm just wondering if there are some ways I can explore this side of myself with people who are truly accepting. I've hidden this side of me away for so long that I feel like I need the chance to actually explore it socially in an environment I can make some mistakes.


I guess I'm a little lost on how to do all that as someone who's both very introverted and feels a lot of pressure to simply act masculine since it's the easier thing.",1.0,1.0,1.0,5.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ix45hz/how_to_cultivate_people_in_your_life_who_are/,girlytransthrowaway

I generally lurk the sub to get an idea of what women think and I'll admit I learned a lot more than I expected. But for some reason this thread has me feeling a little easy and I'm not sure if I'm being dismissive.

For example there are a lot of posts justifying it by stating crime statistics, but isn't that white nationalists do? Also, there are people claiming that men get wrongly combative when they're accused. I'm a pretty calm person normally, but the number one thing that will make me lose my cool is being accused of something that I didn't do. It also feels like it throws away the presumption of innocence out the window.

2020-09-23 10:47:03,Nussbaum's work on dehumanisation.,"One of my favorite things about Menslib is being exposed to new (or new to me) ideas.  A very good recent example of this was a comment discussing ""dehumanization"" cut and pasted here -




&gt;""Nussbaum's work on dehumanisation in general has been enlightening for me, I'd suggest everyone at least have a cursory glance over her seven properties of objectification.

&gt;-Instrumentality - ""You are valuable only for what you can do for me""

&gt;-Denial of autonomy - ""You lack the ability to make informed decisions""

&gt;-Inertness - ""You have no power over your own actions""

&gt;-Fungibility - ""I could drop you and replace you without consequence""

&gt;-Violability - ""I am allowed to hurt and damage you. Your boundaries are meaningless""

&gt;-Ownership - ""You are my property""

&gt;-Denial of subjectivity - ""Your experiences and feelings do not matter""

&gt;I think we can identify a lot of the trauma men-as-a-group experience with these properties, especially instrumentality, fungibility, and denial of subjectivity.""

I definitely agree with the original poster with respect to the three items on the list that they've highlighted as particularly pertinent to men,  but I think I'd add violability to my own list in a roundabout way.   Insofar as (as a recent post put it), ""men's bodies are their defense"", I think it's also generally assumed that men *don't need* boundaries.   If only for the idea that any transgression against our boundaries are considered so slight that we'd be fools to complain about them at all.   Less ""I am allowed to hurt and damage you because you're less than me (or unable to stop me)"" than ""I can abuse and attack you, and you've no right to complain because...""

2020-09-24 04:26:45,"The Boys, and Masculinity","The Boys, a very popular Amazon Original, has recently debuted its second season, and has started to touch on some interesting ideas regarding masculinity, and toxic masculinity specifically.

**Spoilers abound!!!**

Set in a world where superheroes are real and are marketed and commodified as they likely would be if they were in our world, The Boys focuses on a crack squad of ragtag criminals who all have beef with superheroes, and work to dismantle the privileges and power that dominate their culture.

The two characters I want to primarily focus on here are Billy Butcher and Homelander. Both I think are two sides of the same coin of toxic masculinity, and who will likely go down different paths regarding dealing with their issues (as long as the writers have half a brain).

Billy Butcher is at once a man with a depth of emotion and love for his wife, and at another, a man with a deep, brooding rage that is destructive not only to himself but those around him. He leads The Boys, and is the most ravenous in his desire for vengeance against superheroes, most importantly for killing his wife ,as he thinks, throughout season 1. In the most notable example of his rage in Season 1, he abandons his friends in a murder-suicide rampage to try and get back at Homelander, the superhero who rapes and murders his wife. When Butcher returns in Season Two, he is still deep in these toxic ideas, still lashing out at his friends for not going on his destructive rampages (such as during his violent efforts to capture another character, Kimiko’s, brother). When he reunites with his supposedly-dead wife, she eventually rebukes him as putting her on a pedestal which had, in some respects, pushed her away from him.

And then there’s Homelander. As the leader of The Seven this Universe’s Justice League, he is analogous to Superman in this Universe, if Superman was a miserable, broken asshole. He has laser vision, he can fly, and he’s virtually indestructible. He is also an incredibly vulnerable and hurt man that can do anything he wants or make anyone bend to his will.

Anything, except make them love him. 

Homelander suffers from extensive trauma from his upbringing, essentially without parents, growing up in a lab environment and built from the ground up to be exploited by those above him. This all has, of course, gone to his head, and now sees any human as beneath him, which is ironic given them again still having power over him with the approval he so desperately craves. He uses violence and force against others without a second thought, which further drives people away from him.

Butcher and Homelander both seek approval and love from those around them. The difference that will make or break the two of their journeys, however, is the people around them at this stage in their journeys. Butcher has Hughie Campbell, a man who has demonstrated a willingness to be vulnerable and, over time, a growing willingness to call out Butcher on his bullshit. His macho man aggressiveness is not impressing anybody, and it only hurts those around him. Homelander, as it is increasingly shown, only has people either willing to exploit him, such as Edgar, the CEO of Vought, the company that markets superheroes, or Stormfront, a *Nazi* who likely only gives a shit about Homelander in the sense that he can help her get what she wants. (I *cannot wait* for her to eventually get her just desserts, because again, she is a *Nazi*)

I find the writing decent in portraying these ideas and am hopeful that they won’t fuck it up. There’s more I could go on to, such as The Deep (this universe’s Aquaman) and his struggle with his own body and how he turns the shame he has for his own body and turns it against and abuses women. (I’m not really liking the whole cult thing he’s getting involved in as a story, but if that’s part of the OG comics, well...🤷‍♂️)

Any thoughts folks? I’ve been eager to have a bit more in-depth discussion about how this show is tackling these ideas, because the show subreddit sure as hell ain’t.",1.0,1.0,1.0,37.0,/r/MensLib/comments/iyicek/the_boys_and_masculinity/,mandolin6648

I recently got out of a yearlong relationship and am back on the dating scene. One part of our relationship failing was different sex drives, as I could easily go 1/2 per day if my partner was up for it. The thing is, while I’m very confident about my performance and reception from women, I’m often anxious and insecure about how sexual I can be when meeting new people.

2020-09-24 21:18:02,"How to keep people with ""Dark Triad"" personality traits from power?","A post I made on a History-focused forum, that might be interesting to cross-post over here because of the appeal such people have for alt-right and Manosphere-leaning individuals, and because of how such people further regressive agendas for their own benefit, with results that can often be felt by men and women alike. 

&gt;By now, it's a widely accepted fact that people with ""Dark Triad"" personality traits - narcissism, Machiavellianism, and psychopathy - are more likely than other people to aim for and/or achieve power, for a wide variety of reasons. And while some people blame capitalism, I think that even in a society straight out of a Le Guin sci-fi novel there'd be a very concrete risk of a takeover by self-serving master manipulators: indeed, even the most well-intentioned IRL revolutions ended with the most cunning and ruthless on top, either as leaders or, much more frequently, as pernicious behind-the-scenes influences.

&gt;And while this post was inspired by the blatant, flagrant lack of empathy of a certain orange-hued politician, he's only the most recent example of sociopathy in action - and while he's not exactly the book version of Petyr Baelish, there surely are a lot of individuals, known and unknown to us, that are pulling his strings to their own benefit, and this has been the case since the dawn of civilization, give or take a few hundred years of recorded history.

You may have seen me post an older versions of these in conversations on this sub but I realized it was hetero-normative so I remade them to be more inclusive and to include a wider range of scenarios. This is version 2.0. and I believe these images and quotes will foster the men's issues conversation that we wish to see in the world.  


Here they are:  


* “Men ~~can’t be~~ **are** victims of abuse ~~too~~”
* “After what he/she did to me I’m ~~not a real man~~ **a survivo**r”
* “~~He probably deserved~~ **nobody** **deserves** to get slapped”
* “But it’s ~~different~~ **not okay** when she hits him”
* “We should ~~laugh at~~ **protect** men who are ~~weak~~ **vulnerable**”
* “His partner’s ~~naggingg and belittling~~ **emotional abuse** makes him feel worthless.”
* “When my family ~~insults and undermines~~ **verbally abuses** my dad it is ~~not~~ a big deal”
* “If he tells anyone ~~he was abused~~ **she is an abuser** people will think less of ~~him~~ **her**”
* “When my buddy gets smacked by his partner ~~he can handle it~~ **I stand up for him**”
* “His partner ~~controls how he spends money~~ **commits financial abuse**”

2020-09-25 23:59:36,Is it reasonable to blame life issues on genetics?,"Hey ya'll. Sorry if the title is kinda unclear, wasn't sure to how to succinctly label exactly what I'm trying to to talk about. Basically; I see a lot of folks (incel groups especially) that pin a great deal of their issues on genetics, seemingly because it's an inherently unchangeable part of us and so it gives them an excuse to not put effort in. You're just a victim of the ""genetic lottery"", nothing to be done, etc.

Just to begin with, I'm going to vent out my own personal experiences. Partially to add context, mostly just to get shit off my chest if I'm being real.

For a time in my teen years I definitely bought into a lot of that movement, including the genetics part of it. Luckily it didn't last long, and before long I could see that kind of talk for the excuses they were. I started putting more effort into myself, instead of just expecting everything I wanted to just be given to me. The thing is tho... all these years later, and a lot of the core issues that initially led me down that path are still present. If anything, they're worse than they've ever been. 

&amp;#x200B;

So for background on myself; pretty typical story I'd imagine. Only child raised by a single, low-income mother. Variety of different father figures over the years, most of them were awful for a multitude of reasons (the only halfway decent one's I've had have all been drug dealers, which kinda says something... but I digress). On top of being pretty broke, I'm also skinny af, and up until High School I was a foot shorter than pretty much everyone else. Between all that and a general lack of socialization with siblings or anything, I had a lot of trouble fitting in. I remember the first people I talked to on the first day of grade 1 immediately started making fun of me for having cheap thrift store clothes. 

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to Jr. High. Had a couple friends over the years, typically only one at a time for about a year. Eventually found a fairly consistent group with the other nerdy, out-of-place boys, and started going down that aforementioned incel-ish path. Got over that and decided to try and make the changes I wanted to see. Started putting more effort into my appearance. Got a part time job to interact with more people, and to make money to spend on nicer clothes. Spent time looking into fashion, life advice, etc. Put a lot of effort into being more socially active; talking to people more, saying yes to the (rare) invites and organizing shit on my own to invite people out too. And that did work, kind of. Wasn't any more romantically successful but I managed to form a pretty fun group consisting of all my classes general ""outsiders"". Unfortunately it wasn't long until that group fractured - beefs started forming, people started moving, and eventually I did to, going to a different city for my last year of high school (wherein I kept my head down and only really socialized with one kid who wouldn't leave me alone). 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, couple more years down the road, and I'm living in the city with my (at the time) best friend from that group of outsiders, working whatever kind of kitchen jobs I could find. Ended up in one job that was largely filled with other young folk, either in my situation or working part time during university. For the next year, that place essentially became the next ""high school"" for me, a place to be social, make friends, and form crushes on cute people. Some people were immediately pretty chill, almost immediately started inviting me to smoke a joint with them after work or whatever. Otherwise, I applied a lot of the lessons I learned during high school - namely, planning and initiating social outings. And it did kinda work, went to see and do a lot of cool things with cool people. But before long, I started to get pretty insecure about the fact that I was \*always\* the one initiating. That no one was ever inviting me out to anything, or just sending me a text to chat about shit. It felt like people enjoyed my company, but more than anything, they just appreciated having someone to invite them out to shit - not because they were really interested in me. I just had a spot that was conveniently located, and was aware of events around me. I could find a group to go out with, but I ultimately felt alone within that group, valued only for what I provided and not for who I was. So, like before, I tried to adapt. Tried to make myself more interesting. Started putting more time into hobbies outside gaming, weed-smoking and clubbing - namely music, basketball, photography, and long-boarding. 

&amp;#x200B;

That... really didn't seem to have any impact at all. The dynamics stayed more or less the same until I left the job, after which no one I worked with really cared to to talk with me. A few people liking my photography on insta and whatnot, but whenever I'd try and reach out, I'd be met with short, low-effort responses that were clearly intended to go nowhere - if I got a response at all. There was one exception to that - an older dude I started going out with a lot the the summer before I quit. We've hung a couple times since, one time was actually initiated by him, but in general he's super inconsistent and really bad about never responding to messages. 

&amp;#x200B;

Past that, shit has been really lonely. I still had a couple friends from outside work, and I tried to meet more of their friends to expand my social group a bit. On top of that, I also did a year of University. In both cases, I could see the results of the effort I put in over all these years; I'm a lot more outgoing, a lot more personable, a lot more considerate. Whether meeting new people or doing a group project in class, I was always the ice-breaker, the one getting people laughing and feeling comfortable. I actually had a wide range of hobbies and interests to talk to people about. Despite that tho, the end result still seemed largely the same - people just weren't interested in me. Outside those group projects, no one in class would talk to me unless they had a set reason to (tho tbf I was the only dude in the course). I'd see those friends hanging out with their other friends they introduced me to, without ever having invited me out along with them. With the friends I did have, it seemed more and more like they'd only initiate when it was convenient for them (eg ""yo I'm going to see my girl on the north side maybe I'll drop by for a beer"") or when they wanted something out of me. Those friends are no longer my friends at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

(\*\*personal ranting done\*\*) All that is to say; the effort I've put in and the changes I've made just haven't done much for me. Sure, I'm able to have nice friendly chats with neighbours or dudes running the shops I frequent, but ultimately I'm more alone than I've ever been. The only person who ever reaches out to me - who genuinely seems to care about me - is my mom. Beyond that, idk. People like me, but they don't really seem to care about me, to respect me or really even want to be friends with me. My life just generally feels inconsequential. And I feel like I'm running out of obvious causes I can point to and say ""this is what I need to change"". I'm long over my social anxiety, I've cultivated a strong sense of style, I've vastly broadened the areas in which I spend my time. I've grown a lot, in a lot of different ways. Still far from perfect ofc but that applies to everyone. But none of that changes the fact that I'm more lonely than I've ever been. And I'm finding myself slip into that idea that ""maybe I just don't look good enough"". I'm a skinny, baby-faced dude who still looks like he's in high school despite being 22 - is it so crazy that people would be more dismissive of me because of it? That they'd inherently show me less respect, that they'd be turned off of the idea of hitting the club with me? It sounds too convenient - like I said before, almost an excuse to just stop trying and be a victim - but I'm kind of running out of other ideas. And I don't see many guys who look like me living the kind of life I want to live. 

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, I know a big part of shit right now is just that I haven't found people I really want to be friends with in a long time. Ive tried joining some clubs and some pick-up teams, but I never feel like I belong (often due to being a poor, inner-city dwelling, Malt-Liquor-drinking pothead lol), and I'm often glad to \*not\* belong. Everywhere I turn it seems like I'm being met with racism, misogyny, transphobia... just general bigotry and conservatism. I have no idea where to even begin looking for people who I actually want to be around, people who are like-minded, who aren't turned off by poverty, and who share at least some interests. But a big part of me feels that, even if I were able to find such people, they still wouldn't be all that interested in \*me\*. I'd still have to be the one fighting for someone else's attention. And I'm sick of that. I'm sick of never having anyone put in even the slightest amount of effort towards being my friend. I'm sick of having to struggle so hard for something that seems to come so effortlessly to most other people. And at this point, idk maybe I'm to full of myself, but the only difference I see between me and those people who other's care about is the fact that they actually look like a man/woman, and I look like ""some kid"". 

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, I've probably rambled for far more than enough at this point. Ultimately, the questions I'm trying to pose; to what degree do you think our inherent, unchangeable traits impact our life? Is it reasonable for me, or anyone else, to think we're at a disadvantage over this kind of stuff? Or are we just making excuses to avoid confronting more difficult issues? I know personally speaking my journey of self-improvement is, in the grand scheme of things, just getting started. And I know it's not good to compare yourself and your life to other's. But that shit is easier said than done, and I'm left wondering why it is that some people just naturally draw in others, while I'm desperate just to get someone to give me more than a passing thought.",1.0,1.0,1.0,7.0,/r/MensLib/comments/izm40w/is_it_reasonable_to_blame_life_issues_on_genetics/,RyanB_

2020-09-26 11:35:12,High School a Microcosm of Society?,"Hello everyone, I’m a soon to be 20 year old male in my sophomore year of college. I grew up with a lot of trauma both at home and at school, and have been reflecting on it in order to hopefully heal. 

A perspective that I have come across in my reflections and through my various psychology and sociology courses in University has been extent of the effect of human nature on behavior. I hypothesize that most humans act purely based on ingrained biological behavioral tendencies and their environment. This might be a Captain Obvious statement, but applying this theory has been able to help me explain the social behavioral tendencies of others through middle school and high school that I wasn’t able to explain while in those stages of my life. I am striving to find a more robust theory to social behavior than “High schoolers are immature”. For context, I live in a wealthy and relatively diverse area of Maryland and went to high school as an awkward, skinny guy with glasses. 

In my time in high school, I saw all of the different types of people. What I noticed is that the entire spectrum of society from rich to poor, attractive to ugly, white, black, Muslim, Jewish, etc. was represented in some form or fashion in my school. It looked from the outside to be a perfect high school-aged cross section of modern society. This sounds great, but it was actually a very strange dynamic. 

The different demographic groups separated and created cliques. The black kids had their own group, the poorer white kids had their own, the rich-white-Catholic-popular kids, the Asians, the Indians, Muslims, nerds, Jews, etc. The extent of the segmentation of these groups still blows my mind, as these groups were so segmented as to be indistinguishable to the untrained eye. There was a generally unspoken rule that these different groups did not associate with each other, except for example at parties when the rich white kids would invite the black athletes over. Not to say that these kids didn’t talk to each other in a cordial fashion or as acquaintances, but they were clearly separate groups. 

The nature of status as well was something that I look back on in reflection. Popularity in my view resembled a bell curve with the ultra-popular at one end, most kids in the middle, and the nerdy/poor/ostracized at the other end. All of the idealized forms of status in society were reflected in popularity. The pretty girls were at the top with the muscular guys, the black athletes were just below, the drug suppliers were around there, and so on and so forth. As you can probably guess, I didn’t have a very good time. I hypothesize this is because of biological tendencies to favor humans with ideal reproductive and/or socially desired qualities such as height, muscularity, and dominance in males and attractive physique ratios in females such as the the hourglass figure. The socialization aspects come into play when considering skin tone, athletic pursuits, drug/alcohol usage, etc. So for those that don’t fit into these ideals, there is the “middle class” of popularity and for the very unfortunate there is the low end. 

My question is, how much in your experience has high school proven to be an accurate representation of society at large given the demographic cross-sections of your high schools? Do you still observe these behaviors of different cliques based on similar race/ethnicity, socioeconomic standing in the real world? Are unattractive or poorer people still ostracized to that degree outside? How much credence do you give to my idea of the bell curve of popularity based on genetically hardwired human biological preferences and socialization? I might be stating obvious statements, but I would love your thoughts on the matter.",1.0,1.0,1.0,23.0,/r/MensLib/comments/izygov/high_school_a_microcosm_of_society/,dantheman6783

2020-09-28 05:23:29,Is a man wrong for wanting only biological children? How should he deal with paternity fraud?,"So after going through some threads recently, a lot of men(including me honestly) show apprehension at the idea of raising a child that is not biologically theirs. Are they wrong to feel this way? Logically it shouldn't really matter. Family and blood aren't the same after all. But then why do most people try to conceive before they even think about adoption? Clearly some genetic connection is important to the vast majority of people. 

Personally, I don't think it's wrong of me to want a biological child. Given the nature vs nurture debate, I think it's just as ridiculous to ignore the nature half of the equation. If my wife told me she'd rather get a sperm donor then it'd be very natural to feel hurt. I'd feel like she just told me I'm not worthy of spreading my genes. The biology matters too because it takes two to tango and both of the parties involved in creating a child should share responsibility in supporting the child.

Where things get a lot more grey are cases of paternity fraud. The two immutable facts about paternity fraud are

 1) The mother did one of the greatest acts of betrayal there ever was and should be condemned

And

2) The child shares no blame in the situation. They didn't ask to be born after all and in fact were also mislead by the mother


The grey part is the assumed fathers reaction. Often people are quick to shit on the father for leaving the situation or abandoning the child. Personally, I do think the assumed father should still step up and be a parent. But a lot of the responses shitting on the father seem to come from a lack of empathy for what the father went through. 

Some men claim that they'll still love the child no matter what. Others will say that they'll forever see the child as the result of his wife's betrayal and couldn't bring themselves to stay. Honestly, I think it's a perfectly valid feeling to have but it's very unfair to put the negative repercussions of those feelings on the child. However if you have these feelings, how good of a father can you really be?

I'd like to think that I'd practice what I'd preach but I'm honestly not sure. The magnitude of betrayal is so high I don't even  think it's possible to be sure at all.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensLib/comments/j0z65q/is_a_man_wrong_for_wanting_only_biological/,CraptainToad

2020-09-28 07:46:47,"""You're the most emotionally closed off man in my life"". How to learn to be emotionally open?","Last night I was having a conversation with my girlfriend and she told me what I said in the title post. I was taken aback because I do not see myself as emotionally closed off, I always saw myself as emotionally open. I am a pretty open minded guy and not too serious, I tend to joke around a lot. 

I talked to her to find out what she meant. She told me I'm great at being there for her and letting her talk to me and share her feelings. She said I am very supportive and reliable. She told me she sees me be open with my friends and help them when they need it no matter what, but the issue is that I never seem to let others in. I don't talk about my life, my feelings or my past very often. Looking back, everyone I have dated has said some variation of that- they say I come off as distant, closed off or mysterious. 

I know this not a problem exclusive to men, but it seems much more common with us. How can I learn to be emotionally open? I always feel like if I tell people my emotions or my struggles I am bothering them and burdening them. Also, I grew up in an abusive home and the easiest way to minimize the abuse was to never react to anything that was thrown at me, emotionally or physically. 

I have found strength in stoicism and controlling my emotions so I don't get hurt or hurt others, possibly becoming logical and unemotional to a fault. I know a lot of other men struggle with this, what is a good way to combat it? 

Note: I know going to therapy to deal with my abusive childhood is a part of this. Right now, it is not something that is financially an option.

I’m 23 October 1st, and I feel like this was one of those relationships where I felt like I finally came together as a person and I want to make this one work.

She wants to take time to think and see if she can potentially be happy and be with me at the same time (past issues with depression, recently a huge improvement in her mood). I’m happy for her and I want her to be happy, but she wants to talk at the end of the month in October to see how things go basically.

Here are the things I’m currently thinking of learned from past relationships, and I wanted to check with you guys to see if you think it’s healthy for my mental and social health, I don’t really have others to talk to about this. So here goes.

I know I need to work on myself during this month, find my hobbies, get back to what defines me as a person, I also can’t assume things will go well so personally I’m kind of assuming it won’t go well just because I don’t want to get my hopes up and crash and burn when we meet. Finally, I need to improve on the flaws I was working on, not for the purpose of getting back with her, but for improving my own health and sanity as a person.

I'm thinking about possibly doing a case study on King of the Hill as a whole because I recently came back to the show that I grew up watching and realized how smart it actually is. This isn't the only time sexual assault is a topic on the show but it seemed so much more passive here and almost a secondary thought to what Hank was currently doing.

Keep in mind this is an episode from 2001 and I just thought it was interesting showing the main character who's seen as the everyman of the world going through this.

For information on mental health resources and support, feel free to consult our [resources wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/wiki/edit/sidebar/resources_for_men) (also located in the sidebar!)

Remember you are human, it's OK to not be OK. Try to be kind to yourself and remember that people need people. No one is a lone island and you need not struggle alone. Remember to practice self-care and alone time as well. You can't pour from an empty cup.

Take a moment to check in with a loved one, friend, or acquaintance. Ask them how they're doing, ask them about their mental health!

2020-09-30 02:53:28,"""Positive Masculinity"" is unsatisfying. Here's what we should be talking about instead.","*Masculinity* is dead.
Long live *masculinities.*

Let's talk about the state of masculinity in the modern day.
I think we all have a pretty good handle on the topic of Toxic Masculinity, a set of societal pressures on men which encourages us to inflict harm on ourselves and those around us. 
We recognise Toxic Masculinity as that voice in the back of your head that tells you not to seek out help if you are unwell, physically or mentally, and that anger is the only acceptable emotion to express publicly.

We also recognise that so-called traditional gender roles have failed us.
They have denied agency and political power to ~50% of the population, outside the domestic sphere, and left fathers distant from their families.
Traditional gender roles also deny the existence of people who do not easily fit into them.
We recognise that a family does not always comprise a cis man who works and a cis woman who raises 2.4 children in a house with a picket fence in the suburbs.
Humanity is far more diverse, far more interesting and always has been.

If we recognise that it's time to tear up the script, then our next question is inevitably ""What shall we replace it with?""
This is, I think, why the most common kind of post in this subreddit is some variant on ""What is positive masculinity?"" or ""Which male role model best embodies positive masculinity in your opinion?""

Those posts are fun.
They're easy to participate in.
However, I also find them quite unsatisfying.
There's nothing uniquely male about confidence, resilience, vulnerability, leadership, or confidence, to list  a few common responses.
For rolemodels, we like to bring up Terry Crews, Mr Rogers, Jean-Luc Picard, the Lord of the Rings cast, and whoever starred in Marvel's latest blockbuster.
They're all great guys, I'm sure, but they don't have much in common with each other.
This new Positive Masculinity we're trying to define ends up looking muddled and confused.

So where do we go from here?
We accept that there is no single, unified positive masculinity.
Instead, there are multiple, overlapping *masculinities*.
We can see a this clearly in what used to be the highest ever upvoted post in our subreddit.
I am, of course, talking about [""Queer Eye"" is Actually a Fantastic Example of Positive Masculinity](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/80eczi/queer_eye_is_actually_a_fantastic_example_of/).
The hosts are all masculine, without question, but express that masculinity distinctly from one another.

Under this new paradigm, masculinity goes from being some prescriptive, something you can fail at, to be descriptive. Multiple masculinities comprise multiple overlapping spheres, like Venn diagrams, where some of us have a lot of overlap with one another, and some of us are more adventurous in our gender expression.
Instead of trying to define a new kind of hegemonic masculinity, which will always seem like a cage to some of us, we embrace the fact that while we are all masculine, none of us are quite alike.",1.0,1.0,1.0,321.0,/r/MensLib/comments/j25na2/positive_masculinity_is_unsatisfying_heres_what/,delta_baryon

2020-09-30 23:34:49,Does anyone else feel guilty about wanting a “male space”?,"So, before I say what I mean, please let me preface:

Discrimination by sex and/or gender is terrible and I do not support it. Please understand I am not advocating for it in any way.

I’ve been thinking lately about gendered groups. I see female only clubs and groups a lot (in online spaces now and some from before the pandemic). Whenever I see someone ask about why they don’t allow men into these groups, the most common response tends to be (with exception to safety or privacy concerns for some of these groups) “sometimes it’s just good to have a place where you are just with people of your own gender”. And like, I kinda get it? Sometimes I wish there was a male-only place I could be a part of, because it would be nice to be able to talk about some things about maleness with other people who shared those experiences. This sub is really good for that, but I don’t mean a public forum, I mean like, a private group. But every time I feel this way, I feel guilty, as if I’m reacting to some sort of internalized sexism. And then I ask myself “well, they exist for women, why not for men?”, but like, that’s not a good argument. It could be that these women only groups exist because of sexism and other discrimination in communities, and by wanting something for men as well, I am distracting from the issue at hand. I worry that I am reacting either with internalized sexism or some form of jealousy over these groups, and maybe I am? Does anybody else experience this? If it is internalized sexism or a jealousy of these groups, how would I stop feeling that way?",1.0,1.0,1.0,29.0,/r/MensLib/comments/j2oe2u/does_anyone_else_feel_guilty_about_wanting_a_male/,againreally-comoeon

2020-10-01 00:44:06,"Where do we get our (non-patriarchic , non-misogynist) ideas about men's sexuality?","I asked a version of this question at r/AskFeminists, because I am interested in explicitly feminist ideas, but a few u's suggested I asked here as well. 

When I was an adolescent (boy), my mom had a copy of *Our Bodies, Ourselves*.  I read it and developed a feminist understanding of women's sexuality. But later in life, it occurred to me that I never had a comparable, feminist-informed guide to my own sexuality. Because I was raised by feminists as a feminist, I developed a feminist sense of my own sexuality, but I honestly don't know how relevant my experience is to other men. 

So I'm wondering where boys and men and feminists can go to learn about male sexuality. I understand there are a lot of resources about what male sexuality *should* look like as the end point of a process of (self-)liberation, per feminism. I'm looking for a starting point - resources that say, ""here's where you are, here's how you get to where you ought to be."" The male version of *Our Bodies, Ourselves*, if you will. 

To be clear, I am absolutely not here to defend or argue about male sexuality in any way that excuses the harm men do. I am most interested in references to books, articles, or websites - what sorts of things men on here have found useful in forming their own ideas about sexuality in their own process of liberation.

To me, the verse that begins with

&gt; And if I show you my dark side, will you still hold me, tonight?

while especially keeping in mind it's end

&gt; Would you send me packing, or would you take me home?

are especially powerful and express the intense fear some of us can have of sharing our feelings, as often times they could be met with disgust. I know for me, every time I imagined opening up to my friend, I thought about this line, even if it doesn't exactly match since she isn't my SO.

Please, if you haven't listened to it, give it a listen. Roger Waters' singing is filled with so much emotion and half of it's power is in the delivery.

2020-10-03 06:47:14,"""Girls like boys like me.""","This sounds like a strange subject to start a conversation, but bear with me a little. 

[""Like me""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL4ntL58hfk) is a song from [Teen Beach Movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teen_Beach_Movie), a 2013 Disney film that deals with two teens from 2013 that magically get transported to the setting of a 1960's musical (loosely based on West Side Story). 

Now, this particular song depicts the clash in relationship views between modern teens and their sixties' counterparts, and I think in spite of its levity there is a lot of interesting points that can be extracted from this. 

Regarding women, how the expectations change from being aloof and coy to taking the initiative (""take a chance, why not ask him on a date?"") and not focusing on pleasing men (""don't dress for him, it's better when you dress for you"")

And about men, not feeling the need to be in charge and in control at all moments (""chill out and go with the flow""), and being willing to be vulnerable (""look in her eyes, and tell her even if you're scared""). 

However, the phrase that got me thinking the most is in the refrain. ""I know what girls like, girls like boys like me.""

Dating and love are an important part of nearly everybody's life, and in a lot of things we do we seek to become our most desirable self in order to realize ourselves in that aspect. However, this is entirely informed by our preconception of what is desirable, which varies from person to person. Not to mention that what other people desire is also incredibly varied. 

Now, I may be reading too much in this song, but it would also admit a reading about pressure to conform, both to the present expectations of people around us, and to past standards and conceptions about relationships (which are still being enforced in the present by some people). 

Overall, I find it interesting this kind of message, particularly in a movie aimed at teens/preteens by a big studio. I'd like to see what you think about it.",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MensLib/comments/j44p5c/girls_like_boys_like_me/,MarsNirgal

*I wanted to bring this up because this past week I (19M) testified against my rapist (my dad) in court and it was nothing short of traumatizing. Reading this woman's story (linked above) made me feel like I wasn't alone in this experience but also was* ***very*** *frustrating to read although this issue is not new.* 

*Although the number is small, there ARE people who falsely accuse someone else of raping them and in those cases I understand why certain questions must be asked, etc. But especially when there's so much evidence to support a claim (as there was in my case as well), why must a survivor recount their experience in such excruciating detail?* 

*Some questions I was asked by the defense attorney:* 

* *""What is your sexual orientation?"" -* ***I am gay and assuming they knew that, why was it brought up at all? Would a woman be asked if she was a lesbian if she was accusing another woman of raping her?***
* *""Had you engaged in anal sex before your rape?"" -* ***this just pissed me off...and I answered truthfully but again why was that questions allowed and would a woman be asked if she had vaginal sex before her rape?***

*As the conviction process \[hopefully/eventually\] becomes less difficult for survivors, how do we ensure we are paying equal attention to how women AND men are being treated? Is there different verbiage that could be used or a separate line of questioning when certain pieces of evidence are at play? What can/should we do to insight change here? My fear is that while women may end up having a less traumatic experience, mens' experiences could get overlooked.*

2020-10-05 07:34:33,"In praise of Dr. K, the psychiatrist streamer reaching hundreds of thousands of gamers each week","It's not news to anyone in this sub that mental health of men is something that is routinely ignored and devalued in our culture. Young men are increasingly isolated, and when they look for ways to improve their lives &amp; health in ""masculine ways"", they often fall into rabbit holes of Jordan Peterson, Pick up artists, and redpilling. My theory has always been that men fall into these rabbit holes in search of the mental health support systems that they lack in their day-to-day lives and this is what is most available to them.

There aren't very many robust support systems for men that aren't normative as fuck. This was until I found the Healthygamergg channel on youtube. And I'm in shock.

Dr. Alok Kanojia is a Harvard Psychiatrist who works specifically with video game addiction, and he's been streaming on twitch for the past year or so. He does webinars, and even live Talk sessions with streamers and average people alike. He knows how to communicate with gamers in a really masculine-coded and gamer-coded way that is really effective at communicating eastern philosophy, meditation and psychiatric ideas to a mass lay-audience. 

I think it's amazing to have him destigmatizing mental health with gamers, and encourages people to work on their problems in productive ways, rather than lashing out.

Obviously his work isn't only with men, but his audience skews that way. What do you guys think of him?

Here are some great videos I recommend.

If you and your lover want to play around with that, more power to you. Maybe just be more open to the idea of men wanting to be the one wooed too?

What I want to talk about, are progressive people using arguments or comments that sound pro-women or feminist, but are based on the same patriarchal/misogynistic notions of why men should be chivalrous in the first place. They allude to how something in women's very **nature** makes her less responsible of her actions, because she's incapable of understanding the consequences of her actions. 

It really fucks me up, because this is the same premise that lies at core of the justification of why men are allowed to slap a women around, when she's acting a little ""hysterical"", why women shouldn't drive, work or get the vote. 

I've seen feminist women and men use arguments that seems to be based on this assumption and I don't know how to call people out. When I see people try, it usually just nukes and derails the whole conversation. Honestly, maybe it's just me and I'm not expressing myself very well? I do think that a lot of this can be blamed on clumsy wording, I know that I've been guilty of this very thing. But sometimes, I really do wonder. it's especially yikes when I see this from feminist men, when they start to sound like ""Monocled Victorian Landowner Gentlemen"".

2020-10-06 23:09:07,Don't (publicly) tell men/women what makes them undatable to you,"This has been on my mind some time. 

Although it's a fairly common thing to do, I think most of the time it's a bad idea to speak openly what traits, personality types and so forth which generally makes a man or woman repulsive to you.

First of all, it's very rarely of general importance to even talk about such things. People like different things. Someone's ""Lazy unkept loser"" is someone else's ""chill person"" so it's debatable what's even accomplished by that. They find their own people and you should find yours, but nobody is actually obligated to fashion themselves to appeal to a select group of men or women.

More importantly, I get the feeling that such talk has high triggering potential, that men and women who read such things, happen to fit the description of what this one person find so horrendously off putting,  it can often be a real gut punch, amping their self consciousness up to eleven. 

Another good reason is how such talk has a tendency to drive and perpetuate norms around things which really should be relative and not confine people. We already know that some of the biggest problems with gender roles stem from people's innate wishes to be desired.

Lastly, I'm disturbed by the trend when people want to make a political point which operate on ""Do/be this or you are completely undesirable"". The intent can be ok depending on which, but the tool used is immoral. Only time I'm borderline ok with it is in case we're talking about criminal, abusive and exploitative behavior, but even then... do you really have to dangle a 'peepee' or 'vayjay' on top of the argument? Truly necessary to drive your point home? I doubt it.

Talking like that used to be considered vulgar. (Reinstate that particular norm thanks!)    

Now... obviously people have a right to their actual likes and dislikes. Everyone can name a rough version of the desired sex(es) whom they wouldn't want to touch with a pole.

However, I have an Instagram account and I can’t help but notice that my “search” page looks extremely different to my wife’s.  I basically use Instagram for landscape photography shots and I only follow other photographers.  Despite this, Instagram fills my entire feed with sex workers/only fans pages whenever I click search.

I’m no prude, and I’ve looked at plenty of porn over the last 30 years but it just really bothers me that Instagram think they can advertise sexual services to me like this without my consent.  If I chose to follow accounts like this, that’d be one thing, but I’m literally seeing women, bound and gagged popping up in my feed with seemingly no way to stop it.  Not only that, but in amongst them, are girls who are clearly 14 years old etc.

2020-10-08 06:24:35,"I was a really shitty man with a woman I really liked, and we're not speaking anymore.","I just fulfilled that stereotype of a shitty male partner/friend *so* much. She said I made her feel unattractive.

And I did! She said I was checking out another waitress while I was on a date with her. I didn't have sex with her one night when she was in the mood, when I should have anticipated it. And when she asked me what my ideal body type was, I described a body type that was the opposite of hers. That was the straw that broke the camel's back. 

I really was attracted to her though, and none of these registered as shitty actions to me until she pointed them out. And they are! I was being really shitty!

When she told me, I did my best to apologize for causing harm, acknowledging that what I did was wrong. I said I should have been more thoughtful and, even though I was legitimately attracted to her, that doesn't matter if I don't show it well or worse, indicate otherwise. 

So I guess two things:

1) I have ADHD, and I suspect I have Aspergers. I struggle with social situations, particularly missing social cues. But I want to love and be loved. And I want to stop hurting the people I love. What can I do to be more aware? 

2) For now I just have to sit with the loss and the weight of the harm I caused. But I still feel awful and I want support. This woman was basically my only immediate human connection now (which is also my fault).

AMA!","I’m a German psychologist, psychotherapist and author currently based in Berlin. My first book “The Highly Sensitive Man” was published in Germany in 2017 and has since been translated into Dutch, Swedish and English. The US paperback was published in April 2020. About seven years ago, I developed a particular interest in the concept of high sensitivity as a temperamental trait and the research behind it. But I felt that all the books about sensitivity that were out there were written for and by women – as if high sensitivity didn’t exist in men (it does!). I therefore decided to write the first psychological guide for highly sensitive men to focus on masculinity, sensitivity, self-care and practical strategies and tools to improve emotional regulation.

2020-10-11 01:41:55,The deeper reasons behind expectations placed behind Male and female bodystandards,"So i was thinking about penis sizes. and i was reading a reddit post where someone said that he had a friend who's dick was so big that some girls wouldn't want him to penetrate them. and there were some guys in the comments talking about how they would totally be ok with having that.
  
  
and this made me think about how different standards are for men or women. the expectations placed on men and women seem to come about for very different reasons. Women are expected to please Men, but Men are expected to just be ""manly"".  
  
having a big dick is ""manly"" so its desirable even if it makes sex worse for women.   
  
is there any reason why its like this? or why those traits are seen as manly in the first place?",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,/r/MensLib/comments/j8oq96/the_deeper_reasons_behind_expectations_placed/,officiallyaninja

Right now it seems that philosophies like PUA, Redpill and the like are better at marketing themselves than more left leaning concepts. 

Personally it seems to stem from the fact that these philosophies sell themselves to somewhat insecure men as ""solving a problem"" (namely not getting female attention) and seem to proport to be doing this in a ""tell it like it is/ this is the *real* secret"" manner that mixes in a good chunk of less than savoury ideals.

So it got me wondering, is there an equivalent for menslib? Can there be? After all, a large chunk of what we talk about here are societal problems and how to overcome them. Which isnt really a practical concept for the more self help/individualistic literature that tends to be marketed.

I find myself comparing myself to other people who have girlfriends and such and I feel bad because of what I supposedly am missing out on, as well as worrying people judge me for not having one, like what do they think of this quiet guy?

As a side question, is it generally about trying to be more confident, or just being comfortable in your own skin? Is it just more to do with how I am, like happy or not? How do I know when someone isn't quite right for me?

Now we know full well how the male gaze is marketed/catered to A LOT and we can find way more examples of ads, tv, comics and games using half naked women to make a product more desirable 

However where I see male nudity is in this almost invisible section where it's almost as if society doesn't care. 

A man in a pair of boxer shorts is seen as the default in a lot of series as in your typical TV show treats it as another outfit where a women does not get that level of invisibility

You can see it the most in really weird comedic tropes in cartoons (aimed at kids) that has the main character stripped to their underwear (mainly white briefs) which never really happens to female characters. (Think of often you see Honey and Bart undressed vs Marge or Lisa) Like in socie we know it's very bad taste to look at kids this way yet even in modern cartoons this trope gets used.

2020-10-13 11:22:15,I am disappointed in this sub,"I have been a big fan of this sub for some time, but lately I have felt like it’s not really a sub for men in some ways.

I was honestly shocked in one thread recently regarding a male father and the discrimination he faced when the daughters friends weren’t allowed to stay over. I couldn’t believe some of the people posting (both men and women) saying how it must have been the guys fault and that it’s totally fine to not let your daughter have a sleepover because there is a single father in the house. The worst part is these posts didn’t get massively downvoted. 

In fact, Instead of focusing on men’s issues it veered into some saying how there personal experiences with bad men justifies there discrimination.

If course with this logic I could say “I was robbed by a Black person, I have every right to now be racist”. 

Why were these posts upvoted or tolerated? 

And lastly, that thread showed a more subtle insidiousness that I have seen on this board that people here should know better about: the CONSTANT assumption that even if it is unfair to the father, he needs to fix the situation. Very little talk about the fault of discrimination is on the discriminators and most importantly, showing actual compassion and validation for this man. 

I see a lot when women vent on feminists boards (including this one) and people are quick to be sympathetic toward, but when men bring up there issues people often skip the emotional caring part and go straight to matter a fact solutions (which is wild considering what this sub is supposed to be about).",1.0,1.0,1.0,4.0,/r/MensLib/comments/ja5lt4/i_am_disappointed_in_this_sub/,anotherday31

3. Other people do those things, even though I don't. 
4. Still, lacking them doesn't bother me.
5. Lacking life partnership won't bother me either. 

Here's another:
1. I can't predict the future, not even my own.
2. I can't predict that I'll be alone forever.

And one more:
1. Human lives are finite, no one can do everything.
2. I have enough to do that's worthwhile without dating. 

Goodbye for now. I really hope that this post improves someone's life.",1.0,1.0,1.0,11.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jaex5d/arguments_against_inceldom/,Left_Ad6857

2020-10-17 06:23:16,"Post-industrialization, working class men and the alt-right","I recently heard a point that I've been circling around for a while stated really well (from the Swedish language podcast Komintern if anyone is [curios](https://poddtoppen.se/podcast/1485460595/komintern/s04e02-hogre-veckopeng-billigare-godis)). Hopefully this isn't too rambly or off-topic, I'm posting it in this sub because I legitimately think it's important for progressive male advocates.

Basically, a couple of decades ago, working class men in large scale worked in various industries while working class women to a large extent worked with children, elderly or as nurses.

Today, many industrial jobs have been automated or moved overseas while more female coded jobs don't face this threat.

Since men typically are expected to be providers this means that the unemployed men who would previously worked in the industry it makes their lack of a roll in society even more pronounced.

During the 2016 US election Trump talked about bringing home overseas industrial jobs. While he hasn't been terribly effective at this, and indeed would probably mean that these jobs would be extremely poorly paid to be globally competitive, it was still a concretely important question for a large number of people.

The rhetoric of the alt-right is also something that is very appealing to a large number of disfranchised men, because it's about reclaiming mens traditional role in society in a very ""masculine way"".

Incel culture also fits in well with this. Women typically are more interested in someone who has a stable life as compared to men who typically are more interested in youth and beauty. Women who aren't successful by male standards have comparatively good relationship prospects.

As people who are opposed to the alt-right and similar movements we ought to find an alternative way to address these issues.

While they aren't typically part of the alt-right, this hits migrant men even harder who usually have an even weaker position on the job market. For example, many Muslim migrants joined IS a couple of years ago for what I'm guessing in similar reasons.

The problem will likely only get worse. Right now, many men work in the transport sector. Many of these jobs might disappear as well with self-driving cars.

One possible way to address this is to weaken gender roles to allow men to more easily work in currently female-coded jobs. This will make things better for men, but only by spreading the unemployment out over women too. It's not as good of a solution as one that creates more jobs. Getting rid of the patriarchy is a hard process so it's not something that can be done particularly quickly either.

Another way to address this (and many other things) is to end capitalism. This is also a bit hard to pull of.

A milder version of this is to restructure the way society works in a slightly less radical way to address the shrinking need for labor. For example, we can consider the 6 hour work day or a sufficiently generous UBI plan.

A further way of addressing this that I'm quite exited about is the green new deal. Often environmental politics is put in opposition to industrial jobs, but the truth is that in order to reach our climate goals a lot of work is required, and much of this work looks a lot like traditional industrial labor. Building green industrial plants and high-speed trains and what not is going to provide a lot of jobs for people who would perhaps have worked in a steel factory 50 years ago.

2020-10-21 14:05:04,What is your story behind you not showing emotions / not crying?,"What I mean by this question is: What caused you to generally avoid showing emotions / crying in front of others? It could be an event in your childhood (or multiple), or similar stories to that. I think if we shared those stories it could shed a lot of light on why exactly men generally don't like to show emotions as much, instead of just blaming it on ""toxic masculinity"". It may not be wrong to blame it on TM, but the term is pretty broad.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's mine:

The reason I generally dislike (and still kind of do) showing emotions / crying in front of other people is that, as a kid (kindergarten / elementary school), I cried. **A lot**. During sports lessons when we were playing games like football, baseball, dodgeball etc. whenever I lost, I would start crying. Or at least get angry up to the verge of crying and make up excuses as to why we lost (our team only consisted of kids that were bad at sports, the other team had all the sporty kids in it, the other team cheated, etc.). In short, I was a very sore loser as a kid. 

Obviously, that didn't make me very popular at kindergarten or school, so whenever I'd get made fun of by my other classmates and I'd get even slightly upset, they'd start teasing me with ""oh, you gonna cry? You gonna cry now, huh? HUH? Cry, baby, do it!"", their goal was essentially to make me cry.   
I was also known among the teachers as the sensitive kid. (Though they didn't make fun of me for it. I think. I don't quite remember.)

In kindergarten it was probably worse than in elementary school, because the combination of me crying easily and having a terrible haircut (my hair reached down to my shoulders on very bad occasions) made me an easy target. Yeah, I was also teased as being a girl.

Those bad experiences as a kid caused me to bottle up my emotions when I grew older. I'd say it probably helped me avoid a lot of flak for crying, because after middle school, the bullying against me pretty much stopped. (It probably also had to do with the fact that my classmates grew up too.)

I think the last time my friends ever saw me crying after elementary school was that one time I was ugly crying while drunk. And it wasn't a very pleasant experience either. They at least didn't make fun of me at the moment, they were trying to comfort me in their strange way (less of ""it's okay man"" and more of ""come on, man! Stop crying! Let's go back to the club and get a drink!"", which is better than nothing, I guess.), but they still tease me to this day for that evening.

Nowadays, I still only really express my emotions in private (especially crying), because it makes me really uncomfortable to cry around other people, except if we're at like, a funeral. I did notice that I'm more comfortable crying around my family, mainly because they didn't tease me relentlessly for doing so like some of my former classmates did.

I often feel like I have no appropriate place to discuss men's issues without being labeled an MRA incel or partaking in anti-women circle jerks in such groups. I think those other movements have some valid points, but their extreme views and anger turn me off. I definitely can't find solace in feminist groups without being mercilessly denigrated for having the audacity of questioning any aspect of their dogma, pointing out double standards, or just talking about mens issues. I'm always questioning things, which has led me to being banned and dog piled on at times. I just want to find the most objective, fair, just, and reasonable truths as possible.

2020-10-22 22:29:47,Positive outlets for male sexuality?,"So, recently, musician Lily Allen released a sex toy, and it got me thinking.

Obviously, male sexuality isn't stigmatized in the way female sexuality is. In most spaces, men can talk about all the woman they've had sex with (usually in more misogynistic terms), and if a women talks about sex she's shunned.

However, at least for me, I don't live in the circles where those discussions happen - and I'm happy about that. *But*, there isn't an alternative. In progressive circles, positive open discussion of sexuality isn't a thing. Hell, I'm pretty sure if a male musician released a fleshlight he'd get mocked to the ends of the earth. This isn't a complaint about what Lily Allen did, I think normalizing sex and masturbation is totally fine, I just wish that there was room for that for men in progressive circles.

Personally, at times I almost feel ashamed of my sexuality. I say this as a Bi man, and by ashamed I don't mean towards my attraction to men, but ashamed of being sexual. I feel like I can't bring it up even jokingly without straying too close to the classic example of sexist dudes bragging about getting laid. There just isn't a framework for healthy, open, joking discussions about male sexuality, whereas for women it's normalized - again, only in these specific circles. 

How can we change that? How can men talk about their sexuality in ways which are healthy, joyful, and non-toxic? How do you deal with the stigma that you feel?",1.0,1.0,1.0,404.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jg0o7u/positive_outlets_for_male_sexuality/,lordberric

2020-10-23 15:48:11,Love is an irresistible desire to be irresistibly desired.,"In the recent discussion on the presumption of consent by males, a poster had made this comment -

&gt;I think that is what appeals in ""older men"" fantasies. It comes from wanting to feel incredibly desired and sexy like they can't believe their luck and would do anything to have you. In the fantasy the older man feels incredibly lucky to have scored himself someone young and beautiful and puts you on a pedestal. If you've ever had a fantasy about hooking up with someone really nerdy the concept is similar.

The commenter goes on to distinguish between the fantasy of being absolutely desirable and the actuality of being obsessed with you. 

The comment reminded me of the old Robert Frost quote in the thread title,  oft seen on posters hung in college dorm rooms.   In trying to google the source of the quote, I came across this article...

https://philosiblog.com/2013/01/01/love-is-the-irresistible-desire-to-be-irresistibly-desired/

&gt;Well, irresistible is defined as “Impossible to resist.” or “Having an overpowering appeal” and desire is defined as “A wish or longing.”, “The object of longing” and “Passion or appetite.”
That about covers it, doesn’t it? “Love is the overpowering appeal and longing to be impossible to resist by the object of your longing.” And, when stated that way, it seems a little clearer, or at least it does to me.
When you look at it, isn’t that what love, the raw emotion, boils down to? You and the other person, both succumbing to the appeal and longing of being impossible to resist to the other person?

I'm not sure exactly what it is about this quote and the article,  but something about it sets my teeth on edge.   Maybe it strikes me as an absurdly immature and narcissistic view of love (love is how much you desire me), or maybe it comes off as just a little too obsessed with power and controlling (this love is so strong you can't resist it),  neither of which are qualities I associate with healthy, mature and caring relationships.  Maybe I'm just reading too much into it.

Maybe I'm simply thinking of James Baldwin's -

&gt;""There seems to be a vast amount of confusion in the Western world concerning these matters, but love and sexual activity are not synonymous: Only by becoming inhuman can the human being pretend that they are. The mare is not obliged to love the stallion, nor is the bull required to love the cow. They are doing what comes naturally.""

2020-10-24 05:26:40,How internalized transphobia kept me from realizing I was attracted to boys,"Around the same time I figured out I wasn't a cis girl, I also figured out that I like girls and nonbinary people. That was about four or five years ago. It took me until this year to realize I actually like boys as well. The idea of being in a relationship with a guy used to make me deeply uncomfortable, so I always assumed that meant I just wasn't into dudes. It was only very recently that I did some self-reflection and found out the actual reason why.

The only boys that ever showed interest in me were straight boys that didn't understand my identity, so I couldn't really picture a queer guy being attracted to me. Every time I had pictured being with a guy, I was actually picturing being with a \*straight\* guy specifically. I felt like if I dated a guy, that would somehow make me a cis girl. Because of my insecurity about ""acting too feminine"", I felt that if I was in a relationship with another guy, I would end up being the ""woman"" in the relationship. 

The uncomfortable feeling that I got when I pictured being with a guy was actually dysphoria. And as I've gotten better at accepting myself as a guy, that feeling has started to go away.

&gt;This might sound ironic, considering what I just wrote, but this is why I've begun to feel like us progressives should reclaim the whole ""seduction"" thing from the manosphere/red pill. We should strive to become more comfortable linking these discussions with something practical.  
This is an issue that I've seen about this topic specifically. I feel like we don't realize how dismissive and disrespectful we may sound when we talk about male sexual needs; by questioning why men feel the way they do or what importance sex should play in their lives and what made them feel this way in the first place. We often create spaces where men could get the unconscious sense that they have to chose between opening up about their sexuality or having a sex life at all. The truth is that we should try to offer both, otherwise why the fuck would they want to come to us at all? 

A bit confrontational, but my main point still stands: a lot of men feel like they need help, and we should be able to take this need seriously, without alienating the person behind it.

2020-10-24 14:57:45,"""They aren't built the same way.""","Sometimes, even in the most liberal corners of the universe, the ""old ways"" still creep out. Modes of thinking that are regressive and ridiculous, even when associated with some infinitesimally tiny truth beneath the lies. In this case, I can't say just how liberal the offending person was, I can only say that this is within a group that's most definitely not fighting for anti-feminist values. 

I (a guy) was in a political volunteer meeting last night. For about two hours, a group of 25 men and 75% women worked together to talk through all sorts of technological, organizational, and other issues. We're human, we had disagreements, but it was civil, logical, reasonable...hey, I thought, this is a great team! The backbone of it are women over 50, and you can 100% believe they do a backbreaking amount of work. Without them, this whole operation would be a useless mess (mostly because not enough guys are showing up to help!). They're involved in all parts of the operation, top to bottom (including my own mother), so there's no question that they're integral to the work.

We finish, and I stick around in order to talk to the group's director (also a man) about a new role I'm fulfilling, and one other, older guy (same age as the average women) also stays in. I figured he also needed to clarify a few things, so I didn't think too much of it, until he said the following, partially paraphrased: ""I've been a volunteer coordinator for years, worked with a lot groups, and I know we have a lot of women here. I think we know they aren't built the same way, and that's why I keep pushing for us to be more concerted about recruitment."" 

""They aren't built the same way."" In context, I'm assuming he means they aren't aggressive enough? Lord knows, but I just sat in silence and let the director try to deflect away from that statement and talk about general trends on volunteering (agnostic to sex/gender). In the back of my head though, I was just trying to tick through possible reasons why someone would say something like that. Sure, these ladies were born and raised in an era where being more reserved about things is normal, but the folks in this call sure as shit didn't qualify for the moniker ""reserved."" Maybe ""polite,"" but they've been chasing down volunteers just as readily as I have (more so even). 

The truth is this guy is sexist and thought he was in a safe enough space to reveal that bullshit. Weird that, given I was literally wearing feminist campaign merch on a camera for two straight hours, but I suppose old habits die hard. The only reason I didn't call him out then and there on this was 1) I'm relatively new to the group and 2) it doesn't have the best control over its own IT (so dropping him from the group safely for everyone is not a simple matter). 

Solutions? Fortunately, this is slightly easier than many other situations (which is a privilege I wish everyone had). My mom has been working with this group for quite a bit longer, and has enough of a rapport (and power) that I don't need to worry about whistle blowing (initially to her/to discuss things appropriately, then to make a more formal complaint) and worrying that it will come back to haunt me. Even if it does, hey, I'm a volunteer and I have no issues going to the next group and putting my hours in there. 

No matter what though, it validated my opinion that there is a generational problem that we need to work on. Not just teaching older men to treat women correctly (in public or private), but to believe it in their souls.

# INTRODUCTION: What is Masculinity?

&gt;**By Jake Stika, NGM Executive Director**  
&gt;  
&gt;Masculinity is a performance. Masculinity is relational. Masculinities are plural.  
&gt;  
&gt;My masculinity is different than yours, which, in turn, is likely different than that of the next man you see.   
&gt;  
&gt;Being a man doesn’t inherently make me masculine, either. A trans friend taught me this, sharing the story of how he had to relearn how to look at his fingernails, or how high to place his hands on his hip. Try it yourself: when you look at your fingernails, do you do it with your fingers stretch out, or with them curled in?  
&gt;  
&gt;Whether I’m on a basketball court, in a boardroom, at the pub, or in the bedroom, my masculinity will be different in each context. Athlete, professional, buddy, or lover—each time, the identity I don is a bit different. It’s a performance, and it changes based not only on the setting, but also the other players taking part in the scene.  
&gt;  
&gt;My masculinity is influenced by my race, ethnicity, citizenship, class, education, sexuality, relationship status, ability, and even height. I was never great at math, but I do know that the potential outcomes for these permutations and combinations are damn near infinite. This is masculinity as the **personal**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Masculinity is hard to pin down. Binary thinking such as right/wrong, yes/no, black/white, leads one to suppose that masculinity is the opposite of femininity—but what then is femininity?   
&gt;  
&gt;If we entertain this binary, we are practising gender essentialism—the attribution of fixed, intrinsic, innate qualities to women and men. This is harmful not only to trans and nonbinary folks (because it completely erases them) but it’s also harmful to men and women. It imposes measuring sticks for us to fail against.   
&gt;  
&gt;If traits such as nurturance, supportiveness, and affection are the essence of femininity, how can I ever be the doting father I hope to be? If traits such as leadership and assertiveness are the essence of masculinity, how can a woman ever thrive in roles of authority?  
&gt;  
&gt;This idea of sex = gender is a stumbling block. Equating our genitalia with how we should exist in the world—well beyond our roles in procreation—has caused nothing but heartaches and headaches to people of all genders and sexes.   
&gt;  
&gt;This is masculinity as the **political**.  
&gt;  
&gt;Together these ideas of masculinity as the personal and the political make up a system we know as patriarchy. Patriarchy’s etymology is from the word *pater* (father) and *arkhein* (to rule). Here are some theories for the origins of this system, borrowed from Noah Yuval Harari’s *Sapiens*:  
&gt;  
&gt;**Muscle Power**: Simply, men have the physical strength to overpower women into submission. A slightly less overt version being that men had the strength to hunt or plough the fields giving them control of food production, therefore clout.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Violence**: Women can match men as far as hatred, greed and abuse are concerned, but when push comes to shove, the theory goes, men are more willing to engage in raw physical violence.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Genetics**: As men competed against each other for the opportunity to impregnate fertile women, an individual’s chances of reproduction depended above all on his ability to outperform and defeat other men. A woman, on the other hand, had no problem finding a man willing to impregnate her. However, if she wanted her children to provide her with grandchildren, she needed to carry them in her womb for nine arduous months, and then nurture them for years.  
&gt;  
&gt;Each of these is problematic in their own right and easy to poke holes in but after the past 70+ years of discussion about women’s roles and identities in society under the banner of feminism, it’s very clear that none of these serve any of us, whatsoever. Further, the advances made in decoupling work from manual labour, diminishing violence globally, as well as family planning, have all helped create tremendous opportunities for people.   
&gt;  
&gt;Women have taken full advantage of shedding the yoke of narrow conceptions of femininity, and have advanced in many traditionally male-dominated arenas. But, for some reason, we men stubbornly cling to man-boxes we can barely stretch out in. In this way, gender stifles us, frustrates us, sets us up for failure, and leads to men causing harm (to more folks than just ourselves) under the banner of ‘masculinity’—whether subtly, like through the pride that keeps us asking for help or the drive we have to dominate, or more explicitly, such as through substance abuse, violence, or self-harm.  
&gt;  
&gt;We’ve come to do a great job of telling our daughters that they can do anything that boys can do. We can’t say we do the same for our boys. Until we go just as far to tell our sons that they can do anything that girls can do, then we’ll forever be stunted in our boxes. Until our society expects men to thrive as parents as we expect of mothers, then fathers will always continue to feel secondary.  
&gt;  
&gt;In other words, we need to put an end to the notion of men ‘babysitting’ their own children. We need to normalize men holding roles in early childhood education or caregiving, or we will just keep stunting men’s ability to express their emotions, and pathologizing those who do.  
&gt;  
&gt;It’s time to drop the measuring sticks. It’s time to set ourselves up for success, so that all individuals can express themselves authentically, and so that the ways in which we understand our own gender, sex, and identity don’t keep feeding the systems of patriarchy that hold us all back.  
&gt;  
&gt;Let’s drop the performance, relate to one another with integrity, and embrace the multitudes within each of us. That’s my hope for the future of masculinity. Or, should I say, the future of masculinities.  
&gt;  
&gt;My hope for the future of masculinity is that we drop the measuring sticks associated with masculinity and femininity and embrace the authentic expression of all individuals while collectively tackling the system of patriarchy so that we can drop the performance, relate to one another with integrity, and embrace the multitudes within each of us.

2020-10-25 04:33:47,NC State vs UNC football game,"Idk if this kind of post is allowed, or from me, so take down if needed. Did anyone else watch this game on espn? I found the commentators to be refreshingly open and positive about men connecting with one another. They talked about one coach having social justice conversations with his players, to learn from his players. How 2 coaches got past not knowing what to say to each other. How another coach came back to coaching to be there for players. And towards the end, one commenator asked another if he or his son was better at their job; the guy's response went through some things senior and junior were each better at but that he would sit the fence on who was better. After a followup question, he replied (as I best remember) something along the lines of that's what he does for people he loves. I wonder whether I actually heard that, but I hope I heard right.

Maybe it's more common than I think and I'm just not paying attention, but it seemed unusual to me. Do you think so? Maybe those interactions fit neatly into what is ""allowed"" to coaches and players and isn't remarkable and is actually commonly highlighted.

2020-10-27 00:54:39,Pay For Your Porn,"I've seen some discussion elsewhere about people's resistance to paying for porn, and as someone who has been a sex worker I wanted to share a plea: if you want your porn consumption to be ethical, you NEED to pay for it. Yes, there is no fully ethical consumption under capitalism and we're all doing the best we can with what we consume, but it is particularly important with porn to ensure that what you're consuming is ethical. 

I'm going to break this up into sections. First:

**Why you need to pay for your porn**

I could write pages of reasons for this. But above anything else: don't you want to make sure you're not watching someone being raped or abused? I would assume any decent person would. When you're consuming porn from free porn aggregator sites, there is no way real way for you to know if there is any meaningful consent for the performers you're watching. If we are interested in liberation for all, that includes sex workers

There's also no way to know if the performers you're watching are being fairly paid for their work, or if they have consented to their work being found on those sites. When I modeled for SuicideGirls and similar sites, I agreed to have my photos or videos up *on those sites* and was paid for that. I was not paid for the photos and videos that were pulled by users and posted elsewhere and I received no profit share from that. I did not consent to my photos and videos appearing on other sites. 

Other people in the porn industry express similar concerns with free porn sites:

&gt;""The free tube sites are a very controversial business model that has been profiting from other people’s work, image, bodies, creativity, and talent for the last decade,"" she said. Her own films have been stolen and uploaded onto tubes, often with sexist or racist titles with her name nowhere to be seen.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;""Clearly tube sites are not a vehicle of promotion for me,"" said Lust. ""Most importantly, neither I nor my guest directors or performers have given consent for having our material there. Whether they know the content they have in their platforms is stolen, we cannot be sure, but it’s happening all the time."" - Erika Lust

Purchasing your porn also helps encourage a market for porn created in safe, ethical environments where meaningful consent is possible. 

**Where can you pay for your porn?**

There are TONS of sites where you can buy feminist porn, and that doesn't just mean sites where you pay to pay an expensive monthly fee. I don't want to make this post seem too much like some kind of marketing post so I'll post some links in the comments. 

**A personal note**

Look, I understand that most of us aren't swimming in money right now. I understand that there's a TON of free porn available. I understand that most people are in the habit of just consuming that free porn and not thinking twice about it. But as someone who has been a sex worker and experienced both joyful, empowering sex work and not truly consensual, degrading sex work, the latter took a decade of therapy to heal. I cannot help but look askance at anyone who claims to care about sexual liberation but does not include sex workers in that, or expects sex workers to continue to work for free and in dangerous or exploitative conditions.

This place had opened recently and is a short walk from my home so I decided to try it out. Nothing wrong with the place, other than it's a bit too expensive for my liking. But what really made me uncomfortable there was how sexualized the whole place was. All the servers and stylists were women, with push-up bras and really short skirts. The wall decorations were all filled with quotes that were barely disguised sexual innuendos, and the same with the products themselves. Means a haircut plus shampoo is haircut plus shampoo, not *get pampered by our ladies in house*.

I don't know what to say, I am really open-minded about things, and am probably a bleeding heart liberal, but this made me uncomfortable. I have worked with women bosses a lot, and they have been great mentors for my career, and my wife jokes I am more ambitious about her career than she herself is - but this place seemed to reduce both it's female employees and it's male customers.

2020-10-28 04:57:01,"Jane Elliot's ""Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes"" resonates with how we look at manhood.","If you don't know who Jane Elliot is, she is a school teacher turned diversity educator and is famous for her ""Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes"" exercise. The exercise is pretty simple, you can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott), but I wanted to talk about a particular [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi3iqJykwEo) and how it resonated with my experience as a man.

In the beginning of the video, Jane Elliot starts out with:

&gt;Perception is everything. White people look vicious, and ugly, and non-caring, and cruel, and arrogant, and powerful, and condescending...and angry.

She then turns to a white woman in the crowd and asks her if she's angry. She says no, she then turns to the white lady sitting next to her with the same question. This lady answers ""trying not to"". Elliot then asks her if it takes a lot of energy, she says yes. Elliot asks ""are you holding it in?"", the lady replies yes. Elliot then asks ""if she's trying really really hard not to react to her"", the lady replies yes, again. Elliot continues to ask questions like ""Does \[trying not to look/react to Elliot\] take a lot of energy?"", ""Is \[trying not to look/react to Elliot\] hard for you?"", etc.

The lady continued to reply yes. 

This line of questioning goes on for a while and culminates with the question, ""if you had to do this every day what would happen to your blood pressure."" and without hesitation, the lady replies that it would rise. 

I'm a black man and I've seen this clip many times in the context of racial discrimination, but every time I watch it, I think less of my blackness and more about my masculinity. The very adjectives that Elliot uses are words that I've heard to describe the ""danger men pose"" particularly to women and children. I'm often described that way, expectedly and unexpectedly, by friends, family, and strangers. In general, it's something that I wear on my back along with the added stress of being black. 

And I don't think I'm the only one. The stereotype of men as predators, unempathetic and powerful, hurts men who are victims of domestic violence when it comes to getting assistance from shelters ([they are often assumed to be perpetrators](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/)) and when it comes to getting temporary restraining orders, [male petitioners succeed less often, even if you control for the level of violence](https://www.verbalabusejournals.com/pdf/research/court-custody/restraining%20orders.pdf). [Men are often given longer sentences](https://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx), [even after controlling for family responsibilities, offender characteristics](https://lawcat.berkeley.edu/record/1120434), and other legally relevant variables. 

When it comes to gender equality, we're often [ignored](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-men/201705/gender-and-mental-health-do-men-matter-too) because we are often assumed to be the standard. Suicide rates are often blamed on unproven claims of ""masculinity which may encourage suppression of emotions or resort to anger."" Claims like these assert to have a rigid definition of masculinity, one that connects being a man to suppression of emotion and anger, and one that certain discriminates against the multi-faceted nature of the billions of unique masculinities. 

The point I'm trying to make is that the adjectives that Jane Elliot used to get white people to empathize with the experiences of racism are similar adjectives to what I, and I suspect, many other men are called every day, overtly or covertly.",1.0,1.0,1.0,68.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jj9r1t/jane_elliots_blue_eyesbrown_eyes_resonates_with/,theromanshcheezit

2020-10-30 23:10:15,When you do everything right but it feels like not enough.,"I know these are signs of depression. I am not misguided in this.

However, I am in a situation where I have been Verbally Abused, Physically Abused, Mistreated and otherwise inside my workspace.

&amp;#x200B;

Some of it was deal-able due to circumstances. Now it's gotten to an apex that I just do not know how to handle. Hell, even my puppers has caught onto my mood and how disheartening it is.

&amp;#x200B;

I have worked with a construction company as their IT guy. I have had some members underneath me for related things. Things are going well inside the IT department. We have a strict budget and do what we can. I am the manager currently. Or was...

Over the past 2ish years, I have been asked for nudes of my SO, I have been physically hit and roughed up by coworkers (not in my department). I have been verbally abused. I drove 18 hours to be in office for necessity for the employee who acted like such a child to ignore me and then ""go on vacation"" day 2. Before he left in a wonderful display of an older gentleman throwing a temper tantrum he had said ""YOU HAVE TO RESPECT ME, I can call you worst things you motherf\*\*\*\*\*, yeah worst names..."" I had blanked out the rest.

Because of circumstances, I have been part time for 8 months. I wanted to return to full time. We had just enough work to allow for it and I had talked with the owner about such. He said he does not see it being a problem and let's talk more in depth later.

The Owner proceeds to ignore me while I was in town. And then when I returned I was ignored all the way up until I got an email from the owner. I have a new boss and I am to ""maintain course and report to him"". Okay. Well, we do not have enough work for him but okay.

This has hit me harder than anything. I have been applying for positions for a few months now when the VP told me that there is no reasonable answer for me to come on full time and it would be best that I find a different position. Some of the work picked up recently and I figured it would not be so bad. Then I get the news of this.

It has been the worst situation I have ever been in. I am applying and being super proactive. Hell, I'm sure I'm annoying the crap out of people and then with the pandemic, it's even worse.

I finally talk with my supposed boss yesterday and the dude has no concept of IT Security and really is just 6 years behind current tech. It's terrifying. He will be and will continually be a security liability. Even moreso, they are trying to ""make an MSP"". I would never touch that service, ever.

&amp;#x200B;

On top of this I keep having BS dreams of leaving my SO who I am so in love with and I wake up TERRIFIED. I wake up like it's reality and then I reach over and she is there, thank God..., but then I just have this terrible feeling after waking. It terrifies me to leave her and these dreams just torment the shit out of me. I have not had actual nightmares in a very long time and this is the closest thing I could think to a nightmare.

&amp;#x200B;

She has been so helpful through all of this and is trying to do everything she can to assist with my mental health but it's just becoming crushing. I have (thankfully that they are fleeting and not fully serious and upfront) fleeting ideas of ending it all. Or just straight up quitting but that puts us in a horrible position and I cannot do that to the both of us. I just do not know how much more of this stuff with work I can actually handle and I can't leave the situation until something pops up. Which has been a multi-month process. I am even currently in an interview cycle that has still been 6 weeks since my interview because they want to ""find a comparable prospect""...

&amp;#x200B;

THEY LIKED ME! And yet! They still cannot pull the trigger. They've interview 6 others at this point and have not found someone of my caliber which is more infuriating!

&amp;#x200B;

2020-10-31 02:01:58,Call them what they are: the Hunter Biden leaks are revenge porn.,"Recently you might have heard talk about videos or photos being passed around the internet featuring Hunter Biden, the son of 
US Presidential candidate Joe Biden. These photos and videos show someone who is claimed to be Hunter Biden engaging in sexual
activity. Due to the timing of these leaks, it's clear they were intended to damage the reputation of Hunter Biden and his father's
campaign. Unfortunately, I haven't seen too many people call these leaks what they actually are: Revenge Porn. From FindLaw.com, a common
definition of revenge porn is this:

&gt; Intentional distribution of non-consensual porn, or ""revenge porn,"" is a type of online harassment that occurs when an ex-partner or even a hacker posts sexually explicit images of a person online without their permission.

&gt; But what exactly is revenge porn? Does it mean that someone wants revenge on another person and posts pornographic material containing them? Not quite. In fact, in many jurisdictions a perpetrator doesn't even need to be exacting revenge on anyone. The distributor of the material need only intend to distribute the sexually explicit video or photograph with the intent to annoy or harass the victim without their consent.

For revenge porn laws by state, please visit: [State Revenge Porn Laws](https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/revenge-porn-laws-by-state.html)

We need to treat these leaks like any other revenge porn leaks: Don't share them, don't look at them, don't sexualize them, and call people out who do these things. 
Hunter Biden did not consent to these images being shared online, and like all victims of revenge porn, we should note and respect his non-consent.",1.0,1.0,1.0,440.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jl1t6u/call_them_what_they_are_the_hunter_biden_leaks/,anhedonious_rex

2020-10-31 05:18:17,Quotes From Male Victims of Domestic Assault,"To preface this post, I'm trying to provide more awareness for male victims of domestic violence and how they are treated, in general, when they seek help.

It's a bit of a touchy subject and not often talked about and I think the only way to spur change is to be open to the experiences and conversations of men who have endured this.

I'm also spreading awareness on my Instagram (male\_liberation).

 All the quotes come from this [article.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3175099/#!po=7.35294)

**Experience with DV help resources**

 *“They didn’t really listen to what I said. They* ***assumed that all abusers are men and said that I must accept that I was the abuser****. They ridiculed me for not leaving my wife,* ***ignoring the issues about what I would need to do to protect my 6 children*** *and care for them.” (Experience with a DV agency)* 

 *“\[T\]hey offered to listen if I wanted to recount what had happened \[sic\], but indicated that* ***no support services were available.****” (Experience with DV hotline)* 

 *“I was mostly just doing research after the occurrence \[sic\] to find out what I should do. I found mostly* ***female help sites and was turned down by several so I gave up****.” (Experience using online resources)* 

&amp;#x200B;

**Experiences with Police**

 *“They determined she was the aggressor but said* ***since I was a man it was silly to arrest her****.”* 

 *“Told me to get her help.* ***Told me to spend the night in a hotel.****”* 

 *“****They saw me \[sic\] as a large male and…took her side****. I was at the* ***hospital with bruising and burned eyes from hot coffee thrown in them****. They didn’t believe that she did this…and* ***refused to arrest her****… The next incident…the police…****saw me bleeding they charged her with felony DV but later dropped it to misdemeanor assault because we are not married and do not live together.****”* 

&amp;#x200B;

**General Statistics on the Experience of Male Victim who seek Help (from the Results section)**

***""****A large proportion of those who sought help from DV agencies (49.9%), DV hotlines (63.9%), or online resources (42.9%) were told,* ***“We only help women.”***

*""further, 95.3% of those men (n=81) said that they were given the impression that the* ***agency was biased against men****.""* 

*""Over 25% of those using an online resource reported that they were given a phone number for help which* ***turned out to be the number for a batterer’s program.****""*

*""The results from the open-ended questions showed that 16.4% of the men who contacted a hotline reported that the* ***staff made fun them****, as did 15.2% of the men who contacted local DV agencies.""*

*""In 54.9% of cases, the* ***partner was determined to be the primary aggressor****. Among those 62 men, 41.5% said the police asked the helpseeker if he wanted his partner arrested; 21% reported the police* ***refused to arrest the partner****, and 38.7% indicated the* ***police said there was nothing they could do and left****.""*

&amp;#x200B;

**Limitations of this Study (You can read more in the actual study)**

I think it would be disingenuous if I just posted this here without discussing some limitations. This was an exploratory study because it is truly the first of its kind because it dives into an analysis of the experiences of male victims of domestic violence.  Many of the victims were found online and in spaces where men talk about domestic violence. From the Study:

&gt; The sample was recruited from multiple sources, including the Domestic Abuse Helpline for Men and Women (DAHMW), a national helpline specializing in men who sustain IPV; through ads on online websites, newsletters, blogs, and listservs that specialize in IPV, male IPV victims, fathers’ and divorced men’s issues, men’s health, men’s rights; and through a description of the study on the Wikipedia page about domestic violence. Potential participants were told and advertisements stated: “Researchers at Clark University are conducting a new study on men who experience physical aggression from their female girlfriends, wives, or partners. If you are a man between the ages of 18–59, have experienced physical aggression from your partner within the past 12 months, and have sought help for this problem, you may be eligible to participate in this study. We invite you to follow this link to complete an Internet survey.” 

They also had to meet the eligibility criteria that are specified in the report.

Despite this, there is the possibility that some respondents' reports are not completely genuine though the authors note that it would be irresponsible to claim that even a majority of the reports are falsehoods.

As I said, this study is the first of its kind. There isn't much attention/funding put towards studying male victims of intimate partner violence at all, even though it's pretty clear that men and women experience IPV.  Furthermore, men are discouraged by the experiences of other men, a loss of ""masculinity"", feelings of shame, and the stigma that only women can be victims. 

**Compared to the experiences of Women**

Even though I'd like to talk about this within a non-comparative framework, I've always noticed that discussions about men's issues tend to be mixed with conversations about how these experiences compare with women's experiences. 

It is clear that women have starkly different experiences with social services for IPV. You can read more in the Discussion section

&gt;These findings are in stark contrast to ratings of social services by battered women. For example, in a study of 119 women who sought services for DV-related concerns from a DV shelter, 89% of the clients believed that they were helped by the services that they received and 84% reported that they felt better because of these services 

([Source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1049731507307790?casa_token=hKvt2ogkLXkAAAAA:Q9Yz8vMDNb2OyCuyiN7w8hbVB2F69pva4Q6j68xdj-DHsYBQS6Fi8Vq5nUWXI-dHMkZLdfl2MHyMbcE))

And despite the prevailing narrative against police and handling IPV, women tend to be more satisfied with police assistance.

&gt;Similar results with regard to satisfaction among battered women have been found in relation to police assistance. For example, one study of 95 female IPV victims indicated that the female victims found the police to be very helpful and 80% would contact the police again for assistance.

([Source](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801203255554?casa_token=wUzAVe3qIXQAAAAA:kZpKAgGPi7FGuq_M6oU50FDwttugfWq5vh-c9lDMSE0dgmemxeLR-5BpU3SbjKNWPcthz2h_4Bx7TSM))

**Conclusion**

Intimate Partner Violence is a huge issue for men, and much of the prevailing narrative surrounding male victims re-traumatizes them instead of helping.

I missed much of the speech but there was a part of the speech I did catch which really caught my attention. Obama began discussing Trump’s performative masculinity. Someone will probably be able to clip this out at some point, and I can’t quote it, but he noted how Trump brags and has bravado but lacks what Obama said men “used to be.” Caring, hard working, supportive of their families and communities, who look out for others. The centrality of care in his definition of masculinity was striking. I don’t think I’ve heard this from him before or from anyone of such prominence before honestly.

2020-11-01 03:23:22,We can't have Positive Masculinity without Affirming Masculinity.,"I've noticed that I've really hyper focused on questions about male sexuality for some time now. After this, I'll try to maybe tone it down a bit and try to think about other things, because it clearly have affected my ability to really look at certain issues in a broader scope. My last thread, about creating Menslib dating advice, got locked for a good reason. It where too broad and had been brought up a LOT of times on this Sub. After giving it some thought, my goal of that thread where to point out certain aspects of the discussion around positive masculinity that could be applied to things outside of dating and sex. 

I'll try to explain myself in as neutral of language possible. Basically, one aspect of positive masculinity, is to stop shaming and pressuring men to try to live up to societal toxic expectations. We want men to express and celebrate their own masculinity, without shame, I have NO problem with this and it's great. What I do have a problem with is that we don't question what boundaries these toxic expectations set up around what type of men can occupy and how well certain needs can be met. 

Basically, society have implied that there's repercussions for being ""unmanly"". While we rightly point out that calling men ""unmanly"", in a derogatory way, is toxic and harmful, we don't challenge the idea of the repercussions, being seen as such might bring. Sometimes, it feels like we just try to find a way for us to change our attitudes **about** them, instead of tackling them head on. I think that this can be a very big hurdle for people to actually want to join us. 

What I would want to see more of, is Affirming Masculinity. I don't know if affirming is the right word, but my thesaurus tells me that it is. What I would love to see is us being comfortable saying that you can find a way to love yourself for who you are, no matter the flavor of masculinity and not feel like that flavor sorts you into a specific ""caste"" of male. 

Ehh, I hope you guys understand what I mean whit all of this. This is something that has been on my mind for a while and I feel like my main point came through.

2020-11-01 05:25:40,Head check: a woman's right to choice and responsibility.,"If this isn't appropriate then I'm ok with the post being deleted but I was hoping to get head check from this community.

I am in a situation where a woman chosing to have a baby is turning my life upside down. I don't want to get into too many details for privacy sake but I will say this. A young woman is chosing to keep an un planned pregnancy with an older man. The two had agreed to abort if they got pregnant and the older man did not wish to be in a committed relationship. The woman has decided to keep the child and in order for the man to be able to step up and take responsibility 5 different people are having their lives turned upside down including needing to find new apartments, move cities, lose thousands of dollars, and ended friendships.

Now before I ask my question I want to get some things out of the way.

1. Woman's body, woman's choice. I can be upset all I want with her choice but I am literally one of those people who believe that until the baby is out the mother can do what she wants.

2. I'm not upset at all about men's responsibilities towards children and the uneven way that choice and responsibility are shared. Having women have 100% of the choice and 50% of the responsibility is the way that leads to the most benefits for children and families. 

Ok so I want to discuss how invisible some of my friends are making me feel. Today someone made me feel like a woman's right to chose also meant that the effects of her choice on people around her were not her responsibility.

Like... If a woman decides to have a baby and it changes or harms my life then that doesn't matter, the only thing that matters is that she got to chose.

Does telling a woman ""hey you having a baby right now is going to fuck up my life"" oppressive? Is even having to consider how other people will be affected by the choice some kind of oppression?

The woman got extremely upset with me when I even tried to bring up to her that her decision was harming other people's lives and some of my friends have told me it's fucked up that I would ask a woman to have an abortion that doesn't want to.

One time someone even told me that I was being really problematic by being upset with this woman for using the agency I ""supposedly"" believe in.

So I want to check in with some good people and just... Maybe hear something new or learn something new.

2020-11-01 15:57:00,Struggling with intrusive anti-woman/incel-ish thoughts post breakups,"Forgive me if this is better suited to r/relationshipadvice but I found that sub a nightmare of bad advice, insecurities, and gendered biases. I'll try and keep this conversation more about cishet men's experience in general (though gender/sexuality diverse thoughts are totally welcome), but I may also talk about this for a Tuesday or Friday thread.

Had a long distance relationship end this week, partly due to contrasting status of the coronavirus restrictions and state of the epidemic where we each live, and partly due to us unable to see each other for several months due to border shutdowns. I was very saddened by the loss of the relationship as it felt quite devoted and we had made plans to move in together once borders had been opened. I think however it was the situation improving that may have created anxieties in her about the move (caused some for me also), and I guess her feelings towards me changed. We spoke for a long time but were unable to find any other recourse but to end things.

On some level, we had a fairly mature conversation about our feelings and concerns in the relationship, but the desire to break-up was not mutual. Therefore I felt myself developing judgements of her - considering her selfish, immature, like she was giving up, etc. - which quickly fed my anxieties about my own self-worth. Could it really be just the lockdown that caused it, or was there something wrong with me? Am I somehow inadequate?

These feelings can sometimes cause me to draw comparisons and similarities between past relationships and make generalisations in my head about the behavior of women. This is not helped by the non-Anglo European family environment I have grown up in which is highly suspicious of women's agency in relationships, and their capacity to be 'manipulative' of men. Of course, the contemporary slant on this cultural discrimination against women has an extremely vitriolic side in the 'incel' (which I think is a self-contradictory term) movement. Whilst I was never a true 'incel' (largely because I was never *that* racist or sexist), I do feel prone to thinking adjacent hateful generalisations about women. These thoughts can be intrusive, and mixed with depression, can be disabling. I do attend therapy and have some outlets for this, but I do also have an isolated professional life and few social circles.

My question to the sub is: Have people here been previous adherents to that kind of broad women-hating ideology and departed from that thinking?  Do they re-emerge in difficult personal moments? How do you manage to cope with these thought patterns? I see it akin to a now-atheist former Christian having fears of Hell late at night.

P.S. I want to make it clear that politically I am totally in favour of the emancipation and liberation of women, and the liberation of men from toxic gender norms and, frankly, gender altogether. 

P.S.S. I'm no doubt also aware that I'm in a raw stage of post-relationship grieving and likely some of this is near-universal. I just would like the conversation to see how we can combat these unhealthy and destructive ideologies. I also have friends whom at once brag about sexual conquests, and in 'dry spells', fall victim to summary judgements about women's sexuality and behaviour in relationships.",1.0,1.0,1.0,209.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jlyrdg/struggling_with_intrusive_antiwomanincelish/,AssociatedLlama

2020-11-02 16:53:10,"What, for you, is a healthy relationship with porn, masturbation, and/or kink?","Over the last year, my sex drive has increased significantly, probably mostly due to coming off an SSRI and starting testosterone (I'm a trans man). I recently deleted the app I was using to look at porn as I was no longer comfortable the increasing time I was spending on it, as well as the content itself getting more extreme. I've also always been interested in kink and have explored it with my (female) partner since before my transition, but it felt very different now that I identify as male because before there wasn't any actual societal power differential between us in the way that there is between men and women. I feel like I'm having difficulty navigating these things as a guy - I know biological changes are likely going to keep my sex drive higher than I've been used to in the past, but I'm not sure exactly where the line is when my increased masturbation and porn usage is unhealthy, or how to navigate sexuality with my partner in a new social role. 

So, some questions for people with more experience with male sexuality than me: 

1) What do you define as a healthy or ideal relationship with masturbation and/or porn? 

2) Do you feel that, if you are not monitoring your relationship with masturbation and/or porn, it becomes unhealthy? Does this happen in connection with other issues in your life (mental health, motivation, etc.) or is it mostly independent of them?

3) For others interested in kink, how do you navigate ensuring that you're not perpetuating gendered social roles? (This one is probably most applicable to people who are attracted to women and lean more dominant, but I'm open to hearing everyone's experiences on kink + gender)

4) Is there anything else you would like to share on any of these topics?",1.0,1.0,1.0,53.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jmk4en/what_for_you_is_a_healthy_relationship_with_porn/,The_Truth_Was_a_Cave

When I vent to my liberal friends, they tell me to stop worrying because I'll be fine whatever happens.  And when I vent to my leftist friends, they tell me that they're scared too, but we can fight it.  But what if I don't have the spoons to fight alongside them?  What if I'm just scared frozen, not scared with a call to action on social media or in the streets with a sign?  Will they drop me just as fast?

I don't know what I'm looking for here, but I'm sure I'm not alone.  I know that I'm also privileged in many ways and that's also something that keeps me from sharing.  Because who am I to talk about my fear when I have a job and a safe living situation and a support system (even if they're all too scared to be support atm)?

At the advice of many internet sources, I'm trying to disconnect, but I'm not sure how.  Everything from my TV screensaver to my work email is telling me to vote.  And I'd love a big queer cuddle pile or even just a hug from somebody I'm not emotionally supporting, but, y'know.  Plague.

**End of vent: actual question**

So.  How are you taking care of yourself?  Do you feel scared about politics and do you feel like you can express it?  And how do you disconnect when the whole US is trying their best to get you to connect?

I think this is a noble cause, but I dislike that a legitimate men’s movement that has always been treated as more of a joke than an awareness event, is being further obscured from the public by a competing event of the same name.

2020-11-04 01:53:35,Why is the Internet so often discussing sexual violence?,"Sexual violence, in its various forms like harassment, assault and pedophilia, is a very frequent topic on the Internet that mobilizes strong emotions and opinions. Does anyone have any idea why? 

I feel it has become even more important recently. On the far-right side, QAnon's conspiracy theories are essentially about fighting pedophilia. On the left side of the political spectrum, feminism informs us that sexual violence is the ugliest face of patriarchy, so talking about it this often would be a way to fight it.

However, perhaps unexpectedly, this puts a lot of focus on sex. Sexual urges and desires are too often scrutinized in a way that, in my opinion, borders paranoia. I guess _neurotic_ would be the adequate word to describe society's overall relationship with sex nowadays.

And honestly, I don't understand why any of this is happening. Particularly, I don't understand how we've come to this after the huge sexual revolution from the 1960s. I guess the AIDS crisis has a lot to do with our current attitude towards sex, but it seems feminism has developed an even sharper criticism of sex since then. Can you recommend any kind of resources that touch on this issue?

Finally, speaking like an obviously self-diagnosed neurotic, I feel society is focusing too much on what can go wrong in human sexuality, and failing to recognize all the good it can do to us — from the simple relief of masturbation to the complex, multi-layered feeling of accomplishment we get when we can fully express our sexual identity. This is quite unhealthy. I believe we should rethink this attitude if it's unjustified, hence the title question.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jnf3ko/why_is_the_internet_so_often_discussing_sexual/,ropeserif

I've noticed that my favourite male anchor just changes his tie and that's the only notable thing about his dress. I have such admiration for the female anchor dresses differently every single day and outs herself out there by dress.

I'm kinda mad that the male doesn't try at all and the audience seems to accept the status quo. Does he not try by choice or are men not really allowed to show flair on air?

I'm aware women have pressure to put in effort on dress. You have to not only be naturally attractive on air, but you've got to dress up too! I hate the double standard. So what's happened is my appreciating my favourite female anchor's flair so much! I look forward to seeing her dress every weekday and legit appreciate her 'privilege' to show flair and love the risks she takes. I've just noticed the male is just there and so blandly dressed I've stopped even looking.

They're both really smart people so both entertain me with their words, oral arguments, hosting and real talk. I'm glad they're both there. What's frustrating is how I'm still stuck on her flair as a delight. 

PS: I'm bisexual with a stronger preference for women so I'm so confused that I give the male a pass for just showing up. It really messes up my bi-cycle. I'm also really mad that women can't just show up so I'm perpetuating the pressure on them to  try really hard.",1.0,1.0,1.0,9.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jnql28/whats_happening_to_me_im_confused_by_my/,SpareTesticle

I literally only found out about it like 3 years ago, and only this year found out about prostate orgasms, which is weird because it seems like there's a lot of hidden potential there, it's like half a male's sexuality. It seems like it's not discussed much (probably because some people toxically think it's gay)


I'd heard of prostate cancer and exams and things, but never in any kind of even basic detail. Which is terrible considering it serves a reproductive purpose!

Sex education for boys and girls really needs to be better.

I recently saw someone who said something similar in a comment section, and it got me thinking - how do I perceive trans men and women? Do I have unconscious bias that causes me to subconsciously differentiate trans men from cis men, or trans women from cis women? I came to the realization that on some level, yes, I did.
So then, what is causing me to view trans men and women as such? Well, framing is what constitutes the manifestation of our perspective, so let’s examine how this is framed in my mind. First, we must understand that framing is relative to our experiences and knowledge base. I now see that I have not done the research and thinking necessary to develop a complex, well rounded understanding of the relationship (and differentiation) between biological sex at birth and gender identity. My perspective, lacking in understanding and fluidity, has therefore been more rudimentary than I would like to admit, but that I must admit in order to develop my understanding and subsequently my perspective - to grow as a person, and grow my compassion, empathy, and understanding of those around me.
Everyone has bias, and that is okay. That is human. Measure of intelligence and character is in one’s ability and willingness to shift opinion and perspective in the face of, and according to new information that we are presented. Growth and change cannot be divorced.”

In finishing thoughts, I would like to encourage everyone to listen - really listen to our trans brothers and sisters, absorb and reflect on their experience and insight. There is a myriad of life lessons which we can draw from these experiences which lend applicable to our worldly understanding in every walk of life.",1.0,46.0,0.96,103.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jpxast/examining_bias_in_how_we_view_trans_men_and_women/,dumbodowner

2020-11-08 14:10:51,Beyond binary identities (politics) through class-based policies,"I've been thinking about this for some time now to reconcile how financially and otherwise privileged people are benefitting due to policies intended to help a marginalised group.

Various forms of affirmative action and quotas are in placed to help oppressed groups such as ethnic minorities, women, LGBTQ+, non-binary etc. and likely more groups in the future as our awareness increases.

However, oppression and disadvantages don't appear to be equally spread in a group. Some individuals are better off due to other forms of privilege that we don't acknowledge, such as:

* IQ/intelligence.
* Attractiveness.
* Absense of disabilities, hereditary illnesses etc.
* A stable upbringing in a healthy family as opposed to a history of trauma/abuse.
* Born into a powerful network/community, e.g. a metropolitan city vs a rural town with poor facilities, safe neighbourhood, industrial/innovation hub.
* And I could go on, I don't think we will be able to recognised every privilege vs disadvantage an individual experiences.

As a straight man but an ethnic minority myself I have many similar friends that are succeeding at higher-education and life in general. It would seem unethical if some of us benefit from identity-based policies whilst other don't, because we marginalise their class as they are part of a privileged group (straight men).

I believe we should attempt to help all people regardless of their age, race/ethnicity, gender and other qualifiers. What do you think of class-based policies that would be fairer towards all people by taking into consideration:

* Means-testing: Don't reinforce benefits if someone already has vast wealth/assets and has escaped certain forms of marginalisation.
* Support people with trauma/abuse, mental health issues and hereditary illnesses that affect performance, such as autism, down syndrome etc.
* Opportunities available for upward mobility: educated parents, wealthy relatives that support each other (?).

I found this article online that is also thinking along these lines. I believe the current polarisation and cultural grid-lock could be eased through this approach: [https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/04/affirmative-action-should-be-based-on-class-not-race](https://www.economist.com/open-future/2018/09/04/affirmative-action-should-be-based-on-class-not-race)

We have yet to legally fully acknowledge gender fluid people - many existing policies discriminate against them because they have to fit into a gender-binary. I believe this will require a radical rethinking of our policies.

2020-11-09 20:54:48,"""Society expects men to have sex / be successful in dating"" is itself, the toxic idea","The title is messy and can't sum up my point, so here goes:

In my sexual development, I encountered 2 contradicting messages: 1) My body and psyche informed me I wanted the company of women\* 2) 'Society' expects me to have lots of sex, therefore I don't really want sex and am brainwashed.

That caused a lot of confusion. I didn't know if my desire for physical affection and general relations with women were my own, or whether I was just 'brainwashed'. I'm also raised in a Jewish society, where the emphasis is on mathematical and analytical skills. Men are raised to be calculators, and early in life all that mattered was whether I was 'smart' (= did math and science) or not.

I realized this message - that my desire for sex came from 'society' - is just a way to SUPPRESS my emotional needs, wants and general being. I was encouraged to push aside my emotional development, since ""Society just tells you sex is important, it isn't!"" and focus on studying (and eventually, leading to a suicide attempt). I could not explore my sexuality or its importance to me because I kept hearing it was just 'Society' telling me I need it.

This idea is toxic and we need to cut it off. Men are social animals like women. Many of us need touch, affection, relations with others. We must stop telling men that their emotional needs are fake with 'Society!!!' and just believe them and empathize.

I also think this would lead to a much healthier way of talking about sexual frustration, and re-taking the convo away from RedPillers and other misognists.

&amp;#x200B;

\*This is also why I had difficulties in accepting mainstream, toxic ideas about sexuality, like ""If she says no she's playing hard to get!"", ""Ignore her to make her desire you!"", ""Never ask her, just kiss her!"", ""If she has sex with you early she's a worthless slut"" and others",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jqx3dy/society_expects_men_to_have_sex_be_successful_in/,Planetof12

2020-11-11 05:27:28,"Why do we partake in ""No Nut November"" instead of something like ""No Smut September""? [NSFW discussion]","So, firstly I'd just like to state that I understand and recognize that sex work is a legitimate job, and that ""No Smut September"" is sort of a shit move to your industry.

Secondly, I'll admit that I don't really know a whole lot about NNN other than guys have fun trying not to have an orgasm for an entire month.  I'm not really sure if there's any actual proven scientific benefit to not having an orgasm, but I do believe that there is a difference between having an orgasm to porn VS having one with your partner.

I get NNN is just some lighthearted fun, but I think it also detracts from legitimate relationships and bonding with our partners.  Something like ""No Smut September"" would be a similar kind of challenge challenge, but the focus would be on you trying to avoid porn for the entire month and focus on healthy relationships and sex with your partner (or partners if you're in an open kind of relationship).

Porn addiction is a serious thing, and with porn being so easily accessible these days I think it's probably way more of an issue than people realize.  While NNN also addresses this issue, I think it also hurts us on the sense that it seems like it equally looks down on healthy sex with your partner.

NSS could be the same kind of lighthearted challenge to try to cut back on porn consumption, but it would also try to focus more on keeping (and building) your relationship with your partner.  Essentially, it changes from ""don't orgasm"" to ""don't fap""  I guess we could also make it Fap-Free-February 😂

Maybe this is a similar conversation to the one where, in patriarchal society, men always want sex.   But the implicit idea here seems to be that men *only* want sex,  and that sex is all that needs to be presented to keep a guy ""running back for more. ""

I sincerely have hit hardship with sticking with either group, for a lot of reasons. Both approaches seems kind of ineffective.

MRAs to start seem to have a lot of things going for them - like them finding a lot of issues men actually can face, crossreddit posting research regarding men, but they always seem stuck in rhetoric and never do anything that substantial. They don't address issues.

Men's lib to me has been well.... Bad. The self reflective behavior can be there, but activism here kind of makes me angry and worried at the same time because a good half if not more of the posts are just ""toxic masculinity bad"" or just in worse cases ""masculinity bad"". Like there is the lack of ""bite"" and people keep dancing around discussing systemic issues. Yes toxic masculinity exists. I am a gay man and its bad, but can we move on?

I wanna talk about the negative attitude towards men's bodies, their sexuality. The general treatment of men as sometimes disposable or lacking in human value unless earned.

In short men have topics that are much much deeper than what mens lib is willing to go, and while mras are willing to go there they dont take it in a right direction.

I am going to admit, I am not a feminist. I find a lot of their core tenets to be lacking, circular in logic and sometimes not genuine

To men's libs - There is a lot men can talk about, and its topic that can go as deep as things like women's issues. And got damn it its okay to hold feminists and women accountable. We dont have to hate them, but every time we ignore things that are wrong you give a lot of less pleasant groups ammo

2020-11-16 05:52:30,"An overview of gender stereotypes in pop culture, based on data from TVtropes","You probably heard of TVtropes, a large wiki that intends to list every single ""trope"" in entertainment media.   Each trope has its own page listing hundreds of examples, so it should be possible to estimate the frequency of each trope just by counting the examples. Using the [Gender Dynamic Index](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GenderDynamicsIndex), a portal of all tropes related to gender, I calculated the frequency of various gender stereotypes in pop culture, including films, comics, manga, books, video games etc.

The goal is to get a quantitative sense of how common these stereotypes are, to know which ones are very frequent and which ones are just anecdotal. I also extracted the release date of the examples, to see how gender stereotypes in the media evolved with time.

I figured you might find it interesting, so let's dive into the data!

Here are the top 50 most common tropes on women:

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank\_women-1344x1536.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank_women-1344x1536.png)

And on men:

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank\_men-1344x1536.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank_men-1344x1536.png)

TVtropes also has a category for tropes that contrast men and women:

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank\_contrast-1536x768.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Rank_contrast-1536x768.png)

Here is a breakdown by medium for some common tropes, revealing substantial variation:

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/By-medium-1536x1536.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/By-medium-1536x1536.png)

If you would like to see the same plot for any given trope that I did not include, don't hesitate to ask (it's very easy for me to generate new plots).

I also plotted the frequency of various tropes by date. Here are a few selected examples:

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Evolution-1536x768.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Evolution-1536x768.png)

Again, I can easily make new plots for other tropes if you are wondering about something in particular.

Here is a larger plot, showing how each trope has changed in frequency between the pre-2000 and the post-2000 eras.

[https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Change-since-2000-1536x1536.png](https://www.telescopic-turnip.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Change-since-2000-1536x1536.png)

Lots of things are just what you would expect. Here are a some observations that struck me:

\* ""Drowning my sorrows"" is the second trope about men with most examples on TVtropes. It's about male characters getting drunk when they are sad. I did not expect this to be that high (the only trope that is more frequent is ""Rated M for Manly"", that is, manly characters). And it does not seem to decrease over time. Maybe that's an issue that deserves some attention.

\* ""Damsel in Distress"" had a big peak in the 1990s, but it is getting less common. I suppose this is due to video games, which no longer rely on the damsel-in-distress scenario as much as they used to.

\* ""Men are the Expandable Gender"": this one has become more and more frequent since the mid-80s. There does not seem to be a lot of effort from writers to avoid this trope. Maybe that will change in the future?

\* In the last plot, you can see some cultural change over the last decades: ""Evil Cripple"", ""Cigarette of Anxiety"", ""Good Girls Avoid Abortion"" all became less common since 2000.

\* There are a few ""corrective tropes"", that are inversions of classic stereotypes, for example female characters taking active roles. Most of them increased in frequency after 2000, as you'd expect. However, some ""empowering"" tropes (""Damsel out of Distress"", ""Rebellious Princess"") have become \*less\* common since 2000. On the other hand, not-so-positive tropes like ""Female Gaze"" are becoming much more common.

2020-11-16 06:07:51,"""Men just can't help themselves""","I was just hanging out with my room mates, both of whom are female. For the record I am a trans man. We were discussing our hardships in dating men, and one thing we had in common was having experienced at some point being overly sexualized. When I brought up how I have never experienced these things when dating women, both of them straight out said that ""men can't help themselves, while women can"". They argued that there are biological differences that makes it very hard for men to control their urges, and that this is why some men treat them badly. One of them said that since she was young her grandmother would tell her that men only think with their dicks, and that that's just how they are. 

Now, I am not cis, so I can't speak for cis men. But I have an above average testosterone level according to my doctor, and my sex drive is off the charts. Still, I have never, once, had the urge to do something that would cause someone else to feel bad. So unless there is some secret dick curse I haven't heard about that makes people with dicks unable to control themselves, I'm going to go ahead and call bullshit on that statement.

I argued that just because someone has a high desire for sex, it does not impair their ability to not be an asshole, and that the behavior they're describing is a choice on the other person's end. And that their excusing of such behavior is what's enabling it. If women think it's okay for men to treat them badly, then there will always be some men who continue to do so. Not to say it's women's fault when men treat them badly, because it's not. But falsly beliving men can't help themselves is all but helpful for making progress.

It was also great for me because I was never particularly aggressive and, when those emotions did hit, I didn't know how to process them. I still can't really process aggression well. Autism is fun.

Writing helped me overcome so much and helped me understand so much about myself and those around me. It's amazing how fulfilling it can make you feel.

I’m about halfway through it and it already is pretty eye-opening. She cites numerous books on child rearing that I will likely pick up. I’m wondering if there’s any other good resources you folks can recommend for parenting; books, movies, articles, podcasts, whatever!

I always felt like I had a good childhood and a good relationship with my father, but once I became an adult and especially once I entered a long term relationship I realized I was sorely lacking in all kinds of ways. I was emotionally stunted, thought I was “easygoing” but really was a doormat, and I had an incredibly self-centred outlook on life. I don’t think I’ve ever told my dad I loved him, nor him me. We get along fine, but I would hardly say we are good friends. We share almost no interests apart from very superficial ones. So I’m working on myself a lot and making some progress (long way to go yet!), I feel like I have already learned some of the necessary tools to properly nurture a well-rounded boy, but more info is always helpful!

2020-11-18 01:03:39,"I've recently committed to restoring my foreskin, and I'm upset at the conversation surrounding circumcision","I will try to keep this conversation less focused on me, but the long and short of it is I finally started the journey to restoring my foreskin, and I'm just finding it a stressful position to be at in my life. 


Apart from it being a deeply personal journey to go on that obviously can't be shared with really anyone in my personal circle, I'm reminded of the times I've discussed circumcision with others and it's just... frustrating, seemingly no matter who I've spoken to about it.


Other men (or at least, redditors) seem to largely be apathetic to the conversation. The most common response is how they are so *happy* to be circumcised. And I don't want to be against that - from what I can gather, circumcision affects men differently and poses little issue for many men. If they enjoy that aspect of their genitalia, then I'm willing to accept that. But it doesn't affect all men the same, and I feel like it's affected me negatively - and it's exhausting trying to convince someone that people should simply be given the choice on what they want to do with their own body. 



My previous girlfriend was an ardent feminist and despite my respect for her views, I'm never bringing up circumcision to her again. Every conversation we had where I managed to bring it up and hint that I was disappointed with my own and felt cheated out of a choice I have a definite preference on, she moved the topic of conversation to bodily autonomy issues women faced instead. It was clear from our conversations that while she thought men should be given a choice in the matter, there were more pertinent problems at hand and the ""successful"" outcome of many circumcisions didn't warrant much outrage. I'm glad I'm out of that relationship but the lack of understanding and empathy combined with the dismissive attitude towards men speaking out against circumcision really broke my trust in someone who claimed to be for equality. 


And lastly, those restoring their foreskins well are - at times - another source of negative conversations. Simply because these are often filled with sadness and grief. Restoring, as it currently stands, won't ever fully replace the original foreskin. There are certain structures and nerve endings that simply won't make a return - there's never a way to feel 100% whole. This is something I'm not prepared to face head on in the coming months - as much as my journey will lead me where I want to be, I'll still never be able to fully rectify the choices others have made, and that's painful.



I really don't know where this post was going. I'm just frustrated. This is a topic I feel like I can't discuss anymore lest I be laughed out of the room or dismissed for being oversensitive. I don't think I'll bring up to anyone close to me - let alone my therapist. I'm hoping someday in the future it can be discussed more freely, or at least with less judgment among men, but until then I'll just be here, quietly trying to look how I want to look.



Edit: this is reposted due to some issues with the subreddit rules.


Also, to answer a question from a user - the most common method of foreskin restoration involves placing tension on the foreskin in order to encourage skin growth. Over time (were talking months to years), the skin will lengthen and eventually be able to cover the glans. Surgery is another option but involves obvious complications from skin grafting and the delicate operation.",1.0,567.0,0.95,628.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jvwotg/ive_recently_committed_to_restoring_my_foreskin/,girlytransthrowaway

Fanon and Gwendolyn Brooks for the smooth-skinned sociology major who. never gave me a second. look; Foucault and Woolf for the ethereal bisexual who wore mostly black. As a strategy for picking up girls, my pseudo-intellectualism proved mostly worthless; I found myself in a series of affectionate but chaste friendships.”

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/7c849p/big_boys_dont_cry_when_became_strong_emotions_in/dpoaqcn 


I had thought that we had previous answers on this topic, but when I looked, they were all bounded to specific periods rather than exploring the change, so you get a fresh new one.

Contrary to the assertions in many of the now-removed comments, masculinity and tears have not always been at odds. I am not prepared to discuss when this began, but in the Middle Ages there was a trope of masculine weeping being a mark of religious devotion and knightly chivalry; by the sixteenth century it was well-established that a masculine man was supposed to have deep emotions and to show them - in some cases, through tears. Masculinity is not inherently constructed as relating primarily to brute strength and stoicism, although it's common for people to think that it is out of presentism (inserting modern values into the past), as well as a view that the past was when ""men were men"" and the modern version of masculinity is therefore a watered-down version of a previous version. 

The early modern British conceptualization of masculinity rested instead upon a range of virtues, from the more obvious strength, bravery, and honorable reputation to honesty, prudence, and self-sufficiency, with interpretations of which were more important differing based on how much patriarchal power and what kind of it different groups of men had. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, the virtues of politeness and self-restraint came to the fore. A gentleman was to be courteous to women and other men, to talk problems out, to keep from bursting into loud displays of anger or drunkenness. You might think that that would also put the kibosh on weeping - giving way to feelings of all sorts - but this was not the case. Another gentlemanly trait of the eighteenth century was sensibility, which today sounds like it ought to mean ""rationality"", but is actually being aware of and susceptible to one's finer emotions. This was frequently represented in sentimental novels of the period in ways similar to those you've noted in your question: they weep out of sadness and pity, and sometimes faint when the emotion they feel becomes too much. (That being said, women were generally conceded to have a greater amount of natural sensibility than men on average.) Down the social scale into the middle classes, standards of politeness were more informal and concerns more restricted to physically-restrained conduct, and we have very little idea of what constituted 'masculinity"" in a working-class context.

Tears started to become more strongly feminized in the nineteenth century, and it appears to happen first with boys at school. Through the middle of the century, it was still acceptable for men to weep in their own grief, gratitude, or pity, or, for instance, while watching an emotional scene in a play or melodrama - Dickens once noted that he ""invariably [began] to cry whenever anybody on the stage forgives an enemy or gives away a pocket-book"". It was even laudable, to middle- and upper-class observers, when working-class men showed their humanity by crying at appropriate times. At the same time, an incident of schoolyard bullying in David Copperfield involves one student standing up for another and weeping to some extent as he does so, which results in a caning from a teacher and feminizing mockery from the bully: the student is definitely portrayed as being in the right, and we know that Dickens was a supporter of male tears, but in the context of a Victorian boys' boarding school showing emotion was simply not done. Other narratives of boarding and day schools bear out the same principle of self-restraint in the face of sensibility, with not ""blubbing"" in the face of beating being a point of pride and the people one missed from home being never mentioned except to your closest friends in private, and parenting manuals began to preach that children cried to manipulate and must learn to control themselves and their emotions.

The concept of the ""stiff upper lip"" - originally an Americanism! - started to become a key part of British identity in the 1870s and 1880s, as the children who'd faced this scholastic experience replaced the previous generation of adults and the so-called ""cult of sensibility"" completely died away, to be replaced with stoic self-restraint. Even outside of Britain, obvious tears from men and boys were seen as embarrassing. Men were to be utterly ""rational"" instead of emotional, or, more modernly put, were to value reals over feels. To not do this was to be unmasculine and womanly - and while male effeminacy had been a concern for a long time, this is the period that saw real ""scientific"" attention paid to issues of gender and sexuality, as well as more public discourse on the same, which could lead to serious consequences for the unmasculine man.

I assumed men's day would be along the lines of women's Day, be used to celebrate the men in each other's lives and lift us up and talk about your heroes or even the issues men Face. I made a post as such and saw a few lovely ones from men talking about their role models, women sharing lovely tribute posts about their husbands and son's and the like. 

But I've now noticed most of the top posts on social media, mainly Instagram, have become those from women for (one example) celebrating the ""allies"" who are helping them smash the patriarchy. Or using it as a day to help smash toxic masculinity as another example and listing all the things men can do to help that. 

I mean it is nice if you appreciate that, but is that really what today is about?

I've gotten women giving me weird looks before or under breath comments, but today was different. I was in a Dicks sports store with my 4 year old.  He was just on the other side of the short 4 foot display with me plainly in sight.  A woman came over and asked where his mommy was.  I said that he was my son.  She scowled at me and asked him again where his mommy was.  He said at home.  I went over and grabbed his hand shuffling him away from her.  I repeated that he was my son.  She left in a huff. 

It's so weird, I've heard stories like this before, but I didn't think it would happen to me. 

There is something wrong with society that a father gets questioned like this.  I've posted before here about my troubles finding changing tables in men's rooms while my boys were in diapers. It's like we cannot accept that fathers could be out, taking care of their kids.

2020-11-20 01:05:05,Towards better Men’s Health: Let’s get the “MENtion It” movement going.,"[A study by Cleveland Clinic](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/mention-it-mens-health/?utm_campaign=mentionit-url&amp;utm_medium=offline&amp;utm_source=redirect&amp;utm_content=&amp;cvosrc=offline.redirect.mentionit-url) found something that, likely, a lot of us know firsthand all too well: 
**Almost two-thirds of male patients** said they **avoid going to the doctor as long as possible,** and 37 percent said they understate their condition from their physicians.

I admit, even as a specialist doctor, I too had moments when I underestimate my symptoms of my illness. I put off seeking medical attention as long as possible, convincing myself that small stuff don’t really bother me because **I tend to think: well, they’ll improve on their own.**

*Wrong.*

There is an omnipresent negative attitude of men towards seeking healthcare. 

Sometimes we fear a bad diagnosis. 

Sometimes it’s a particularly bad case of superhero syndrome.

Sometimes an embarrassing stigma holds us back from fully telling the doc what’s really bothering us.

And man is it difficult to unlearn all that.

But I hope that doesn’t deter us from trying.

Almost all illness in the world will be treated so much quicker and better when it’s detected on the early stage. It’s really beneficial for all of us.

Furthermore, please believe me that anamnesis (i.e. doctor-patient interview) makes roughly 70-80% of our differential and final diagnosis. That’s how important valuable your recount is. Our physical exam and lab workups are only done more or less to confirm what we hear from you. Therefore an accurate assessment is only possible with full patient cooperation. 

**Men, there is nothing more based than being completely honest about your health concerns.**

Being healthy is the shit. As early as possible, and as much you can, if you got health concerns: **MENtion It!**

Stay safe and Happy International Men’s Day, my good fellas.

2020-11-20 02:23:44,A quote of Obama's Definition of Masculinity,"&gt; Trump, Obama noted, is not exactly an exemplar of traditional American manhood. “I think about the classic male hero in American culture when you and I were growing up: the John Waynes, the Gary Coopers, the Jimmy Stewarts, the Clint Eastwoods, for that matter. There was a code … the code of masculinity that I grew up with that harkens back to the ’30s and ’40s and before that. There’s a notion that a man is true to his word, that he takes responsibility, that he doesn’t complain, that he isn’t a bully—in fact he defends the vulnerable against bullies. And so even if you are someone who is annoyed by wokeness and political correctness and wants men to be men again and is tired about everyone complaining about the patriarchy, I thought that the model wouldn’t be Richie Rich—the complaining, lying, doesn’t-take-responsibility-for-anything type of figure.”

I'm not one to attribute characteristics to gender because every time I do, I find myself asking ""Why can't women be that too?"" but if I had to attribute a idea of masculinity, I would respect Obama's definition.

My parents constantly told me to shave it off to the point where they joked they were going to pin me down and remove it themselves. Mystery birthday gifts became razors and scissors. The only people that tended to be supportive were my male friends and male colleagues. Some of them actually encouraged me to to keep going and made comments of admiration.

Once my female boss had enough and made it quite clear, by then I got so fed up with all the criticism, that I began removing my beard. To be fair, by this stage the hair was getting quite annoying and hard to manage. I found it hard keeping it combed, straightened, and sanitary. Food and drink had to be consumed carefully. And when I woke up in the morning sometimes had a split bent beard!

I thought about this again recently. I remember distinctly feeling sad at losing my beard. It grew to be a part of my identity, and removing it felt like cutting off a limb. It was endearing when a little kid would call you Thor or something. It also gave me something to grow out when my hair was balding.

I thought about the call of late for other protected characteristics like being a Goth, or having tattoos/piercings ect. Employers can particularly hostile to nonconformity in regards to dress code and looks. But with beards, we are so far behind when it comes to this kind of stuff.

2020-11-22 04:38:25,Shame about liking traditional beauty standards?,"During the pandemic I've been thinking a lot about the kind of people I find attractive. I'm a mostly straight cis dude who is involved in the queer community. I feel some shame about the people I find attractive because I know the standards that have informed me have been toxic.   In a relationship I find physical attraction lower on the list than emotional connection, yet it still informs my decision-making. 


In the day to day I feel like when I'm on an app swiping on women or talking to them I can't help but notice the types I match with meet a traditional beauty standard.   
When I think about what I find attractive or when I'm attracted to people I find it sits somewhat closely to traditional, untenable beauty standards.  
The porn I consume is mostly petite bodies or girls with large asses or busts.  


On one hand I think yo myself ""you like what you like"" and on the other I feel shame. I feel that I've been at least a bit brainwashed about what is ""attractive"". I didn't find much by searching, but I may have not been searching for the right things. Has anyone grappled with thoughts like this?

2020-11-23 03:13:17,Confessions of an unmasculine black man,"It didn't take me very long even as a kid to realize that I didn't really fit the societal image of what a black man should be. But I thought that maybe I'd grow into it as a got older. I just turned 32, and no such luck.

I never did grow into common cultural image of black men as tall, muscular, sexy, confident and a large penis, **MASCULINE**. Masculinity is like a defining trait for black men. Instead I'm short, geeky with a smaller than average penis(and not just the ""black men average"").

I never even thought about it too much until a former partner of mine told her friend ( who thought I should know), her surprise that I had a ""*pencil dick*"". Doing tons of internet research, only to find out she was right, was very devastating to my self worth. Black men are synonymous with large penises. It's our trademark. What makes us special. I've never felt so uniquely unlovable.

That, and I'm also a coward. The thought of getting into a fight frightens me. I know protection is something that women value highly, but even being in the presence of a fight makes gives me heart palpitations, and weak knees. 

I'm so insecure, I've even begun to think I'd rather not have kids incase I end up with a boy. I'd hate to give them my genetic short comings. And even if I didn't, would I end up being jealous of them?

2020-11-23 03:44:33,MGM and Masculinity in African countries,"Hi r/menslib, I'm a woman living in a country in East Africa, I've been a feminist for a long time, so such topics interest me.

I recently started dating a very sweet African man (more on that later), who comes from one of the major tribes in our country. In fact it is the largest tribe. I didn't know that much about their culture before but I am learning. So one day he tells me that he is going to this ceremony, and basically what happened is that a boy in his family got circumcised, and that they were holding an after party (it's a traditional thing). 

I asked him more about it and he told me that it was a rite of passage to 'becoming a man' and that boys in their community get circumcised at around 14, and that it is extremely painful. Unfortunately because it's seen as a rite of passage most of the boys actually agree to  it even though it's extremely painful. Since I'm a woman I've never gone through it but I'm an Indian-Arab person, and for us it usually happens when the baby boy is 6 months old which is not good either BUT atleast it's not as painful as it happening when you are around 14 years old. 

But the thing is they do it because they say it makes you a man. Which I don't actually agree with because growing up and ideally being a good person makes you a man, not circumcision. I voiced my objections but I didn't want to argue with my SO. 

P,S if you check my post history you might come across me saying I'm a lesbian, I'm only 19 and recently my sexuality changed, so that is why I'm now dating a man, so please have compassion for me, as sexuality is complicated, but I just wanted to say this incase anyone got confused.",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensLib/comments/jz20eh/mgm_and_masculinity_in_african_countries/,JackieNaper1907

2020-11-25 11:02:18,Sometimes I wish men’s issues could be talked about without people assuming you’re a part of some radical misogynist group and therefore reinforcing the male conditioning surrounding prohibiting emotions and vulnerability / talking about your problems,"Basically title. Like part of this I feel comes from how politicized and polarized everything and everyone has become largely due to social media algorithms over the last 10 years. It’s like we can’t just have a conversation with another person and them not assume a very extreme context. E.g. talking about men’s issues? Must be a radical “red pill-er” or something (or that other one that’s ends in like “TOW” or something I don’t remember).

Granted this goes for many things these as genuine conversation between differing sides has become increasingly difficult, however it’s sad to me how aware I am how this also happens to reinforce the male conditioning and wounding around prohibiting emotion, vulnerability or talking about your problems (or also needing help from others? —&gt; opposite to the hyper individualism in the male script).

Like some things I have become increasingly aware of is how truly bad online dating is for men and how socially isolated so many men are as well. So it’s like, can’t get a girlfriend and also can’t get regular guy friends. I guess everyone is isolated during these Covid times of course and nobody in particular is doing great generally.. But especially as a psychologist and a man I am increasingly afraid of where I see these trends going for the next 10 years. And I think part of the problem will be that men’s issues are taboo to talk about, on top of men already being conditioned to suppress their emotions, needs or vulnerabilities.

Some particular concerns I have surround how due to online dating women end up becoming pickier (because of the massive difference between how many matches they get and how many men get) while men feel they must be less discerning or choosy. In addition to women proportionally raising their standards, with the current times, fewer and fewer men are able to match even the standards of better times (economically / societally etc.). E.g. it is much more unrealistic or difficult or you have to be privileged a lot to be able to live on your own, i.e. “have your own place,” make a living wage, or raise your head above water to have a sort of ambition or creative drive women might be attracted to. Hope this makes sense what I’m saying.

And if this isn’t clear let me just say I’m not trying to blame anyone, as I am not one much for any “us vs them” sort of lens, I just wanted to get this off my chest a bit. Wonder if anyone else has considered some of these same angles and factors like I have?",1.0,1.0,1.0,64.0,/r/MensLib/comments/k0jty0/sometimes_i_wish_mens_issues_could_be_talked/,IntrospectThyself

I only have a couple hand me down dumbells from my dad (4kg and 8kg) and I find the heavier ones a real struggle. 

Which is just embarrassing to me. I don't even go near the weights when I go to one of the locak gyms because I feel self conscious about it.

When I used to attempt it in the gym, I'd see myself in the mirror and just stop, thinking ""I look like a fucking moron"" before putting the weight away and doing something else.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensLib/comments/k1maa8/what_do_you_do_to_get_over_that_i_look_like_an/,JamieT0

2020-11-28 00:00:10,"Developing and Expressing my Sexuality, What makes you feel like a Sexual Person?","so I'm a 24 yo Bi man and as a teen I was on anti anxiety meds that had crushed all sexual and romantic desire within me. Since getting off them and growing into my own I've recently realized that I have no idea how to express my sexuality in its entirety. 

 I'm finally at a comfortable spot to show this side of myself though and wanted to ask other men what helps them express and feel like the sexual person they are. 

what clothes or styles make you feel good? 

how do you like to flirt with others? 

how I can enjoy this while being cognizant and respectful of others boundaries?

 and whatever advice you have for a kid just trying to regain a part of himself

&amp;#x200B;

I want to be clear because its been a bit of confusion with IRL friends I'm not looking at this journey as a way to pick people up or help my chances with dates, but to develop and realize an authentic part of myself that for too long was neglected.

&amp;#x200B;

I tend to naturally fall in the more Het end of presentation and culture but I'd love to invite and hear any of your discussion on healthy male sexual expression, whether it's on the more masculine or feminine end, whether is subtle or boisterous.",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,/r/MensLib/comments/k23qto/developing_and_expressing_my_sexuality_what_makes/,Mushea

2020-11-28 00:54:17,[US-based] Activism opportunity: Support incarcerated people this December by participating in your local card-writing campaign,"I am posting this here because prisons are places which are particularly affected by pressures towards certain performances of masculinity, and LGBTQ+ people can therefore be particularly vulnerable; and because I know a lot of people on here are involved in these sorts of projects or interested in becoming involved.

[Black &amp; Pink](https://www.blackandpink.org/), a prison abolitionist organization that connects incarcerated LGBTQ+ people to penpals on the outside, is [inviting folks to send holiday cards to incarcerated people](https://www.blackandpink.org/penpal-newsletter/). They are asking participants to send cards to 15 people. You don't need to provide a return address if you don't want a penpal relationship (in fact they encourage people only to have 2 penpals at a time).

There are online card-writing events across the US to support this work, which you can find through facebook searches. There's one in NYC, New Jersey, Detroit, Chicago, and more -- I don't want to link directly to events to avoid trolling, but feel free to PM me for details :) And if you can't find one in your area, let me know if you'd like help or advice hosting your own!",1.0,1.0,1.0,3.0,/r/MensLib/comments/k24s2o/usbased_activism_opportunity_support_incarcerated/,lagomorpheme
2020-11-28 01:19:18,Children's Books and Literary Roll Models,"Our children are avid readers, and as a family, we listen to audiobooks together frequently. I've found a wealth of books that involve female protagonists in stories that have healthy, whole person characteristics in both male and female characters. However, I'm having a far, far harder time finding books like that with male protagonists. It seems like nearly everyone who is writing with pro-feminism, anti-patriarchy world views are only writing with girl leads. All of my kids can appreciate these stories, and I'm happy our sons and daughter has a much more balanced literary world than what my partner and I grew up with. I'd really like to find more positive gender characterizations with male leads, especially fantasy, since that is the kids' favorite genre. Gender and sexuality themes would also be appreciated.
