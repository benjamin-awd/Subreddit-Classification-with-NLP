23/11/2020 3:22,How feminist shaming tactics needlessly cause lasting sexual repression or guilt in a subset of men most sympathetic to feminist concerns.,"A crosspost from /r/LeftWingMaleAdvocates  Because I felt like a lot of people there resonated with this post and I would like to share it more.

When I was a young man I saw myself as a proud feminist. I thought, ""what kind of person wouldn't stand up for women's rights?"" I had no problem with wearing pink t-shirts, having female friends, or stereotypically feminine interests like playing princess or having tea parties. Though, as I got older, borders seemed to vanish. I even remember playing barbies with my neighbors so much, one year I asked my parents for a barbie dream carriage for Christmas. And they got it for me. They were super progressive about this stuff. But I was also bullied heavily for a number of reasons. And come high school, there was an elective course on women's studies offered.

And the girls enrolled in it. And used what they learned as a bludgeon to bully the guys they didn't like. It wasn't just that they disliked the guy who asked them out awkwardly. Now, he was a creepy entitled misogynist objectifying them. Any guy they didn't like who talked about girls and his attraction to them (as hormone-filled teenage boys do) were labeled as sexual abusers and predators. The message we got was clear: ""As a man, you do NOT show your interest unless she expresses hers first.""

And remember. Men shoulder almost the entirety of social pressure to approach and initiate. We're not given a manual on how to do this. So it's going to be awkward sometimes. Please don't hate us or shame us for that.

as a guy we don't get the luxury to wait on the sidelines for someone to approach us. For the most part girls will not initiate dates or ask us out or approach first

So if we don't want to be alone. we have to approach and initiate. And we have to do so right off the bat. Lest we be seen ""hiding our intentions""

That constant rejection shit grinds us down. And some guys don't react well after dealing with that. and lash out. And I'm sorry for that. But it's not like we want it to be this way.

In a more egalitarian society this imbalance wouldn't exist. Women wouldn't feel restrained for whatever reason to not openly express their interest and men wouldn't feel the constant need to always have this ""i have to impress the girl"" mode on.

I internalized this for years and it pushed me into a number of abusive and manipulative ""friendships"" with people who used me. Because all we're left with for ways to express interest is being nice or being deceptive.

(This probably wasn't the intended result, but I have never seen the people teaching these classes offer a disclaimer that men weren't the enemy or that male sexuality wasn't horrible, or that women weren't the victim.)

And I dealt with the results of internalizing that up until this right around this year. I watched everybody around me build families. Find love. Struggle through tough times with a partner to lean on. All the while I had nothing. Because nobody was expressing interest in me and I was terrified of doing so first. I struggled through poverty. Through mental health issues that nearly had me taking my own life.

I noticed something else. The friends I had, that were struggling like me, they had help. When one of my guy friends lost his job, his girlfriend and now wife took over while he was looking. When another friend was struggling to make ends meet while trying to go back to school to better themselves, her boyfriend worked so she could study. I had none of that because I was given the message that my desires and sexuality were disgusting and unwanted and I internalized it.

And who wouldn't internalize it in my shoes? These people were academic authorities, sounding so self-assured and believable, with scientific-sounding arguments and fire in their eyes.

Up until this year, I struggled with this issue until I finally snapped. I decided that I was going to stop caring about being a monster., I was going to find somebody online and just push my ""toxic desires"" onto them. I was going to pressure them with my predatory sexuality and stop giving a fuck about if they thought I was creepy. And so I did. And they reciprocated my interest. They WANTED my interest, they LIKED that I desired them sexually. We hooked up. And then we dated. It didn't last very long. But it still happened. And we're still friends.

And I'm not the only one who has noticed this. 

These are great reads on their own if you want. But I'll single out the most important bits for what I'm saying here.

>I’m a woman. I’m gay. By the time I realized that second thing, I’d internalized that all attraction to women was objectifying and therefore evil. I spent years of my life convinced that it was coercive to make it clear to girls that I wanted to date them, lest they feel pressured. So I could only ask them out with a clear conscience if I was in fact totally indifferent to their answer. I still decide I’m abusive pretty frequently, on the basis of things like ‘i want to kiss her, which is what an abuser would want’ and 'i want to be special to her, which is what an abuser would want’.

>I internalized these messages from exposure to feminist memes, norms, and communities. It was feminist messages, not homophobic ones, that made it hardest for me to come to terms with my sexuality. It wasn’t intentional. But it happened. And it has happened by now to enough people that 'well obviously you’re misinterpreting it’ is starting to wear thin as an excuse. Lots and lots of people are misinterpreting the way I did. By and large, we’re vulnerable people. Very often we’re mentally ill or disabled people.

>Here’s the thing: I spent my formative years—basically, from the age of 12 until my mid-20s—feeling not “entitled,” not “privileged,” but terrified. I was terrified that one of my female classmates would somehow find out that I sexually desired her, and that the instant she did, I would be scorned, laughed at, called a creep and a weirdo, maybe even expelled from school or sent to prison. And furthermore, that the people who did these things to me would somehow be morally right to do them—even if I couldn’t understand how.

>You can call that my personal psychological problem if you want, but it was strongly reinforced by everything I picked up from my environment: to take one example, the sexual-assault prevention workshops we had to attend regularly as undergrads, with their endless lists of all the forms of human interaction that “might be” sexual harassment or assault, and their refusal, ever, to specify anything that definitely wouldn’t be sexual harassment or assault. I left each of those workshops with enough fresh paranoia and self-hatred to last me through another year.

>Feminism can exacerbate a man’s shyness, anxiety, self-consciousness, and guilt exactly because he is working very hard not to be sexist, and because he is sympathetic to feminism. Just as some workers, even conscientious ones, have trouble getting work done out of a perfectionistic fear of making mistakes, some men, even pro-feminist men or proto-feminist men, have trouble interacting with women out of a fear of making what feminism defines as mistakes (it doesn’t help that feminism’s criteria for acceptable behavior and so ambiguous and vague, and fail to clearly distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior, but that’s a whole different post).

And to sum them all up. A quote about all three. https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/01/01/untitled/

>Scott Aaronson is a straight guy, and he’s saying feminist shaming tactics have made it worse. I’m an asexual heteroromantic guy, and I’m telling her feminist shaming tactics have made it worse. Unitofcaring is a lesbian woman, and she’s saying feminist shaming tactics have made it worse. HughRistik, who is some sort of weird metrosexual something (I mock him because I love him), is telling her feminist shaming tactics have made it worse. A giant cry has arisen from shy awkward men, lesbians, bisexuals, whatever of the world is saying “NO, SERIOUSLY, FEMINIST SHAMING TACTICS ARE MAKING THIS WORSE”

The government justification was:

* ""***It is estimated*** that women make up 53 per cent of directly affected industries and 65 per cent of secondary industries impacted by the pandemic."" (Estimated? By Whom? How?)
* Therefore, women are the most affected.
* Therefore, no benefits should go to men regardless of how desperate their need.

Obviously, you'd need to be a Men's Rights extremist to disagree with the last point. But there's a big jump to the second point as well. I wondered why no one is quoting the data since it's readily available. Maybe women are, in fact, only slightly worse off...

So, I looked.

Guys we are so screwed. For every extra woman unemployed in the last 12 months, 2.75 men have become unemployed. To look at it another way, male unemployment has increased by 2.4% while female unemployment has only increased by 0.9%. So, these benefits are being withheld from the people most effected.

If you don't believe me, look on the ABS web site for data series A84423494R, A84423718R, A84423490F & A84423714F. I looked at variations on this analysis but it all comes out the same. Note, though, that I'm quoting figures for the state of NSW since that's the state introducing the grant. A quick glance suggests a more mixed picture in other states.

My conclusion is that, if the government bothered to use some creative numbers & indirect arguments rather than the actual stats, they knew the money was being misdirected. It could be coincidental that the state Premier (like a Governor in the US) has been caught in some misdeeds lately that would have resulted in any male being sacked. But she discovered that she was a feminist all along & the sisterhood in the press have rallied around.

28/11/2020 13:07,Say this when feminist say that women get lighter sentences since women are seen as inferior to men.,"Why were black men's sentences so much longer than the white men's decades ago and still nowadays in some cases.

**Is it because black men were seen as superior to white men, or because black men were (unjustly) all seen as criminals/rapists, more disposable and less valuable to society?**

With this \^\^\^, the typical feminist would have a huge contradiction in her brain:

OPTIONS: 1. She'll stop and maybe reflect 2. She'll start screaming to silence you and silence your rationality since most people's egos are too big to accept defeat, to learn from their mistakes to grow as human beings.

{Judging an individual based on stats of a large group of people} is wrong. It is sexism/racism. Men and women both have bad apples. But men, have testosterone in their blood. It has been shown in studies and is common sense to most people with IQs over 60 that testosterone makes people **a little** more aggressive and risk taking. Emphasis on **little more**.

Most men and women are similar and hormonal differences doesn't make them soo much different. If you chose a random man and woman, the chance that one is more aggressive than the other isn't much different according to gender.

But, when it comes to extremes, these small differences are amplified. This is because normal distributions aren't straight lines, but curves that taper down at the ends (extremes). So, when it comes to rape or violent crimes, men will be the more common ones to commit it,  but you know the catch, these men make up a very tiny small percentage of ALL men in society. So judging all men because of 0.01% of men isn't right.

Both genders have bad people. The bad people in the male gender have testosterone which gives them this extra push to commit more physical violent crimes. This doesn't mean those bad women aren't bad. About the same percentage of women are capable of lying about a rape case to put a man 25 years in jail  (since these crimes aren't physical or violent) and the thing is that it may be a lot more common since they don't even have the pressure of the LAW (something that these male rapists have which will decrease males raping females). Most women who falsely accuse men, knowing that they can ruin their lives, that they can make these innocent men spend decades in jails who are **CAUGHT BY THE LAW** have few weeks in probation as punishment.

If I was a psychopathic woman who was angry against a man, I have literally 0 reason to not falsely accuse an innocent man, since I can ruin his life with close to **ZERO RISK**.

Basically at the school I go to a twitter account was started where people anonymously accuse men of rape and after those people are accused others often dox them in the comments (usually by posting their linkedin) and try to get them thrown out of school or fired from their jobs/internships.

The account has reached over 12k followers and anyone who questions their methods gets blocked by them despite the fact that multiple allegations that they posted have already been proven false and not too long ago a young man committed suicide after being falsely accused on a similar allegation style twitter.

A massive retreat into digital media, videogames and pornography is underway. Men are becoming sedentary, timid, and subservient to the women in their lives. Women are growing repulsed and disillusioned with the males in their enviornments, as their hypergamous instinct drives them to seek and demand higher and higher standards for men, and almost without missing a beat, in 2020, the already exorbitant male suicide rate just climbed to a two decade high.

* Do you think about the years of life and freedom that you lost ?
* Do you think about what would happen in time of conflict ? Or about the fact that you were forced sign to give control over your body and life ? Did they insist on the fact that you have to defend your country and give your life for it during the training ?

>But more generally, in case anyone else has also forgotten what this all was even about: It's about [Mary P. Koss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_P._Koss),   and the IP's efforts to make our article on her be all about one   particular not-widely-held opinion she once espoused, to the exclusion   of all else she did. [This medium post](https://medium.com/@Ssudborough/where-mras-and-feminists-have-common-ground-and-why-its-so-frustrating-that-they-aren-t-feminists-d59ba015086)   (also not a reliable source) describes both the context for this   specific effort regarding Koss and the broader rhetorical point that   this is in service of: falsely pretending that Koss's opinion is both   representative of feminism and widely influential as a way for   men's-rights advocates to attack feminism and the people she supposedly   influenced. — 04:37, 3 September 2020 (UTC)

First of all, no one mentioned excluding *anything,* in fact the entire page of that monster is filled with talk of her  (purportedly) academic credentials and awards. That is what it is, and however illegitimate and anti-scientific that may be, the fallacies of  social constructivism is a different issue. Even Trump has a  views-section (e.g. ""Racial views"") that are relevant to his person.

The fact that the opinions she *still*  holds (by evidence of a 2015 radio interview) aren't widely held is  obvious - but it's not a point in defence for her. On the contrary, according to Wikipedia's own rules, if it's of interest to a  ""significant minority"" (in this case, males, absurdly enough), then it  has a place in the article.

He then goes on to discredit the addition of the various atrocities she  champions (all of which can be read in the history-section) because it's a *""broader rhetorical point that  this is in service of: falsely pretending that Koss's opinion is both representative of feminism and widely influential as a way for  men's-rights advocates to attack feminism""*, and he motivates that based on that feminist opinion piece from the medium-post he links to.

The medium-article he uses as a reference for his actions amongst others contains the following:

>I  want to begin my discussion of this topic by saying that there is one  common MRA viewpoint on the sexual violence towards men that I have   chosen to omit for discussion because I found it so vile and despicable  that it is not worth giving any ounce of legitimacy by taking the time   to debunk an outrageous and evil claim such as this one. If you would   like to know what it is, you are welcome to PM me about it.

Suffice it to say, both the article he quotes and he himself has a bias for  feminism (he has personally participated in women's rights-drives) and  against males' rights.

Whatever his ideas regarding the males' rights-movement are, and whatever bias he holds for feminism, the Koss-article is incomplete without mentioning  her utterly despicable acts and beliefs.

In short, recently two topics have been pushed a lot by my uni's social committee: women and racism. Men's international day was a few days ago and we had no single mention about it, no mention about depression which in my country is a huge issue (depression in general, but men statistically are the most affected gender).

I have no issues if they want to talk about domestic violence, it is an issue. But why are they limiting the topic to WOMEN ONLY? In here it is very common for women to be bossy at home and to complain about everything their husbands do, leading to big arguments. Why can't I talk about it being a way of psychological domestic violence that leads to the depression issue I've mentioned above?

For a while I've been here, I've never felt privileged for being a man (in some situations it was rather the opposite) so the 1st time I had a conversation with a feminist I got so pissed at her arguments that I ended up finding this and enjoying the content. However, most of the news shared here is from the US, in Portugal we don't have the same unfair alimony laws and child custody fights depend a lot on the kid's wishes, I've always thought things in my country would never get to the toxic extreme you guys have in there. Stuff like this e-mail makes me realize we are just behind the clock a bit, it's a matter of time.

27/11/2020 6:38,"So, why has feminism become such an unpopular word ?","The male rights movement is often targeted for criticism. I think, many people here know, why its necessary that we have a supporting movement fighting for our rights, but with the huge overflow of criticism, it sometimes is hard to explain the flaws of feminism. I tried to sum up some valid talking points for people who intend to have constructive discussions on that topic, and would like some basic suggestoins, especially with people who either think the mens rights movement is unnecessary or even think, political feminists care about important male rights issues at all.

As  a  man living in the west, I've grown up in socially  turbulent times. Over the last 10 (-ish) years, I've noticed an  enlarging rift between men and women, and a shrinking readyness to  listen to each others problems.  Yet, most people seem to be interested  in an equal society. So, why do so many people oppose feminism while  still claiming to be all for equal rights? Are they truly hypocritical  or do they have valid reasons? I looked for talking points outside from  the popular, political voices, like here on reddit, and here is what I  concluded:

&#x200B;

* **There are a lot of different categorys, which confuses people**

and  there isn't really a common ground between them. So, while private  feminism actually falls into the equal rights category, there are more  radical branches, which are smaller but also louder, but when questioned  quickly hide behind the same definitions the non-radical feminists use.  This results in people from outside the movement believing, that the  whole movement supports the mindset of the loud, radical minority,  which, on the other hand creates mistrust, especially for people who  suffered from it.

&#x200B;

* **Feminism has a certain status of being above criticism**

And  being above criticism results in rampantly growing fundamentalism. This  is also the cause for the first point. There is a certain culture of  delegitimizing everything opposing feminism, no matter how valid (and  necessary) it is. This also drives moderate people farer away. In the  scientific community, criticism is not only be accepted but wished, the  same standard should apply to feminism.

&#x200B;

* **Feminists often excuse sexism when its not targeted against women**

and  especially, when it is sexism caused by men against men, but also from  women against men. This point hits especially hard by a movement  claiming to be **against**  sexism. Statements like ""the higher victimization rate of violent crime  is no real problem since it is also caused by men"" or even ""prison rape  is not bad since its caused by men"" are common not only in radical  feminism circles but also from moderate voices. Actually, I decided to  make this post after reading a highly agreed statement like the above on  reddit. Segregating victims into groups depending on the victim's, and  the perpetrator's identity is highly problematic and a big no go for  many people.

&#x200B;

* **Feminsim's Profiteurs (especially politicians and brands) often redefine statistics and facts for their personal gain**

This  is a more complex point, so I will only briefly address it. In my  country, women's first election is celebrated by feminists in the year  1918. What is forgotten, and nearly funny, is that it was also men's  first election, since until then, it was a monarchy. Another example is  the common notion that women, in the medieval times were mere property,  to gain sympathy. However, in this violent period of time in feudal  europe, nearly everyone, including men, was property to their feudal  lord, that was the system back then, and as women had no rights or  freedom, so didn't have the men, and the fate of nearly every person  was decided by the lord of the land they lived in. While women were  basically **forced** to be livelong incubators, men were either **forced**  to be livelong working slaves or meat shields to their  lord/baron/duke/king/emperorer on whose land they were born (of course  this is a bit simplified). Neither of them had the freedom to decide for  themselves, and those who opposed those power systems were simply got  rid off. So what is basically portrayed as a gender struggle was, in  reality, more of a class struggle.

The  same twisting of information goes for a range of popular statistical  facts. Whether it is the gender pay gap, the 1 in 4 college women are  raped or the pink tax, there are a lot of really popular myths out there  which will cause a headache in every professionial surveyor, since they  result from misinterpretation/misrepresentation of statistical  calculations and polls.

If you  trace back these myths to its sources, you will most likely land in a  political or financial institution, who used the spreading of this myth  for financial gain or to collect more votes from people with whom those  'facts' resonated. The harm this does is innumerable, since it not only  turns people aginst one another, but also damages people (men and women)  by damaging their self worth.

&#x200B;

* **Feminists take away the accountability of adults when it doesn't fit the agenda**

especially  when it is a women's decision to live a more traditional live. Women,  far more often decide to work part-time, do unpaid care work or stay at  home completely, thus enforcing stereotypes and the wage gap etc. . We  live in a free society, where they have every right to do so, but no one  forces them to. Of course, this point is highly debatably, since  sometime, a certain situation can force someone into doing something  they'd rather not, but still, their are no legal obligations which force women into these common patterns. Childcare is a different topic, but again, the laws regarding that affect men and women.

&#x200B;

* **There is no discussion about female privilege**

yet,  after 100 years of reminding men to check their privileges, it is time  to check their own. Privileges are, by definition advantages you have  been given your whole life by your status, thus having a hard time  reflecting about them when no one clarifies them for you. There is an ongoing public discussion about male privilege for decades now, but when  men point out situations in which they felt a women having an advantage  over them just for being a woman, it is, most of the time, simply  brushed off. There is a huge list of female-only advantages, be it on  social, judical or on business scale. There are many women who acknowledge  their privileges, however, the onesided public discussion makes it hard  or even impossible for girls and young women to reflect about how they  interact, and how others interact with them. This especially hurts women  as well, since on one side it hinders them from utilizing career-based  possibilities they have through their priviliges, and (as i often have  experienced at university myself) decreases their self worth and  stopping them from applying for a high paying industry position, even  though in the current industry-climate in Europe and the USA, there is a  2 to 1 chance in favour of women for applications for higher paying  jobs.

&#x200B;

Of  course, there are many, many more points, but for me, these here seemed  especially useful for a portrayal of why people choose egalitarism over  feminism.  For many people, feminism doesn't qualify for more than a  female superiority movement anymore, since for being an equality  movement, would need to fight against societal issues on both ends, not  just for women's. Of course \[on the global scale\] there are many issues that still need to be  done for women's rights, but especially in the west, there are a lot of  male rights issues (especially regarding the **draft**, a form of UN-legitamized slavery, **family court rights** , **certain reproductive rights** regarding non-medical infant circumcision, which also violates human rights, paternity rights or parental consent rights, and many more) many feminists can't even name. As long as there is no  shift in general view of feminists, it will only continue to fade more  and more into being a supremacy movement, while egalitarism will more  and more take over the fight for true equality.

feminists  argument there actually shouldn't be because this will scare  away real victims then maybe we should also stop the laws against rape so real male victims of false accusations will be protected logic right ?

&#x200B;

**""Ya'll bouta get real mad at me for this one... Women have a higher and stronger immune system and recover from diseases/illness, etc. than men do. (1 point for women) Who is smarter? women, actually. (1 point for women) who has a larger muscle mass and is physically stronger? Men. (1 point for men) Who was given the fantasy that they're superior and now have an advantage over women because of it and caused us to now decide if genders are equal?  Men. (1 point) Total: Women (2 points) Men (2 points) They're Equal.**

**Now getting into who has it harder.  Period cramps and pains are equal to the pain of a heart attack and possibly giving birth. Women go through it every month for 5+ days and have the ability to completely cover up the pain in public areas. Men can't do that. Women are body shamed and told how they should look almost on a daily basis. They are pressured into doing things that they do not want to do. If they are assaulted or raped, they are told things like ""you probably enjoyed it"" or ""What were you wearing? You were asking for it"" If I go out into public confidently wearing a crop top and shorts, I am not doing it to be raped or pressured into sexual activities. I am doing it because I am confident in my body.  I understand that you can think what you want, but if you behave and act on a woman because you can't control your body, then you obviously you should not be out in public.**

**However, sadly there are women that use their advantage over men in an irresponsible way by accusing men of rape or assault, and then the woman is automatically believed. And by the time they are proven innocent, the damage is already done.**

**So, in my opinion and many others opinion, they are somewhat equal.""**

You all as well put that out there, so after reading your comments, a little Jordan Peterson, some Art of Manliness, and rereading the sub, I made a battle plan with rules for myself. 

The main rule was not to compromise my values while handling this, and to walk with dignity. I took on more work, interjecting myself into team work activities, and sending all the work I have done to my boss before my coworkers as to avoid sabotage or work theft. At the end of the day, when one of them tried to make a complaint, the bias was evident. My boss challenged them in it, and they backed down. Things seem to have dried up on the harrassment front since then, and though they don't like me, it's more motivation to defend and look out for myself.

IS ONE HEALTHY FATHER ENOUGH!? she has rich parents and their lawyer team has been giving me hell for the last year! While she destroys her life, the lawyers destroy mine and our son's!!

 My 3-year-old son has not seen his mother in 3 months! He had supervised visits with her, on and off, one day a week since her D.V. arrest in 2019. She was also arrested in April for possession and DUID. She has serious suicidal thoughts; she has had distant past and recent 5150/5250s.

She's been diagnosed with many mental health conditions, including bilolar, PTSD, borderline personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder,  Disassociative diso,rder and more.

 This August she possibly tried to poison him at a visit. The visitation monitor took them to the hospital and she tried to feed him the stuff again, and caused a been scene. She then got irate and violent with hospital staff and security in front of him. She had police and DCFS called on her.

 Just before our forced separation sep 2019 she told me she was having thoughts of harming him. I read, last month she told a detective that she had had thoughts of harming herself and our son; she also blamed the thoughts on witchcraft. She also has given different reasons for why she fed our son bathtub soap. My wifes biological mother was schizophrenic and I fear she may be, at 29, a late onset case.  

The Los Angeles courts are very slow during the covid-19 limitations, also her wealthy parents pay a lawyer team to complicate the process and miscronstrude facts, and block her medical records from being subpoenaed so far. It feels like the lawyers and the court do have our sons best interest as priority.

 After I filled a restraining order to protect him in aug, I offered her Zoom video visits last week, but she did not exept the conditions. 

 Our son does not seem to be effected by this at all, some times he asks for her. I wish he could see her, but I also don't want to risk his life. It's hard to know what her intention was in feeding him stuff that wasn't food 2 times in a row.

He is a very happy 3 year old, social and smart. I spend everyday with him when he's not at school, but I fear that not seeing his mother will traumatize him. It is really weighing on me to make the right decisions. Can you make suggestions on what to do? 
What do I tell him when he asks to see his mom? 
Can I see a psychologist to inform me on how to parent him and help me make visitation decisions?
And how likely is it that his mother was trying to harm him by what she did and if not, then why would she feed him bathtub fizz dye once and then try again in the hospital?",TRUE,11,0.87,4,,/r/MensRights/comments/k1kc56/mother_mental_health_issues_my_son_is_losing_her/,ClayDePerna

Could use a sanity check. If anyone’s got stuff they disagree on I’m open to hear it. Or any relevant statistics or perspectives on the I issue. 

The way I see it, I’m not willing to risk a person going to prison or having their career/education/life ruined based on a rape claim alone. That doesn’t mean I’d assume they’re lying, and I’d give my full emotional support and help in whatever ways I can if someone told me they were raped. But I’m not willing to take sides, let alone put full blame on an individual without more information.

Like with all serious accusations, especially ones with serious legal repercussions, I think the claims need to be individually evaluated. Not blanket assumed one way or the other.

Now I don’t think the “innocent until proven guilty” law is as straight forward here because I can imagine it’s difficult for many women to come forward. At the same time, forms of evidence do exist. Whether it be an actual rape kit or eyewitness accounts, there should be something to accompany the claim to take action over. The fact of the matter is that rape kits are often a choice, albeit a difficult one. I see that as better than no choice (as could be the situation for a person accused). I don’t feel that any fraction besides 100% of rape convictions being provably just would negate this.

I do want to touch on the handling of victims though. I feel like if someone claims they were raped they do deserve all the care and consideration of someone who was.

It’s the difference between grade results when gender bias is removed (for the most part).

“In contrast, ACT test scores are a point-in-time estimate of academic achievement. Because the ACT excludes items that might create a gender bias, it provides an objective, summative measure of student learning.”

In short, when boys are graded outside of the context of gender, and most likely when they study outside of the context of feminist teachers, they start to excel.

> “There is no society that can survive without strong men,” Owens, 31, wrote on Twitter in response to the photos of Styles, who, with the cover, became Vogue’s first solo male cover star. “The East knows this. In the west, the steady feminization of our men at the same time that Marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. It is an outright attack. Bring back manly men.”

This is a commonly-seen gynocentric pattern of attack.  She is basically saying that only men have an obligation to be strong, and that women are allowed to be as weak as they choose since it is entirely incumbent upon men to protect them, after all.

Also, when she says ""the East knows this"", I am not quite sure what she means since she does not really elaborate, but if she is trying to imply that crossdressing rock musicians do not exist in the East, I find that claim [difficult](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhOFg_3RV5Q) to substantiate.",TRUE,12,0.8,9,,/r/MensRights/comments/k1944t/candace_owens_uses_rock_musicians_wardrobe_as_red/,DignifiedAlpaca

26/11/2020 4:30,"Something is rotten in the men of Denmark? According to ""Violence against women - an EU-wide survey"" Danish men are the most violent, then come other countries that have been ranked the most equal by the EU. Hmm...","TLDR: the last couple of paragraphs try to say something about why ""more equal"" countries are ""more violent"". What are your thoughts?

The survey found that 31% of women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15. For Danish women the share was 52%. Other Nordic countries were not far behind: Finland 47% and Sweden 46%.  (p. 28) Fourth was the Netherlands - and thus we have the most equal countries (according to the EU) being the most violent against women!

I can't say I know exactly what's going on, so, here are just some observations I made while skimming through the ""Main Findings"" (see the link at the end).  

First, there are categories of violence that aren't necessarily violence at all. They include  pushing or shoving, slapping or grabbing, or pulling a woman’s hair. The most common form of violence is pushing (and shoving). It has happened to 74% of all victims (in the EU since the age of 15). I can't find any figure directly indicating how many women have only been pushed. That would be an interesting number when deciding whether the EU - or Denmark - is having a violence or pushing crisis. The report has this to say:

> Removing the most common experience of being ‘pushed’ or ‘shoved’ from the overall count of women’s experience of violence lowers the prevalence rate for violence only to 25 % [from 31%] in the past 12 months (see Table 2.6). This indicates that women experience a range of severe forms of violence in their lifetime.

I assume that instead of 12 months they are talking about ""since 15"" because 8% can't ""lower to 25%"" but 31% can. If so, this means that about 20% of those who have been pushed have only been pushed. How any of this would indicate that ""women experience a range of severe forms of violence in their lifetime"" is totally beyond me. Probably they're they just make things up. 

There seems to be no similar information about the other categories that aren't necessarily ""actual"" violence like ""grabbing"" or ""hard object thrown at them"". So, unfortunately, I have no idea how common is actual violence, the kind of violence we think when we think about violence. But we can say that it must be much lower than the 31% share activists - like the EU officials - use. Probably well below 20% even by their own criteria. 

Furthermore, it's not only men who push and grab women. Other women do it, too:

>  ...the majority of physical violence against women is also gender-based. However, one in four incidents (26 %) of non-partner physical violence is carried out by a female perpetrator...

Because the whole idea of the survey is to ""prove"" that violence against women by men is rampant this, too, weakens their feminist argument.  By the way, women like grab and pull hair more than men who, for their part, are more into pushing and shoving.

There is more to marvel in the methodology and the strange ""lapses"" but let's move on. The feminists who fabric ... wrote conducted the study must have found it frustrating that the countries they have ranked the most equal are the most violent. So, the report has an unusual self-reflection part - unusual for a feminist paper, that is. Had the violent countries been places like Romania or Bulgaria, which are ranked the least equal, that part would not have been necessary, I believe.

Here are the explanations that, how should I put it, are not too vague or stupid to be worth considering. In the more equal countries 

* people talk about private matters, such as VAW (violence against women) more openly (sounds reasonable but I don't know if it's true), 
* VAW is talked in media and women are encouraged to talk about it (certainly true),
* women go out more boldly, work in hazardous occupations etc (perhaps), 
* there is more violence in general (I don't think so) and 
* there is more binge drinking (true, I guess).

(See pp. 22- for ""Possible explanations for differences"" in the report.)

Anyway, I don't think they can really say anything meaningful because they are feminists and have decided beforehand what they want to say. And that is: violence is something men do a lot to women. Their whole worldview is based on this so that's what they'll say never mind what. 

But if you drop those premises, well, here's my take, for what it's worth. In addition to some of the sensible reasons above, in places like Denmark men and women are equal in the sense that men often treat women the same way they treat other men. Women don't get the same ""safety privileges"" they get in ""less equal"" countries. Women get pushed and shoved. Likewise, women can express their anger the same way. But when men -  and women - push or grab women - or men - it's not typically violence at all, contrary to what the men-hating faction wants to believe. 

Then there is jealousy. Perhaps in more ""equal"" countries the possibility of cheating increases. Perhaps people more often have disagreements on who should be with whom tonight. People spend, after all, time in places where both sexes are present and sexual mores are lax. 

By the way, I'm not from Denmark but Finland, ""the second most dangerous place for women in Europe"" as the local feminists, media, politicians etc want to remind us.

26/11/2020 1:47,disturbing slogan in feminism,"Have any of you guys encountered the slogan ""k1ll all men"" from feminists?  I've seen it from time to time and I find it disturbing to say the least.  To be fair, I can say I saw some feminists arguing against its use, but others seem perfectly okay with it.  Supposedly, it's some kind of joke, but I don't find it very funny.  It makes me wonder if I'll end up having to defend my life against a deranged woman who thinks assaulting or even murdering a man is somehow patriotic. Sounds like terrorism to me.  Some women do murder men.  Jodi Arias got her ex boyfriend all naked and vulnerable in the shower and then stabbed him to death.  

When someone makes some kind of violent statement and acts like it's just a funny joke, that's something to take seriously, IMO.  RooshV made his absurd statement about making rape legal as long as it's on private property.  When people were outraged, he backtracked, claiming it was just satire.  I know what's funny, and that wasn't funny.  Neither is the ""k1ll all men"" thing.  I had hoped for universal condemnation of that slogan by feminists, but that does not appear to be the case.  Some of them appear to think that's funny.  That gives me great concern that I'll end up being forced to defend my life against a deranged sicko.

It's much easier and much less stressful to stay home and do chores than it is to work a job.","So I took today off from work.  I wasn't planning on doing anything in particular but what I ended up doing was cleaning the house.  Top to bottom with chemicals - bleach, floor shine, windex, counter cleaner...  There's not an inch of this house that I didn't touch.  

I also cooked.  All three meals for me, my girlfriend (who works from home), and our kids.

And you know what I realized?

I would do the same thing every single day of my life if it meant I'd never have to work again. No more commuting.  No more worrying about money, fighting for promotions, stressing about layoffs, or having to kiss ass every day.

Now I'm not saying it was easy.  In fact I think I'm about as tired as I would be coming home from work.  But I'm strangely energized if that makes sense.  I just feel better.  (Plus, for the sake of argument, you don't have to do cleaning like that every day).

Anyway my point is that men definitely get the short end of the stick with this work vs cleaning stuff.  It's completely unfair. Not just because women get the better end of the deal. But also because society won't admit to this and instead looks down on men and the work we typically do for the family.

If women don't want to do housework then that's fine.  Get a job.  A real job that requires real work and pays enough to cover the bills and not just your spending money.  And then leave me home.  I'll make that sacrifice.  I'll take a bullet for the team.  And you'd better be appreciative of me even if I don't appreciate you going to work and paying the bills.  And when you get home, I get to boss you around and make you do whatever housework I decided I didn't want to do that day.  Not to mention the yard work, running errands on the way home, fixing things, and everything else that doesn't entail ""cooking and cleaning"".

Because that's the world that men live in.  And it sucks.  It's not a privilege to leave your house and work all day only to get nagged and hassled when you get home.  It's not a privilege to bust your butt every single day but have all of that ignored because your wife or girlfriend cleaned that day and is ""tired"".

Granted me and my girlfriend both work and we both regularly split chores.  Not a whole lot of people live in traditionalist households anymore.  But a lot of couples tend to split their responsibilities in that direction. With men working more (or at harder jobs) and women cleaning more.  

I'd definitely do it though. So long as I was the one who got to stay home.",TRUE,93,0.9,27,,/r/MensRights/comments/k0hklx/men_get_the_short_end_of_the_stick_with_this_work/,Oncefa2

To  some extent, I think norms in the past have not supported women's  achievement and advocacy for equality had merit. However, I don't see  feminism stopping at equality. It seems to me they are pushing men down  as they raise women up and, to me, it looks like a push for power and  domination, not equality.

In terms  of what creates power, there are a lot of different theories, but in  general I'd argue money is important. Weber's theory suggests its [closely related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-component_theory_of_stratification)  to influence and it makes sense logically. It can buy you exposure,  help recruit talented people and influence what actions people choose to  take. Couple that with the fact that people [support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism) others in their in-group and money becomes a tool of social influence to support groups those who earn it are part of.

Whether people choose to earn money often comes down to norms. They're extremely powerful at directing action, and [Stanford](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/social-norms/)  says they're a viable alternative to written laws. Women already have  norms in favor of working and achievement through feminism. Men's norms  still seem to be up in the air.

See the umpteen million past threads on the topic if you actually want to know what we think and not just tell us what you think (because this is AskFeminists, not RantAtFeminists). Post is removed.""

and was immediately banned. I don't get it, do feminist not care about male victims of false accusations, or do you think there is something wrong with the way I've asked this?

----

**I was just watching a video on YouTube about a man that spent a full year in prison, and lost his job and all scholarships because of a false rape accusation. The woman was charged and only spent roughly 35 days in country jail with a fine.**

**My question to you, is how is this fair? I've often heard the sentiment that making punishments for false rape accusations more harsh will dissuade real rape victims from coming forward, but shouldn't you be telling this to people that make up the false rape accusations in the first place rather than the men that were victimized from them? If anything were to make it harder for victims to come forward, that would be the fault of people who make up these accusations and I don't see why the victim of the accusation should not see their justice because of that.**

**Also, I'm not even advocating that rape and false rape crimes get the same sentence, they are obviously two different crimes. But it is asinine to me that people pretend that it is simply ""a false police report"" and should be treated as such, considering that a rapist is pretty much the most vile thing you can be in our society - therefore such an accusation will *destroy* you way more than any other kind of false accusation.**

**I guess it just bothers me that some people think that a slap on the wrist is an adequate punishment for lying about a type of crime that can land you in prison for the rest of your life and essentially destroy your livelihood to an extent that you can never recover from even if it was proven a lie, yet these same people are willing to criticize how the police handle rape victims and rape kits.**

**Both obviously need to be treated seriously - like a crime that violates a person's being and should be treated accordingly.**

-----

**I'm not here for an argument, it just makes zero sense to me, so I am asking. Hopefully none of the language used is offensive.**

25/11/2020 2:35,Just watched the Suspiria remake (2018) and was so disappointed by one scene depicting male sexual abuse and humiliation. What a wasted chance.,"Just finished watching the film and almost thought it was really good except for one scene that really ruined it for me.
(Slight spoiler ahead)

There is a scene where 2 police men come to investigate. They are only shown very briefly in the film and these are the only 2 men depicted throughout. It then cuts and we see that the men have been hypnotized and the witches have taken down one of their pants and is holding his penis whilst they all howl with laughter prodding his genitals with hooks and weapons.

Without that scene this could have been a perfect example of how a film could be made with an all female cast and how women don't need to rely on male humiliation to be 'strong' and 'empowered'. It was a nasty and depraved scene that I can only think was there to appease the desperate minds of certain extreme feminists who believe that emasculation and humiliation is the only to getting ahead in society. The fact that it is barely spoken about in the Google searches I have done shows that it is probably considered to be a harmless element or, more worryingly, a positive aspect of the film. If it were the other way round, a group of men stripping a women naked and prodding her genitals and body whilst laughing uncontrollably, there would (quite rightly) be an outcry stating the film promoted and excused sexual assault and humiliation. I am happy to be proven wrong but I cannot think of a single film where women are sexually assaulted and it is presented as a positive, humorous and empowering thing.

This might seem like a relatively trivial matter to some but I am seeing it constantly in media. From kicks in the groin, male nudity, sexual and non-sexual violence for the sake of positivity or humour, castration both actual and verbally spoken and laughed about etc it is abundant. The casual and explicit sexual exploitation of men and the emasculation of them for the supposed benefit of female supremacy and empowerment is shocking and I can't believe that there aren't hoards of sane and moral people out there arguing against it. It truly is having a hugely detrimental effect on my mental health and it is making me hugely suspicious and untrusting of women which I know is essentially my own issue but the fact I am becoming a product of the media and social world around me concerns me that others are too, both male and female. I hope that the majority of people would see how wrong this would be but I worry the further we go down this route of media presenting aggression and humiliation, especially sexual, towards men as a positive thing the more society, and especially our children, will grow to think this is acceptable and positive. 

What a wasted opportunity to show that a film can be made purely with women that doesn't need to rely on the degradation of men to bring female presence and empowerment to the mainstream.",TRUE,7,0.89,2,,/r/MensRights/comments/k0asc7/just_watched_the_suspiria_remake_2018_and_was_so/,notsogreatpretender

25/11/2020 0:14,What to Do When You May Be a Victim of DV,"#Introduction
Domestic Violence (DV) is commonly assumed to have a single perpetrator and a single victim; thanks to the misogynistic Duluth model, *men* have faced injustices in this area for decades. This is despite hard evidence that women are *more likely than men* to be physically *AND* emotionally coercive in single-perpetrator relationships where DV occurs. Men face difficult challenges in getting support, whether it is from DV shelters, friends, family, or even law enforcement.

These injustices are not going to be remedied any time soon.

So that means we must find ways to mitigate our risks, because we are *guilty until proven innocent* in this area of the law. We must be educated on matters pertaining to DV so we can proactively avoid relationships that present a DV risk, we must know what our tools are and have a plan in order to survive and not get destroyed by the system.

#Part 1- Knowledge and Networking
There is no substitute for knowing your local laws, the social and cultural standards of your area pertaining to DV, and the severity with which perpetrators are handled. Many resources are generally available, and they should inform your plans, as the severity of the risk is greatly influenced by these conditions.

""Rub elbows"" with people on law enforcement, become acquaintances with a variety of professionals, doctors, lawyers, security specialists, financial experts. Get to know them, get to know their positions on DV and men's rights- so you can know who to trust. Because if the shit hits the fan, you'll need help, and they can help you if you've been good to them.

You will also need to learn a few surveillance and electronic skills, to install audio and video surveillance, as well as critical thinking and planning skills required to give yourself a safety net.

#Part 2- The Safety Net
You will need a few things in order to be able to take action in the event of DV.
1. Cash and Identification
2. Transportation
3. Communications
4. Basic necessities for at least three days
5. Shelter
6. Evidence

These things are non-negotiable. How you obtain each one will vary, and the degree to which you perform will be essential. Many abusers constrain their victims in many ways, limiting contact, limiting finances, preventing access to a vehicle, and more. This pattern creates a form of traumatic passivity, where one normalizes the abuse and develops a *""trauma bond,""* where the victim accepts abuse in exchange for positive experience. If you are making an *excuse* for your abuser, you need help desperately because, chances are, *you will be unable to make effective and healthy choices pertaining to your abuser and will be unable to successfully escape until you are irrevocably harmed.""*

Cash and ID- You need a safe-deposit box with negotiable items like Traveler's Cheques, Prepaid Visa/MasterCard/Other gift cards, some cash, and ideally a form of identification like a passport. You will need a safe place to hide additional identification so you can obtain these things at the bank. (Yes that's *three* (3) forms of *PRIMARY* identification (ask your financial expert what that is if you need help).) Without these things, you may be unable to successfully escape. A credit card in your name with no paper billing might be good to stash in your safe box.

Transportation- You need access to *ANY* form of transportation, vehicle or bicycle, and the means to secure it. If that's leaving a bike at a neighbor's house down the street, chained in their side yard, leaving a copy of car keys somewhere only you know,  etc. You need to be able to evacuate.

Communications- Abusers love to prevent communication about their actions with the outside. You will need a prepaid phone in the event your abuser destroys your phone. A hidden pre-paid phone card and knowledge of the nearest pay-phone (rare these days) can work. You will also need a P.O. Box (or it's equivalent) so you can get mail securely. Save the spare key in your Safe Deposit box.

Basic Necessities- Toiletries, Medication, Work Clothes, socks/underwear. Keep this bag prepped and ready. You'll need at least two sets of clothing, three pairs of under garments, and medication for at least two weeks. This ensures you can continue to work, even if you have to do laundry at a laundromat every other day.

Shelter- Any cheap motel will do for the first night. After that, you need to find an apartment or AirB'n'B that can suit your needs *inexpensively*. Look around and find places beforehand. Knowledge is everything.

Evidence- This is the hardest. Record *everything* on your phone, and store it in the cloud. Ensure your phone is password-protected, and never share it. Ever. EVER DO YOU HEAR? Document the events that occur with your trusted physician, therapist (if you have one), a psychiatrist (if you have one), write down everything she said or did to you, and sign and date it immediately, and mail it to your P.O. Box. Do not hesitate, but it will stay safe there, and the time stamp on the envelope will prove when it was sent. You can also (SECRETLY) set up surveillance in your home to record all incidents of abuse.

If you are currently in an abusive situation, do everything within your power to obtain the following: A safe-deposit box, a P.O. Box, cash and basic necessities, an additional ID, and a prepaid phone. A cheap (but functional) bicycle on Craigslist can help.

#Part 3 - Leaving
First Hours- Gather *EVERYTHING* you need and leave immediately. You will be afraid, but you have everything you need. If you have your phone, factory reset the device, and contact everyone that needs contacting. If you have a vehicle, drive to the P.O. Box and get your records, and then to the Bank and store the evidence there. Get your negotiables, ID if you need it, and anything else. Go to the store and obtain your basic necessities. Check in to a Motel and start formulating your long-term plan. Change ALL of your passwords **immediately.**

Do not contact *ANY* of her friends, her family members, where she works, nothing.

First Day- Take the day off if you can.  get your documentation and evidence, and head down to the courthouse and file a restraining order *immediately*. Do not hesitate. If you need assistance, contact an Attorney that specializes in DV, and preferably is one you are familiar with. You may consider doing this ahead of time if you have consistent, uncontestable proof of her wrongdoing in order to build an MO. You can even make the report at a police substation in order to build what you need. (Keep in mind, she will need to be served in order for the restraining order to be enforceable.)

Go to your bank, if you have a joint bank account with your abuser, withdraw everything in it and close the account. Go to a different bank, and open a new bank account. Ensure the address for mail is sent to your P.O. Box. Keep some cash on hand until you receive the debit card and/or checks in your P.O. Box. Transfer your direct deposit (if you have one) to your new bank account. The earlier this is done, the better.

Get a new phone number and new device if you need it.

First Week- Secure a means transportation. Consult with your attorney about your next steps.

Consideration-Children: Take them with you at first. You will need additional funding and planning to accommodate them, but leaving them in the hands of your abuser will inevitably result in parental alienation. Discuss with your attorney if they have been abused, or whether you should contact social services. Pack everything you need for them, so they can continue their schooling and be taken care of. PLAN PLAN PLAN. You may consider contacting the authorities and file a report about the abuse and the abuse of your children. Understand what the ramifications of that are.

Consideration-Married: Not much different, except you should fill out the divorce documents as you want them (consult your attorney if necessary) and make copies. Have your attorney deliver them. If you have kids it gets complicated, and fast.

#Conclusion
You know what your risks and fears are better than anyone else. Take the steps you need in order to secure your basic needs, and then execute upon it without mercy. The world is vicious and treats men mercilessly, so you must plan and act as if you were alone. Take time to ensure your plan is well thought out.

Pay attention to red-flags that indicate abusive behavior:

Extreme jealousy: Accusations of cheating, asking for passwords to your phone or Email, anger at normal conversations with other women, threatens to leave if you don't stop talking to your friends, etc.

Emotional manipulation: attempts at making you feel guilty for not doing what she wants, gaslighting, threats, however subtle, etc.

Financial coercion: Requests to deposit your checks into her account, anger at not paying for things she wants, dismisses gifts because they ""weren't good enough,"" fraudulent activity on your accounts initiated by her, etc.

Physical violence of any kind (non-consenting): slapping, punching, kicking, especially if made in anger.

Sexual violence of any kind: Damage to genitalia, use of sex to coerce behavior, sexual assault or rape.

Feminism: the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes.

Radical: advocating or based on thorough or complete political or social change; representing or supporting an extreme or progressive section of a political party.

23/11/2020 22:13,I wish I was not circumcised,"As the title says. Like many men, I was cut as a baby. Nobody told me about it, so I found out by accident when I started watching porn later in my teens. I had heard a bit about the procedure prior, but without knowing what a foreskin actually was, I wasn't actually sure about my circumcision status until I saw an actual foreskin. Without knowing anything about what a foreskin did, I felt disgusted, violated, and angry. As I did more research, I felt very sad I will never be able to experience sex as an intact man, that I would have sensations and function missing for the entirety of my life. There are a lot of emotions to unpack, but there is envy, anger, depression, despair, dysphoria, and a profound sense of loss among other negative emotions I feel on a semi regular basis.

I talked to my parents about it, and I cannot be angry at them. Hell, my dad was cut and both my parents agreed to the procedure because it was supposed to be beneficial. The doctors words were apparently ""I would do it to my son"". We cut most boys when they are born so it feels like having a problem with being cut is going against our culture. Many people will not listen to you if you complain about it, as if one should be happy they had a piece of their genitals cut off and destroyed. It is very disheartening. Combined with the fact that the procedure is irreversible, I feel disgusting.

Personally, I was cut very tight. I had to be very delicate down there else I get a tear. Abrasions were also very common. On top of this, I am fairly numb in the whole area, so I feel nothing from many sexual acts. I was surprised the first time I had oral as I was totally underwhelmed. Sex feels ok, but is not stellar, and I have the stereotypical problem of needing to jackhammer to get off. I have also discovered that lube is necessary for me to have sex as I have had painful experiences for myself and my partners because of chafing; an intact penis actually contributes to lubrication during sex (and masturbation). I masturbated much later than my peers because nothing felt very good when I touched my penis; I just had an awkward, frustrating boner I couldn't do anything with. When I finally figured it out, I routinely tore my skin and gave myself abrasions unless I used lube. I learned later this was not normal.

I know society is slowly changing it's view on the procedure, but I feel left by the wayside. This is something that really is not taken seriously by our culture at large; in fact, it's a joke to many. Even if it was taken seriously, it is too late for myself and many others. It hurts. Many people will probably accuse me of finding a weird hill to die on. To be fair, there is more to life than just sex, but it feels very unfair to be mutilated then expected to be even grateful for it when much of the world is able to live in their intact bodies.",TRUE,303,0.93,174,,/r/MensRights/comments/jziawe/i_wish_i_was_not_circumcised/,Shoemethemonkey

24/11/2020 1:37,Diversity: What a great concept in theory.,"So, sure, diversity seems like a great concept on paper, but is it really OR is it just an excuse to discriminate against the 'right' people and get away with it.

A couple of weeks ago I went on a job interview. There were 107 applicants and they had gotten it down to 3 people to interview. The first part of the interview was all of us together and we were given what amounted to a small test, 25 tech questions about windows 10, Server 2016 and Office 365. 

I aced the exam, got all questions right and because of that, I got to go on to the next phase. The person with the lowest score was supposed to be OUT but this is 2020 and well, that person was a woman. As we handed in our exams, they gave each person their mark and we waited in the outside office to hear who was out. We knew who it was going to be because we exchanged marks and she only had 5 questions correct because she had no server experience or any admin experience on Win 10. 

The HR lady comes out and looks at the other guy and says ""Sorry but you were the lowest score and unfortunately, we have to let you go"". He responds that ""we know all the scores and I wasn't the lowest so like WTF"".  He asks him to leave or she is going to call security. He leaves.

The next phase in the one on one interview and mine went very well, They had a serious of questions on paper, some tech and some were just ""What would you do in this scenario"".

The woman who was up for the job was very nice, while waiting for the one on one interviews to start, she said, ""Well that was bizarre, He had a much higher score than me"". I told her, You are getting his job because they want a woman for this job. 

She asks me WHY???, I said ""This org has 42 total employees and if they hire me, it will only be the second guy working her"". ""Do you really think they aren't going to hire another woman""?

Lo and Behold I didn't get the job. 

As part of the 'debrief,' I asked if there was anything I could do to improve my chances in the future of getting a job like this. The response was that ""Sorry there is nothing we can add, you were a strong candidate but in the end, it came down to the final score on all phases of the process"". 

My response ""Well, I must have really blown the interview since I have 25+ years of experience with all aspects of IT management which the other candidate had only 3 or 4, I have a college diploma with several certifications and the other candidate does not have any certs. 

I talked to the other candidate today as it was her first day on the job (we exchanged phone numbers during the process because she was worried she was only being hired because she was a woman) and she asked her boss how she got this job with so little experience and the other candidate had way more experience and she was told: ""We are trying in our organization to put a woman front and center in all aspects"".

In Singapore, men have a forced military service of 2 years. Women don't.  Mrs Singam is a ""gender equality"" advocate in Singapore who have connection with the government.

""Over the years, several gender equality advocates have called for NS to be redefined and for the Government to allow both men and women to serve — in a reimagined NS.Instead of just viewing it as military service, Mrs Singam said all acts of service to society can be part of NS.""

What it means is that they will make any non-dangerous, non combat, non physically and mentally diffucult things as a part of NS (military service). So that they will claim that women give as much as men for their country.... It will be done in the name of feminism and probably used as a proof that feminism fight for men and equality, while they almost didn't do anything about the issue. The only thing will be that women will  also loose freedom. But men's human right is still not respected.

""Ms Rayna Kway reiterated that the way men talk about gender inequality needs to be examined.“They are like ‘Oh we serve NS and you don’t. So it means we can get away with certain things and get some privileges.’ It’s also an inherent problem, in which society is set up where we are in this ‘us’ versus ‘them’ situation,” she said.""

As always feminists cannot make the difference between earned rights and privileges ? Men are compensated because they make a sacrifice for the country that women don't. Take away the price that men pay for these privilieges if you want to give them to women or make women pay for it too.

23/11/2020 11:15,"The toxicity and misandry of online feminist groups and subs and how feminism has gone from being about equality to something so much more ugly (long, but a must read)","So, this is something I've wanted to get off my chest for a few days now as I feel it's really important and needs to be said. It's about the absolute toxic misandry I have witnessed on feminism subs on reddit and in other places. It is a message to all of those who are still under the illusion that much of feminism these days isn't sadly filled with this quite severe misandry and who still believe that it is instead about the equality that it purports to be.

Here goes.

Recently, I came across a thread on the TrueOffMyChest sub which was posted by a female user saying she had been banned from [t](https://www.reddit.com/r/Feminism/)he Feminism sub for saying something the moderators didn't like. They refused to give her a reason but she then went on to talk about how being a member there means you must talk about men like they're rapists and must have an attitude of wanting men to genuinely hate themselves for who they are.

Well, this struck a chord because I had my own experience of posting there and I'll share it as my first example.

There was a thread there not so long ago which said that any men who say they have any worries of false accusations are rapists themselves. Here's something about me...I once got falsely accused. Not of anything particularly serious, but it was a false accusation in my workplace by a woman (actually a group of women), who decided they didn't like me and wanted to try and bring me down a peg. They reported me to my manager (also female), saying that I'd supposedly been making them feel uncomfortable, been showing them too much interest etc. Now 1) these women weren't of any interest to me 2) I was too busy, and too stressed, with doing my high pressure job to care about them (I didn't even know what some looked like, that's how little interest I paid) and 3) I later found out that they had done this before to other guys. Nevertheless, my manager 'had to take their accusation seriously' and it affected my employment because suddenly these people were talking about me negatively and I was on a temporary contract with very few solid rights. No evidence produced of course...it didn't exist..but when my manager went off sick with stress my contract unfortunately also came to an end. People had made their mind up about me. It was extremely stressful, upsetting and left me unemployed for quite some time.

So, on this feminism thread I mentioned this and basically said ""hang on...false accusations do sometimes happen (relaying my story), so I understand why some men say they have worries about it...we're not all rapists because we have those worries"". Wow...the abuse I got was just unbelievable. I was downvoted maybe about 50 times for that post and any subsequent ones and one of the top voted replies (ironically), was a woman calling me (and I quote), 'an absolute piece of sh\*t'. I asked them why is was apparently ok for me to give me actual verbal abuse merely for telling my story and correcting the quite extreme nature of the original post but they doubled down on the abuse and the pile on continued. As I tried to defend myself I continued to be downvoted and was then permanently banned by the moderators. I note that the most vicious posters were defended by moderators even when I reported their posts. I believe one particularly bad post was deleted but the rest were allowed to remain. The user who came out with the 'you're an absolute piece of sh\*t"" was certainly protected by the moderators and remains as a user.

So anyway, it really was a case of 'agree with our man hating or you are a 'piece of sh\*t'.

[https://ibb.co/X2w5QN3](https://ibb.co/X2w5QN3)

Funnily enough, one member of that sub messaged me later to ask if I was ok. Her words; 'reddit pile ons are the worst'...'I hate that this sub is like that...there's too many man haters, I'm going off it'. That's coming from one of the rare decent feminists on there (I repeat, abusive comments to me were upvoted 20-30+ times so I am not exaggerating here).

So what's going on? Why is reddit allowing its feminism subs to become a place of hate, something which is being allowed by their moderators?

I'll move on to my second example. Personally I think it gets worse.

On the original thread I mentioned here by the woman who got banned from the Feminist sub, there were references to another feminist sub which was apparently very toxic. This one called FemaleDatingStrategy. So I thought I'd take a look. Oh. My. Goodness. This is man hating (extreme sexism for anyone who needs reminding) on another level.

Take the following thread as an example. You know how feminists like to portray the idea that men are bad, superficial, nasty etc and women are good (examples of this narrative exist all throughout that sub by the way)? Well just take a look at screenshots of these replies:

[https://ibb.co/gRRN3Z3](https://ibb.co/gRRN3Z3)[https://ibb.co/q1wsV3k](https://ibb.co/q1wsV3k)[https://ibb.co/sRJ4dVQ](https://ibb.co/sRJ4dVQ)[https://ibb.co/bRm3XT3](https://ibb.co/bRm3XT3)

It is about some lady who proposed to her boyfriend with a watch and was seemingly happy enough to post her good news online. Well these 'kind' feminists took that post and not only tore into her for proposing, but decided to tear into the appearance of her now fiance who probably has no idea that he is being ripped to shreds all over the internet. I'll quote some of the lovely comments and who wrote them for good measure:

""Jesus Christ. The election dominated the news cycle so much I never got the memo about a dick shortage"" (upvoted 145 times...yes, that's one hundred and forty five times).

""Girl..... THIS is what you lost your self respect for? "" (105 upvotes).

""Guys this girl is obviously a queen if she can marry a man with a forehead big enough to land her helicopter on"" (upvoted 70 times)

""Just like his hairline her self respect is none existent "" by (upvoted 47 times)

""This guy's shoulders... he couldn't protect her from a 14 year old boy. 😒"" by (upvoted 64 times)

""Sorry, but if he looks like this and hasn't proposed to you yet, then you aren't the one, sis."" by (upvoted 7 times)

That was just a sample. Simply put, toxic, unbelievably nasty and blatant misandrist bullying. These people are literally online bullies and there's no other word for it. There are of course other 'eww' comments but those were just a selection.

You know, you can see just from this example how total the man hating is. This isn't just a small % of users...this is literally hundreds of people upvoting and joining in the bullying, just like I had experienced in my first example. I don't want to make this too long, but anyone is free to see other common examples in this sub.

Now, one thing that hit home with me in this particular thread were the bullying comments about the guys hair loss. This is because, when I was a bit younger I had severe OCD and body dysmorphia and in particular I had it about the fact that my hair had started thinning. Frankly, I was very unwell and it almost killed me. I used to spend a lot of time on 'support forums' for this and so often there were stories of men there who were either suicidal or even from family members of men who had taken their own lives over the issue. I remember distinctly, about ten years ago, a thread on a website called hairlosshelp (it no longer exists - I checked tonight because I wanted to find the thread). It was from the sister of a man who had just taken his own life over his hair loss and the bullying comments he had received from people, including women, about it. He had left a note asking her to thank them for their support while he was alive. You never forget reading things like that. Other similar examples exist on these forums right now.

Having seen those comments I thought, hey, I'll do a search of the FemaleDatingStrategy sub for the term 'bald' and see what else comes up. Well...here's another where you can see the hate for yourself:

This time a thread about coronavirus supposedly killing men who are bald at a higher rate. It has been posted with the flair 'scrotes mad' (scrotes is the derogatory term they frequently use to refer to men there - they actually have a official term for their manhating which they use in flairs!).

Here are a couple of the replies:

[https://ibb.co/yPXG9xh](https://ibb.co/yPXG9xh)[https://ibb.co/kDqyDcS](https://ibb.co/kDqyDcS)

One of the main replies (upvoted 45 times) says: "" Nature’s trying to fix her mistakes by whipping out those bald genes for us. 😂👌🏻 "".

Now, just a reminder...these 45+ women are laughing about men who have literally died from coronavirus. Men who are also people's fathers, brothers, sons etc. Someone please tell me where else that level of hate goes casually unchallenged? Try telling me these feminist subs are not absolutely full of the very worst kind of toxic man haters.

The creator of the thread then replies to this comment with ""I just had some ignorant scrote send me a dm telling me that all women are scum because I created this post about lessening the gene pool and finding it funny. I was like, block, block, I am sure, yes, block."" So...not only is this delightful man-hating bully posting this stuff in the first place, she is boasting about how she blocked anyone who called her scum for it and is trying to spin it as 'he said all women are scum' for apparent support. Again, totally unchallenged by the toxic moderators.

Look, I could just go on and on giving really toxic, misandrist examples from both the Feminism and FemaleDatingStrategy subs but I'd be here all day. I was just made aware of the level of toxicity by others and thought I'd check it out myself and was still shocked by just how bad it is.

Now I want to ask 1) why is this level of sexism and hate allowed to go on? Surely reddit must clamp down on these two subs in particular, and specifically on the moderators who have both encouraged and allowed this culture of hate.

and 2) to those reading, do you still feel that there isn't a massive, massive issue within feminism of misandry and what is actually a push for female superiority over equality? Like, these women are quite literally laughing at men who have died who didn't live up to their standards. They're commenting and upvoting in their hundreds on these posts and similar. That's how sick it is. They are dishing out verbal abuse like 'you're a piece of sh\*t' (as I experienced) for explaining a situation which had been very distressing (not to mention career impacting) for me, and they are openly bullying people's appearances. Not in small numbers. Overwhelmingly.

One of the things that has struck me about feminism in recent years is this quickness to downplay any men's issues. Take the stats of men taking their own lives at 3-4 times the rate of women. These feminists will say 'yeah well men just need to learn to talk more, this is why we need more feminism'. They will literally spin something so serious as the need for more feminism. They won't look at their own hate, they won't consider the very real issues that men face on a daily basis (the stats of which are all over men's right forums...about homelessness, custody, being left ostracized and left lonely (one of the biggest causes of male suicide) etc etc....nope...they will simply say things like 'this is why we need more feminism so those men don't have to suffer their toxic masculinity'. Quite frankly, they don't give a sh\*t. And is that really surprising given everything I've detailed in this thread? I want men reading this to not fall into the trap of pandering to some of these feminists. Yes, there is a place for feminism, particularly in the third world where many women really do get a rough time of things, but a huge part of feminism has become 'equality and beyond', double standards and male hate galore.

I will just start to draw to a close here because this has been really long. But unfortunately it did need to be quite long.

One last point major point...there is a real drive by feminists even in mainstream media to downplay any issues faced by men. I've seen it at the BBC in particular for some time where they have on a regular basis created articles bashing men, ignoring the issues that men face every day, yet perpetuating the narrative of 'men bad, women good'.

I noticed it last year when they effectively tried their best to make it illegal for men to talk to or chat up women in public. Now sure, no doubt a number of men will have been absolute d\*cks and not taken no for an answer or been offended by rejection, but these feminists discussing those BBC articles tried to shame ANY man who wanted to try to meet any woman in real life while out and about. I firmly believe that this falls under the category like above of 'don't you undeserving scrotes think you can try it with me, stay in your lane on tinder where i can have my convenient pick of the bunch and ignore you if i don't like you'. It's sad, but I know full well there is a lot of truth to it. It's at least partially about getting an upper hand. The BBC created more than a couple of articles about this topic and it's just another indicator of the level that feminism has gone to.

I will actually end very soon. A couple of days ago, I realised it was 'International Men's Day'. I thought, hey, I'll go on the BBC website and check what they've done for it. There was nothing from them besides a quick mention on a sport article. Instead I found on their main pages an outright sexist article titled ""Have female CEO's coped better with Covid than men?"". No evidence, nothing to back that question up, just casual discussion and sexism. Can you even imagine the up-raw if it had said 'have male CEO's coped better with covid than women""? They would never even consider running that story. What if you swapped the male for 'white' and 'female for 'black'. Again, hell no (obviously). It's just outright casual sexism and misandry (on international men's day of all days) by an increasingly feminist BBC. Even on international men's day, it was a day to bash men. To ignore all the issues they face in the world and to tell them how sh\*t they are.

To any women who read my post today, I hope you absolutely condemn this type of 'feminism' and see just how toxic much of it has become. I hope you see why kindness is so important and why bullying of any sort is wrong. To the men reading, I hope you've picked up a few (perhaps uncomfortable) truths from this. Yes, sadly there is a growing movement which quite literally has hate for you unless you pander to every single thing they say, and if you don't look how they want you to look or act how they want you to act they will hate you too. So just don't pander to it, be strong, and realise that THEY are the problem and that their feminism is largely a discriminatory agenda. Know that many of these people operate by using shaming tactics to gain a sense of power, presumably to satisfy their own hate. Honestly, it is sad. These people have issues. I wouldn't mind betting that deep down some of them are ashamed of some of their words and actions but for whatever reason they have these anger issues and men are their target. I actually hope that they change, for their own benefit too.

TL;DR.... Really, it needs to be read. Take five minutes out of your day and read it. But basically what I'm saying (with examples), is that there is a real toxicity within online feminist groups and a huge amount of misandry. It has permeated into the media and into men's lives, sometimes with dire consequences. It cannot be allowed to continue and men (and the kinder women of society) need to actually come together against this too.

Note...i do expect more than a few downvotes for this thread, probably from members of these feminist groups, but I'm not at all worried about that. The important part was that I got this message out. This sort of hate in the form of misandry has to be called out. At the moment it's just being allowed a free pass under the flag of 'feminism'.

Update:

Funnily enough, just after writing this, a member of parliament had his appearance attacked related to things I have just mentioned. Many of those attacks came from 'feminists' on twitter. This was his response.

Last week, following a verbal disagreement with a staff member, a black man was escorted out of a Carrefour supermarket in the city of Porto Alegre by two security guards and brutally and cowardly beaten to death.

Reports of what started the fight differ, so nobody does in fact know for sure what happened inside of that supermarket; we don't know if the man was in fact causing troubles, but even if he was, what is indisputable is that in a civil society literally nobody deserves being tried on the spot and condemned to death (translate: assassinated) for a minor infraction.

What followed was predictable: violent protests erupted across the country, as the man was compared to George Floyd.

This whole movement isn’t “uh, who cares if a woman was raped? I was too, so move aside!”, it’s saying “hey, that sucks. Sorry to hear that. I know what you’re going through. Unfortunately I wasn’t as lucky as nowhere as many resources were available to me. That needs to change”. It’s not taking the fire out of female empowerment, it’s trying to add fuel to bust these issues for all parties. 

I asked my brother about what he thought google not having an international men’s day doodle, and he said “ah, the whole day is pointless because men didn’t have issues to bring to the table”. I then brought up the issues that indeed WERE trying to be brought to light, and he said “ah well I didn’t see those. Half of those aren’t correct anyways”.

Bring me your controversial subject material!” And I thought “cool.

I gave my reasons (which I’m sure you all know off by heart by now) and then the opposition spoke up, gave their points with no evidence, and it was declared they won. 

I brought up these issues many times to many teachers, and they’ve never really given their stance (besides my humanities teacher). With the default mindset being feminists are right, this war will never be won. This counterintuitive loop will most likely never be broken. I once had a mental breakdown about this. It’s not fun, fingers al tingly, heavy breathing, lots of crying and even more shouting. Please guys, I really need some encouraging words, but even more some hope.

23/11/2020 15:01,I Have Issues with Women,"It's pretty simple, as the title suggests. I have issues with women stemming from deep-rooted trauma arising from awful experiences with awful female authority figures; including my mother, teachers, lecturers and supervisors. 

This has made me guilty of the very things I have bashed feminists of for years and years. Only seeing the negative side of women and ignoring the great parts of women. I am guilty of ignoring the shitty parts of men to back-up this idea and not calling men out on their bullshit. I am starting to see both sides. 

Truth be told, I have used subs like this to enable this view and I'm not saying this sub is at fault, I'm simply admitting that I'm at fault here. 

Why does this relate to any of you? On a personal level, it's an admission of wrongdoing for me. But on a wider scale, it is a lesson we can all take from this. We can all be guilty of using social or political issues to mask our pain and areas we need to work on. Nobody is perfect, and I'm not taking shots at anyone, we're all doing our best. 

I still believe that we have huge inequality on both sides, and people are simply shitty, no matter what their biology is. I'm not falling into a ""woke"" mentality or feel that ""men are evil"" and ""women are infallible."" Absolutely not. 

I want to do my bit to make the world better for everyone, but I can't do that unless I'm better. 

Does anyone have anything to add to this? Am I making any sense?

I heard that a reason why these gyms exist is because there are some women who are scared of being harassed by men. Honestly, I go to the YMCA (I'm a male), and I have female friends who go there too, and they tell me that they enjoy working out in a gender-neutral place, and that no guy has ever bugged them there. They also told me that they think the idea of female-only gyms is silly and very sexist. At the gym that I go at, nearly all guys (including me) don't go to there to hit on women. We only go there to get exercise, and most people (including me) usually mind our own business when excising and rarely talk to anyone there. I have actually never seen a guy hit on or bother a woman at the gym that I go to. That's the experience at my gym though, I can't say the same thing about other gyms.

However, I never understand female-only gyms.  If women feel embarrassed going to the gym, then they shouldn't go to the gym, do it at home, or run in the park, instead of discriminating against men by labelling them all sex perverts that only go to gyms to hit on women, how absurd. The very same bullshit could apply to straight men, they could claim they feel embarrassed when gay men look at them, but could you imagine the uproar if they had straight-only times in the gym?

If feminists actually do want equal rights, they can't have stuff like female-only gyms. Places like those are flat-out discriminating against a certain group of people.

If people want real equality, then female-only gyms etc aren’t equal. It’s very simple really. That's my opinion though.",TRUE,9,0.68,32,,/r/MensRights/comments/jzb80q/whats_your_opinion_on_femaleonly_gyms/,AncientBodybuilder

21/11/2020 16:00,"That Johnny Depp petition we all (hopefully) signed, has just removed everyone's comments. How can we stand up for men's rights, when companies and media outlets prefer to silence/warp the truth, rather than admit that men can be abused?","So, this 'supposedly' unbiased company, which is utilised to spread awareness of injustice, has now being muted, due to a small percentage of comments being reported by (assumedly) Amber Heard simps; which is a huge disadvantage to those who speak truthfully from experience and not just a 'paid, voiceless bot', as Amber has termed. This vastly popular petition to instill justice in the system now looks as though it is just paid bots and not actual people voicing their opinions on the matter. 

Although I am a female and was never a Johnny Depp 'mega fan', I must say I am a fan of seeing the correct outcome of all DV cases, because regardless of which sex you are, we are humans and regardless, we are all capable of committing abuse. Yes, there are women who are abused and don't fight back, but yes there certainly are men who are abused, who do not fight back as well. 

The slogan was 'Believe All Women', but truth be told, it is incredibly hard for a man to stand up in public and say 'Believe Me Too.' It is honestly laughed upon and disregarded. Well, I say 'Believe All Men', because it takes actual guts for a man, in this day and age to say 'I was abused, yes by a woman and here is all the evidence, here are the tapes, the photos and the witnesses attesting to my statement'. A man of today, is (supposed) to be 'macho, insensitive, dominant and repressed emotionally' and could never be abused (apparently). This is a generalisation, unrelentingly fictional, as each person and specifically, each case is unwaveringly unique. 

With all of the evidence coming to light in their case, I have watched time and time again, certain media outlets pushing agendas. 
I genuinely feel sorry for Johnny Depp, who in this instance, was trying to do the right thing. He tried to run when she was violent, he stood by and was emotionally abused into thinking he was worthless; his only crime; falling for a beautiful woman. A manipulative woman nonetheless. A woman, proven with a history of abuse, caught on tape admitting physical violence, with a string of obvious back-peddling lies alongside mismatched body language actions, entangles her depositions, which suggests obscure truth-twisting in order to suit her 'Believe All Women' claims. That she, 'Amber Heard', was a victim of violence and definitely not 'Johnny Depp'... 

The people are very aware of the truth, thanks to the evidence. It begins with her extortion letter to Johnny Depp, demanding obscene amounts of money and assets which he denied her, thus leading to the allegations, which she coincidently sold to TMZ through doctored 'evidence' to punish him.

The powerful Murdoch-owned media companies and unfortunately now, even '.org websites', are purposefully shunning freedom of speech and truth. 
I am incredibly disheartened that there are still supporters of  Amber Heard in this world, although very few; but evidently they are so caught up in the 'Damsel in Distress movement, that actual logic is displaced and that is what we are fighting against. Corruption, lies and a venomous movement which removes all equal rights for men. Amber Heard is a perpetrator of manipulation, perjury and consistent lies. 

I don't know what else to do but read court statements, news from reliable sources and watch Johnny Depp communities closely, in order to be aware of this painful mishandling of justice. 

With the main court case for Johnny Depp next year, I am hoping that the verdict is in his favour, without the obvious corruption of Justice Nichols to push their agenda. 

I will not discontinue my plight of spreading awareness and continuing this discussion openly, as I believe the only way we can remove a stigma, is to educate ourselves and I personally feel that Johnny Depp winning his case would greatly benefit men's rights and show that men can be victims too.

last night i (23 f) unknowingly, and unintentionally, raped my boyfriend (24 m). you must know, i would never ever in my life hurt this man, and i love him very deeply. i can tell both of us have no idea what to think or do, and i have no idea what he is thinking as of this morning. we don't live together, so i'm at my house right now, and we haven't talked since i left his house this morning. i want to give him space, i guess thats the best thing to do right now. i really need help or advice or SOMETHING, because i'm loosing my mind. 

So heres what happened: we went out with friends last night and had a great night! we get home around midnight, stay up for a bit watching tv, and then go lay in bed. he closed his eyes and fell asleep kinda fast. now in the past he has told me to wake him up with head before, and after hearing him moan in his sleep, i really wanted to surprise him or make him happy by doing that. so i started to rub and then suck his dick, which got him hard, but he never said a word or made a noise. eventually i came up and wanted to ride him, so i asked and after no response i decided to just lay down and go to bed. THEN he rolls over smiling at me with his eyes still closed, thrusting towards me, within 2 mins of me stopping. when i asked about continuing he said something, that i don't fully remember, but made me hop on top of him. he even told me to spit on it when i first hopped on. as i started riding him, i'm 99.99% sure he moaned and was moving. after a bit he started to cum inside me, with no warning to me (which is not normal, he is the ""pull out king"", he has never cum inside me before) and he freaked out slightly, pulling me upward off of him, like he normally would, and finishing on himself. afterwards, he kept staring at me so weirdly and wouldn't say what was up. so i finally went to bed, very embarrassed that it was weird because he came in me. i had NO IDEA i had just raped him.

next morning he gets out of bed early and gets dressed without saying anything. when he was brushing his teeth i tried to say good morning and ask if we should talk about the previous night. he said yes and had me start, after prying it out of him he finally said that he was totally asleep when i had sex with him, he didn't remember anything except waking up to cumming inside me, and that basically i raped him. then he left to get plan B, i took it when he got back, and after some awkward exchanges and silence, i left without even hugging him. 

like i said, we have not talked all day, i planned on waiting for him to reach out. he didn't break up with me either. i just feel so disgusting and numb, i'm not sure how to feel. i explained all the signs he did give me, while asleep, to have sex with him before i left his house, along with how sorry i was and how much i love him. all the signs he gave were things he would have done if it were in the morning, or he was sleepy/sleeping, and he wanted to have sex. i've woken him up with head before too. i'm just so confused on where and what line i crossed, i know i crossed one. how will he ever trust me or feel secure with me again? will he even still love me after this? will he ever talk about this with someone or seek help? he's so introverted idk what he's thinking. thanks for taking the time to read and help.",TRUE,23,0.89,23,,/r/MensRights/comments/jykjo4/i_really_need_help_and_mild_judgment_only_please/,rad_but_sad777

>So, what explains the championing of this gentle father image in these gender-progressive times? I think some of it is a response to the possible increase in fear of men generally. With all the discussions of ""rape culture"", the good father is, almost by definition, domesticated   and therefore safe. From a political/economic perspective he's tied  down and predictable. He's obviously got a loving wife, so we assume  his  mental health is being taken care of. At least we can all still point to  him as a good man who *won't let us down* like all the other men do.

When I was a kid, I used to take swimming lessons. I always viewed it as unfair that boys had to take their shirts off at swimming pools but girls did not have to. Every time I went to the pool, I always felt “more naked” than the girls. And that line of thought has stuck with me with other categories like on public tv shows, it would allow to show boy’s nipples but not girl’s, ie **protecting** the girls (that’s how I viewed it).

I know there are women today saying that not allowing them to show their nipples is actually an oppression, but I never viewed it that way because I see it as a privilege to be shown “less naked” than males. 

Again, I might literally be the only person on earth to think this but I just wanted to ask has this thought came across anyone’s mind ever?

In conversations and discussions about how “easy” men get it, I make sure to bring up the issues and discrimination they face. But at the same time, in conversations about how “easy” women get it, I make sure to bring up the issues and discrimination they face too.
When I joined this sub and saw posts advocating for Jonny Depp against Amber Heard, posting about International Men’s Day, body positivity for men, statistics for the hardships men face and general men’s rights activism, I was stoked! This is the stuff I’m passionate about and joined the sub for.

However, without a specific reason, the teachers, in the second and third grade, began to hate men, a lot.  We lost about an hour of class every day because each teacher had to lecture about how much the males sucked, how stupid they were, that they will never be able to do anything in life, that they are the waste of society, and that females are perfect  in every possible way, of the deities that we must worship because they are infinitely superior to us.I am not exaggerating.

Every Men's day should start with an injection of estrogen. Two injections if you're overly masculine. And shave your chest in the name of equality.

After the injection we must fast until noon so that our muscles deteriorate, because muscles are also sexist. You must fast all day if you're a especially large (toxic) male to prevent man-spreading and taking too much space.

You must then go to your local libraries and borrow all books on biology. Take the books home and burn them in your backyard, because they are also sexist by promoting the absurd idea that men and women are different.

If you catch yourself mansplaining throughout the day (aka stating your opinion and following it with facts), then you must immediately hit yourself over the head with a book on feminism to promote submissiveness and prevent further mansplaining.

At the end of the day you will not masturbate, especially to pornography.

20/11/2020 5:44,"Child Support, Economic Slavery & Misandry","#INTRODUCTION
*Men's reproductive rights are rarely if at all discussed in the mainstream. Just look at what happens when you tell a feminist that there are 'no rights to take away from men' in a conversation where she screeches about pro-lifers wanting to take away women's abortions or hell just look at what happens when you tell the average person that there are male statutory rape victims who are still paying child support. You are always met with the same confused and or angry look or you are hit with male hyperagency/'women pay child support, too' type of arguments.*

*In more pro-choice countries, women are not seen as active agents who consent to be parents once intercourse takes place and because of that they are not legally obliged to be parents - they have access to safe abortions. Am I saying it is always easy to get an abortion especially if you live in a traditional pro-life family? No, but on average a woman has the choice to refuse parenthood no matter the cause of the pregnancy. On the other hand, a man is assumed to be an agent who consents to be a parent which means he can be held accountable for his actions and since men don't have the same autonomy as women, the only way to hold them accountable is to order men who don't want to be parents to pay child support to the mother who has full control over her partner's or ex-partner's fate, that is she decides whether the child is born or not (the father has no legal right to intervene, but he can be held accountable and forced to financially support the choices of the mother. It is unlawful of him to refuse to do so).*

#MEN'S REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS
I dug up some info on men's reproductive rights, specifically in the US, and the idea that a man is accountable for his actions, that is he consents to be a father at the time of conception is so embedded in family courts that even boys/men who have been a victim of stolen sperm, also known as 'sperm jacking', sexual abuse or even men who are not the genetic fathers of the child can sometimes be ordered to pay child support. ""The child is an innocent party, therefore his/her needs have to be put before the needs of the man"" is a common excuse which courts have used to rationalise their misandry.

Quoting from: [When male victims are held accountable](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/talking-about-trauma/201902/when-male-rape-victims-are-accountable-child-support%3famp)

>Seyer was 12 when he was raped by his 16-year-old babysitter Colleen Hermesmann who became pregnant and in 1989 was charged with statutory rape. Instead of being convicted of rape, Hermesmann was declared a juvenile offender under the non-sexual offense of 'contributing to child misconduct'. Seyer was subsequently court-ordered to pay child support. 

That's one story where a victim of rape in spite of being a minor was ordered to pay child support by the very same system that is said to 'protect' rape victims. We can confidently assert this is economic slavery and victim blaming. The story continues:

>In 1993, at age 15, Seyer appealed this decision to the Kansas Supreme Court, arguing he should not be liable for these payments. He maintained that his babysitter (Hermesmann) took advantage of him when he was too young to give consent. The court ruled against him and the judge stated that because Seyer initially 'consented' to the sexual encounters and never told his parents what was happening, he was responsible for supporting the child. 

This is a a clear example of male hyperagency, victim blaming and rape culture. It gets even worse:

>This court case set a precedent for male rape victims to make child-support payments. The financial needs of the child outweigh the court's interest in deterring sexual crimes against male minors, even if statutory rape is the cause of conception. 

Clearly, the 'financial needs' of the child don't just 'outweigh' the needs of the victim as the judge made it quite clear he was okay with the boy being raped as he 'consented'. This isn't the one and only incident where the 'needs of the child' have been used to rationalise such disgusting treatment of male rape victims. There are more stories some of which are quite recent. 

>In 2014, Nick Olivas of Arizona was forced to pay over $15,000 in back-payments to a woman who raped him when he was 14. She was 20 years old at the time. 

Being forced to pay over $15,000 to your rapist and having to fear the consequences of not doing so (such as potential jail time, loss of civil rights) definitely doesn't sound oppressive, does it?

>In 1996, the court heard the case of County of San Luis Obispo v. Nathaniel J in which a 34-year-old woman became pregnant after sexually exploiting a 15-year-old boy. He was also forced to pay child support, and then Deputy Attorney General Mary Roth alleged: 'I guess he thought he was a man then. Now, he prefers to be considered a child'.

Can you imagine if a girl was told 'I guess she thought she was a woman then. Now, she prefers to be considered a child' in response to her being a rape victim and wanting to be relieved from the obligation of having to financially support another human for years?

The next story is that of a male rape victim who was incapacitated and incapable of consenting, but was still ordered to pay child support in spite of the fact that the courts were aware of the incident. 

Quoting from: [Fatherhood by conscription](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1761333)

>In 1992, an Alabama man (S.F.) attended a party at the home of a female friend (T.M). He arrived at the party intoxicated and shortly thereafter passed out in a bed. The other partygoers eventually left for the evening, leaving S.F. in the sole care of T.M. When S.F. awoke the next morning, he was surprised to find that all of his clothing had been removed during the night. Over the next few months, T.M. would openly boast to several people about how she had engaged in sexual intercourse with S.F. while he was unconscious. She would even go as far as to describe the evening as one that had 'saved her a trip to the sperm bank'. T.M. gave birth to a child, and genetic testing confirmed that S.F. was the biological father. The state of Alabama, on behalf of T.M., brought an action against S.F. to collect child support. The lower court entered a judgement against S.F., requiring him to pay $106 a week and also $8,960 in arrears. 

>On appeal, S.F. argued that the court should relieve him of the liability given that 'he did not have consensual intercourse with T.M. and that he was a victim of sexual assault by T.M. The court, however, rejected S.F.'s argument, stating: 'The child is an innocent party... [A]ny wrongful conduct on the part of the mother should not alter the father's duty to provide support for the child'.  

In other words, the rapist boasted about being a rapist, bragged about impregnating herself, but the court refused to take that into consideration and instead put the victim in the good 'provider' box that was built for him. These are just some amongst possibly tons of other cases where a male victim of rape has been held accountable for his rapist's misconduct and forced to financially support her child. In each case, the court ruled against the victim despite knowing he was the victim. 

There's more and this one is beyond ludicrous:

>Similar to S.F., in In re Paternity of Daniel S.H., a Wisconsin father, Daniel, claimed that the mother, Jennifer, engaged in nonconsensual sexual intercourse with him after lacing his drink with “a date rape drug.” In an action to collect child support for the resulting child (a son named Derek), the lower court allowed Daniel to introduce evidence of nonconsent. Even so, the court placed the burden of proof on Daniel, requiring him “to prove all factual issues by clear, satisfactory, and convincing evidence."" Ultimately, “[t]he jury found that Daniel’s sexual intercourse with Jennifer was involuntary."" Nevertheless, the lower court still required Daniel to pay child support.On appeal, Daniel argued that the lower court’s order was in error and that “the jury’s finding of lack of consent should bar or reduce his child support obligation.”

>The Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, however, agreed with the lower court because “[t]he paramount goal of any child support decision is to secure the best interests of the child” and that, in this case, “Derek was not at fault” and thus “was entitled to receive child support from both parents.” Despite agreeing with the lower court’s determination of child support, the Court of Appeals nonetheless disagreed with the lower court putting the issue of consent to the jury. Specifically, the Court of Appeals found no statutory basis for permitting a jury to consider consent when ruling on the issue of child support. Instead, the Court of Appeals ruled that the only real question the jury had to answer was whether Daniel was the father: “Daniel had a right to have a jury decide whether he is Derek’s father. However, Daniel admitted he was Derek’s father. As a result, a judgment of paternity was entered. When the court determined that Daniel was Derek’s father, Daniel’s right to a jury trial was extinguished.”

*What about 'stolen' sperm, a.k.a sperm jacking and paternity fraud?*

Control over men's reproductive and sexual health is not as uncommon as most people would like to believe. In fact, it is very common.

Quoting from: [Battered men: the hidden side of domestic violence. A review of CDC data](http://www.batteredmen.com/NISVS.htm)

>Approximately 10.4% (or an estimated 11.7 million) of men in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get pregnant when they did not want to or tried to stop them from using birth control."" 8.6% (or an estimated 10.3 million) of women in the United States reported ever having an intimate partner who tried to get them pregnant when they did not want to. (page 48) 

One example is that of a man who was ordered to pay child support because he had engaged in oral sex with a nurse who allegedly took the sperm from his condom and used it to impregnate herself. 

>In 1983, Emile was visiting his sick parents at a Louisiana hospital. One evening, a nurse, Debra, offered to perform oral sex on him, but only if he wore a condom. He accepted. At the end of their sexual encounter, Debra agreed to dispose of the used condom. Emile, however, never witnessed this disposal and thus could not say what Debra ultimately did with either the condom or its contents. Nine months later she gave birth to a child, and genetic testing revealed a 99.9% probability that Emile was the father. The two never had sexual intercourse, only the one instance of oral sex with a condom. Nearly ten years later, the state filed an action against Emile to collect child support. Despite his objections, the lower court ordered the man to pay $436 per month, $17,909 in arrears, and 5% court costs. 

>The Court of Appeals of Louisiana affirmed, stating that '[t]he fact of paternity obliges a father to support his child'. In addressing the issue of Debra's self-insemination without Emile's consent, the court dismissed the point, merely noting that '[Emile's] own testimony showed that he had some sort of sexual contact with the plaintiff around the time frame of alleged conception'. The fact that any sexual contact occurred was sufficient to hold him liable for child support. 

To summarise, engaging in sexual intercourse is enough to hold a man accountable for a child even if that child was conceived because a woman impregnated herself without his knowledge. 

Here's another one:

>An appellate court in Illinois reached a similar result in Phillips v. Irons. In that case, Dr. Richard Phillips and Dr. Sharon Irons began a dating relationship, during which time the couple engaged in oral sex on three occasions. The two never had sexual intercourse because Irons told Phillips that she was menstruating and thus needed to refrain from vaginal intercourse. Nonetheless, Phillips alleged that, unbeknownst to him, Irons used Phillips’s semen (obtained from oral sex) to successfully inseminate herself. Subsequently, Irons gave birth to a daughter and, soon thereafter, filed a “Petition to Establish Paternity and Other Relief ” against Phillips. Because he had ended the relationship with Irons over a year prior, Phillips had no knowledge of Irons’s pregnancy or the birth of the child. Nonetheless, DNA testing proved that Phillips was the biological father. Ignoring the deceptive manner in which the child was conceived, the court awarded child support to Irons in the amount of $800 a month, which was later increased to $1,600 a month.

Self-insemination is just one way a woman can deceive a man and impregnate herself. Lying about being on the pill, poking a hole in his condom are two other ways this can happen. 

Paternity fraud is another issue that arises from strict liability. However, it is a more tricky one as some states have enacted protections to protect men from the practice such as Texas which passed a new law which allows men who doubt paternity a chance to file a claim. This allowed a Dallas man who was jailed due to his inability to pay child support to contest an accusation that he was the biological father. After a DNA paternity test disproved the claim of paternity, he was released from jail. 
[Child support when paternity is in doubt](https://mensrights.com/child-support-when-paternity-is-in-doubt/)

However, that doesn't eliminate paternity fraud as a whole and stop it from happening, say, in other states or countries. A couple of examples are the story of Chris Atkins who spent 11 years raising a daughter that was not his, but was still required by law to pay child support because his name was on her birth certificate. Atkins claims that despite paying, he doesn't have visitation rights.

The other story is that of a man from Detroit, Carnell Alexander who refused to pay child support for a child that was proven to not be his. As a result, a warrant was issued for his arrest.

#GENDER INEQUALITY 
Quoted from: Fatherhood by Conscription: Nonconsensual Insemination and the Duty of Child Support (link above)

>In her book, The Neutered Mother, the Sexual Family and Other Twentieth Century Tragedies, Professor Martha Albertson Fineman points out that “[w]hile the dominant aspirational story for the past decades has been one of spousal ‘equality,’ great gender inequality in the allocation of the burdens and costs associated with family operation continues to affect how this story is played out in real lives.” The current approach to child support adjudication is a prime example of the inequality to which Fineman refers. Indeed, the few commentators who have criticized the court’s current approach of holding male victims liable for child support have done so primarily based on the way in which the current approach violates gender equality.

>Ellen London’s commentary is particularly instructive: 'The traditional conceptions of power, dominance, and victimization employed by these courts precluded the judges from providing the defendants with a fair or adequate solution. Little doubt exists that the judges in these cases would have written different opinions if the victims were female—illuminating how men are viewed as the responsible party in a sexual encounter and women have no corresponding agency.' In fact, consider the one case in which a court was called upon to decide whether a female victim of sexual assault was liable for child support. In DCSE/Esther M.C. v. Mary L., a mother refused to provide support for her three minor children on the basis that they were “the result of an incestuous relationship with her brother,” and, as such, “it was not a voluntary decision on her part to have the minor children.” In ruling, the court did what no court has ever done when confronted with the child support obligations of a male victim of sexual assault—the court ruled that the mother may not be liable. According to the court, “[i]f the sexual intercourse which results in the birth of a child is involuntary or without actual consent, a mother may have ‘just cause’ . . . for failing or refusing to support such a child.”

The concept of paternity, male responsibility and liability are so ingrained in the system that professor Hubin notes:

>Under contemporary legal standards, it has 
become a “settled approach” that “genetic relationships establish legal paternity regardless of whether the genetic fathers gave legal consent, or were capable of giving legal consent, to an act of
sexual intercourse that resulted in the pregnancies.”

As one commentator describes:

>""[W]hile courts have declared that child support obligations are dependent on voluntary parenthood, they are often reluctant to look to consent for guidance.” Despite the number of times the question of consent has arisen, every single court has answered it in the affirmative—holding that, yes, the father, minor or not, is liable. 

Perhaps, actual systemic progress has been made, but I, alongside many other people, are yet to see it. Stop the abuse. Don't hold victims accountable. Give men and especially boys the right to choose.

I have to say this messed with my mental health a lot. Not only I feel down I feel anger, like, I invested in myself and this is my reward ? Yes, this is my f\*\*\*king reward for self improvement. THIS is the society in which we live. A joke...nothing more.

First I only found out it was international men's day... Well today. I'm living here in the US and hadn't heard anything about it. It's actually kind of sad that it's not getting the coverage that it deserves. So if the rest of media people won't talk about it then I will.

So on behalf of me as a woman to the rest of all of you. I love you guys. We love you guys. We respect you and thank you for all that you do.

Thank you to the dad's working that extra shift not help not only his family but maybe his friend, a sister, a brother, a boss, or even himself.

To the men who offer that helping and go unsung, thank you.

To the father's who taught lessons to their communities and families, thank you.

To the dad's (like mine) who were never there, we forgive you. Love you. Please come home.

To soldiers, security guards, factory workers, health care workers, and anyone puting their life on the line both in work and in play, thank you for being our heroes. Thank your for holding the line.

To the inventors, scientists, artists, thinkers, engineers, builders, all creators please continue to make the world beautiful.

To you guys dealing with depression, loneliness, abandonment, false accusation, pain, loss... Both in people and in faith... I choose to believe humanity is good I am so sorry for the pain you have felt. It will get better. You are loved. There are people who will listen to you. And if no one has reminded you yet it's very heroic to keep going for even just one more day. That little act of getting up out of bed and not letting the pain win something that is to be admired about men.

I'd rather not ramble on for too much longer but I just wanted to say happy international mens day. And as my grandfather once told me ""never let these damn fools drive you crazy"".

Lots of love and respect

That aside, what I'm suggesting is we all donate a small amount to a men's charity- for example prostate cancer research. I donated £5 to Prostate Cancer UK which isn't much but if we all do that it will make a difference. I attached a screenshot if that counts as proof.

The problem with feminism and mostly the patriarchy that they claim exist is that is a pseudo science and not falsifiable.
For example, if something is harder for women that is because men hate them. If something is easier for women it’s because men think they are worse at it.

Not exactly normal, but it's their business, right? The problem is, he was, as the woman discovered later, was wearing a condom. People on this board are debating whether or not this man raped this woman. The woman was asking OP if legally speaking, she had a leg to stand on. I genuinely don't understand what the issue is, though. Okay, so the man is a bit of a prick, but a rapist? I don't believe so. If the man had *not* been wearing a condom when they had agreed that he would - ""ghosting"", I believe the term is these days - *then* I'd agree that an assault had been committed. As it is, though, I'm being called a scumbag for disagreeing that an actual crime has been committed.

19/11/2020 11:18,"It's international men's day today, so the BBC posted an article bashing men","Take a quick read for yourself. No evidence...just casual sexist discussion about how women are supposedly better than men.

""Have women CEOs coped better with Covid than men?""

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54974132](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54974132)

Would it be published if the genders were reversed? Oh no. Would it be published if you replaced men with white and women with black? What do you think?

I would really, really strongly encourage as many of you as possible to tweet the BBC about this article and their CONSTANT anti-male rhetoric. @ bbcpress and #bbccomplaints may be good tags to use.

It would also be really great if you could officially complain here (takes just a few minutes):

[https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaints](https://www.bbc.co.uk/contact/complaints)

I would also ask you all to make it your mission this year to call the BBC out on their constant sexism. Because they are explicitly feminist, despite being a publicly funded organisation in the UK and they have probably spent more time talking about the damn gender pay gap than they have talking about all men's issues combined about 5 times over. Even if they rarely have an article about male suicide rates they will do the 'this is why we need more feminism so men feel they can talk more' thing and 'balance' their article out with stats about women.

20/11/2020 6:43,Do men's rights proponents care about opressive gender roles?,"Hi, i am a new guy to this sub and to social issues in general, and i have heard about men's rights only from people oposing feminism and from what i read here, a lot of you share similar opinions.

From what i read on r/feminism and feminist fb pages there is a lot of disscusion on breaking the enforced gender stereotypes of men being the confident bread winners and women being the house and children caretakers and how theese stereotypes negativeley affect mainly women.

Now, i've seen in this sub brought up the issue of discrimination of men in child custody rulings; the prevalence of men in dangerous jobs and the different standards male abused by women are facing.

It seems to me that these gender roles feminists keep going on about are also a problem for men's rights as well, since women get custody because they are seen as traditional child raisers, are demed unfit for phisical jobs, and the negative stigma abused men face is due to the idea that they must be ""strong""


So what am i asking is: Do men's rights proponents can agree with feminists in this particular issue of  gender roles? Or is feminism only about a gender war against men? Because, from what i've seen on Reddit, this sub has a lot more overtly anti feminist posts than r/feminism has about hating men.",TRUE,1,0.52,18,,/r/MensRights/comments/jxd36b/do_mens_rights_proponents_care_about_opressive/,floating_helium

For men in general, I've got a lot to say. Men rarely get praise as a group or as an individual. Yet they plod along, taking care of their families, creating marvelous things, building businesses and careers full of relationships.

I am not a movie watcher at all, but once or twice a year I like to indulge with my husband. This time we watched the Wes Anderson animated film ""Isle of Dogs"". I chose this movie since the reviews were fantastic and I like animated films. I found a few things about the film rather unsettling, but one thing that left me totally disturbed and disgusted is that a female high school student professes to have a crush on a 12 year old boy (the main character), and even worse is that they develop this ""romance"" and the two characters end up arm in arm sharing ice cream after the 12 year old calls the high school senior ""attractive"". My advice to this literal child being hit on by a near or actual adult would be to say no and tell an adult. 

Like I said, I don't typically enjoy movies so I don't know how normal this is but it really turned me off. I checked on the wikipedia page to see if it was mentioned in the critical response and that maybe I missed it somehow when checking the reviews. Apparently this wasn't a problem for reviewers?

And people talking about how this should be how modern day ""masculinity"" is, I think that's stupid. Because modern masculinity isn't about what you wear - it's about your values and actions. We've moved past toxic masculinity (I hope). So to say that Harry Styles wearing a dress is setting a new standard for what masculinity should be is just nonsensical.

Wikipedia has an article about it but doesn't have anything to say about its replacement, though it discusses reversals where a woman saves a man. But I find it hard to believe that the reversals will become popular. 

Or perhaps I just don't get it. Perhaps the kids nowadays don't care who saves whom. Or what. In that case young women watch romantic movies where men have to saved and young men movies where men save only robots or planets or other men.

19/11/2020 8:06,The Limits of Male Friendship,"The MGTOW people often get me thinking.  Because it seems to me, the social, political and legal realities in ALL western countries, and perhaps, increasingly, all countries, does give one reason to ponder regarding male/female relationships.  The top 20% of men everywhere, from the families that are (a) richer and (b) more functional (yes, the two overlap a lot) have been, are now, and will be fine.  The issue is the 80%.  I would say the bottom 10% of women have been, are now, and will be facing nightmare lives.  As, obviously, will the bottom 10% of men.  But that leaves 70% of men and women between the bottom 10% and top 20%, and this is where the differences, I feel, will be stark.

&#x200B;

Most men will fit into this 70% category.  What are they to do?  They could try to 'nab' one of the top 20% of women, but this will be difficult, as the top 20% of men will get most of these women.  So a few per cent of the 70% category of men will be able to 'marry up' with the top 20% of women, and these men, too, by and large if they play their cards right will have no problems either.  So let's say that leaves us 65% of men.  What about this majority?

&#x200B;

Well, as I see it, they are going to have an awful lot of difficulty.  The 70% middle band women unfortunately can and will exploit the extremey unjust system against their male partners.  Also, more often than not, all else being equal, the more desirable jobs will be given to women.  So they will have less desirable jobs, they will have permanently extremely unbalanced external forces that will bear on their romantic liaisons with women, and relations with any children of their union if it gets that far.

&#x200B;

For me, the best thing men in the 65% can do is contribute to their female relatives, particularly sisters/cousins who have children - ie. help the chidlren of their female relatives.  This is something that feminism wouldn't really seek to spoil since there isn't potential male/female conflict here.

&#x200B;

Men can also, must really, invest in male friendship, typically with other 65%er men.  But my sense is, there is a limit to this.  When push comes to shove, people will give their kidney, money, and time to family over friends.  This is human nature.  This is the limit of male friendship.

18/11/2020 10:31,We need a registry to track this stuff.,"So I've been bouncing this around in my head for a while now. I think that we need a registry or database for keeping track of everytime governments or the UN creates a policy that hurts men or excludes them from the benefits that they give to women. 

While this sub (and others like it) have been an awesome place to bring these issues to the forefront and discuss them I feel like we need a place where we can compile and store this data.

My reasons are twofold:

**1.)** **It a great way to catalog all of this information for future reference.**

Many of us know that the situation is bad. But we don't know the full extent of it because of how insular this community is and how isolated sources are. Let's face it, a lot of what we have is fairly disparate because the academic institutions and media only let one or two studies or expose slip through. Oftentimes the information is accidentally discovered while the researcher is seeking to prove the opposite or is a by-product of some other study. Having this all in one place in an open-source format would allow us to take advantage of our numbers and potentially enlighten other people to what's happening.

**2.)** **The powers that be want to shut us down**

We have to face the fact that social media platforms are hostile towards any space that presents men's issues in any way that doesn't completely vilify men. Groups like this one have been getting banned for months by Fakebook, Reddit, Twitter and the like. In addition, YouTube has waged an all out war against content creators who are sympathetic to men's issues. 

In addition, in the U.S. (Where most of the social media giants are headquartered), the President elect has already signalled that he is going to use his power to clamp down on what he sees as abusive language on social media. 

In my opinion, this is just the excuse that woke administrators are looking for to discriminate against us. We have little idea what all he plans to do. But if his work in Senate or as the VP is any indication of his leanings, I'd say that it's going to be bye bye for men's groups.
Hopefully I'm wrong. But I'd like to make sure that we have a safe haven for when this does happen.

19/11/2020 13:14,An outsider’s gripe.,"Hello, I’m Henry, a male feminist. As I’m reading through this subreddit, I’m seeing all these examples of trendy feminism—simply praising women and demonizing men, instead of actually looking at the forces which shape the gender roles that make self-determination within gender difficult. It’s shallow, it’s harmful, and it’s not fucking correct. So, I felt like I needed to explain where I am in terms of thinking, and that this is the minority of feminism.

I believe all humans should be on level ground, with the same wages, the same privileges, and so on. But I cannot for the life of me reconcile all those buzzfeed articles with the values I was taught from my parents, from literature, and from what I’ve learned through going about my own life with an active sociological imagination. 

Women are currently disadvantaged in many ways when compared to men—take The Beauty and the Beast, a beloved Disney film that puts the main female character living with someone who exhibits abusive behavior. Eventually she’ll soften him into a prince with her “feminine charm” but it’s plain to see that this is demeaning to everyone here. A screaming, threatening man should not be held as something normal—it’s demeaning to say that we are abusive by nature, and it’s dangerous to teach children who watch this film that this is acceptable behavior. However, by repeating the “men are rapists” adage, these trendy feminists ARE NOT HELPING. This implies that it is in some way our nature, as men, to be violent. I think we all likely take offense to that. 

In sum, feminists are not the big bad evil. There are simply some people who take a good thing too far and fall back into sexism, and it makes me sad.

With the post about the wife posting about her 'free loading stay at home husband' who was looking after her child, all the comments were agreeing with OP saying that the husband was a freeloader and that as the man of the house he should work, some even went as far to say that they should get a divorce.

18/11/2020 0:25,My wife makes me feel like a loser,"I am a 30 year old guy and my wife is 25 years old. We come from different cultures but in the same profession. We have been in a relationship for almost four years. Got married a few weeks back. She is basically a short tempered and stubborn human being and most of the times I come in the line of fire for things even a random guy on the road does. Starts with arguments on why I do not respond to people a certain way and ends up in calling names and ofcourse pulling me down mentally and emotionally. I feel drained after these episodes. I have thought of breaking up with her a number of times but I just can’t do it; i don’t want to do it.

I thought atleast marriage will bring about some positive changes, but unfortunately all that changed was that now my family is also a part of the numerous ways I “disappoint” her. She has not even met them yet; have spoken over the phone a couple of time thats all. She feels it’s ok to talk bad about my father and mother to me, also because she knows it will hurt. The usual are the comments of how they raised me, how they are backward etc. As a son it hurts me unimaginably. But she has a particular knack of bringing the ball to her court always.

I feel intimidated as the arguments continue. I must say that I am not at my best behavior too during these arguments. I also shout and respond to abuses with abuses (not always), but eventually I lose the argument. In the end I come out as the bad guy who is a disappointment. I don’t know how she does it.

Just today I told her that I would like her to control her anger towards me atleast in public. But every other word that comes out of my mouth is a “trigger” for her . As usual, she ended up shouting at me, accusing me of things, how my career is not progressing and how I am not able to be rich. (She is a professional who is well educated and trained in her field). Finally I gathered the courage to say two things. 

1. Why do I have to be tagged as the “provider” , when she is a modern highly educated professional herself.

2. Someday I might just get up and leave.

To the former she replied, “aren’t you supposed to be the husband”(sarcastically) and to the latter, “please do, I am least bothered”. 

I need help. I don’t want to break up with her. I want to make it work between us and start a family. The time has come when she will finally be meeting my parents and they have no idea about our chemistry. They are not city folks. 

Can you tell me how I should tackle her anger issues? I am a sensitive person emotionally, being called a disappointment and the constant bullying is taking my morale down.

&#x200B;

This story contains references to sexual misconduct and assault that may be troubling to some readers. The names of the students have been changed out of respect for the students’ privacy.  The responding student did not reply to multiple requests for comment, including an email containing all the allegations made against him.

&#x200B;

Three students reported allegations of misconduct and assault against the same student to the Title IX Office in early 2020. And after the office shut down the three students’ cases, the case was sent to the admissions office, where Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw concluded — based on a report from Title IX investigators — that the responding student had not violated the Fundamental Standard.

&#x200B;

The ultimate rejection and winding nature of the cases’ trajectory exemplify difficulties students face in pursuing sexual violence cases, according to students and faculty. Advocates said that the students’ experience also illustrates the difficulty of pursuing cases that take place before matriculation, as some of the alleged conduct took place prior to enrollment.

&#x200B;

Cases of sexual misconduct that involve students who have been admitted to but have not yet enrolled at Stanford are handled by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Such cases are not subject to University policy or Title IX’s jurisdiction and are instead based on the requirement that applicants and prospective students act in accord with the Fundamental Stanford under a preponderance of evidence standard, according to University spokesperson Dee Mostofi.

&#x200B;

Mostofi wrote that the staff of the Title IX Office, who addressed the students’ initial reports and aided Shaw’s investigation, care deeply about these issues and continue to support a safe and respectful environment.

&#x200B;

“The Title IX Office provides support for students to ensure a fair, timely and effective Title IX process for conduct that falls within its jurisdiction,” Mostofi wrote. “This fair and impartial process is essential for conflicting perspectives, which can lead to difficult outcomes for some parties.”

&#x200B;

An external philanthropic organization that some of the reporting parties and the responding student were involved in conducted a separate investigation into the issue and found that allegations against the responding student could not be sustained, according to Mostofi, although the organization declined to comment on how the determination was reached and what standard was used.

&#x200B;

Clara first met the responding student at a summer program unaffiliated with Stanford before their senior year of high school. “We referred to each other as family, because that was what the program was premised on,” Clara said. But during a walk back to the responding student’s dorm, Clara said he touched her inappropriately, claiming he was drunk and high, only walking those claims back after Clara asked him to stop.

&#x200B;

Symere met the responding student at the same summer program, crossing paths with him again after their acceptance to Stanford. In an off-campus location with 15 other people, Symere said she was tired, and lay down on one of the room’s beds. She said the responding student offered to let her put her head in his lap: “We called each other family,” she said. “I thought it was out of goodwill.”

According to Title IX documentation Symere provided to The Daily, Symere told the office the responding student soon started touching her hair and arms. She asked the responding student to stop, and pulled her hands away from him, though he continued. Later that night, she said, the two fell asleep on the same bed.

&#x200B;

She told the office she awoke to the responding student thrusting his erect penis against her lower back, later pinning her right arm so that she couldn’t move, while inappropriately touching her. Throughout, he told her he had never had sex before. Symere said she said “No, stop,” multiple times, while tucking in her clothing and attempting to pull away. Symere said the responding student didn’t stop, continuing to inappropriately grope her while asking for sex. 

&#x200B;

Symere eventually managed to grab her friend’s phone, setting an alarm to wake everyone up. “I didn’t want to cause a scene, but I wanted him to stop,” she told The Daily. When the alarm went off, she said the people in the room woke up, allowing her to leave. 

Njuzi first met the responding during a Stanford program the summer before matriculation, where Clara and Symere warned her separately to stay away from him. Once the school year started, the two were placed in the same dorm. She said the responding student asked her to watch a movie with him, as the two were in a tight-knit friend group.  

&#x200B;

At lunch, she said the responding student had denounced a rumored assault at a party. “He said, ‘Oh my god, that’s so disgusting,’” Njuzi said. “I thought he seems like he hates that, he would never do that.”

&#x200B;

But as the two watched the movie, Njuzi said the responding student started to bombard her with compliments, asking if she was in a relationship and saying that he had never had his first kiss. She said he pressured her for a kiss for 20 minutes, while she told him that she did not want to hurt their friend group, politely trying to tell him no.

&#x200B;

Eventually she gave in: “I started getting scared,” she said. “I realized I didn’t really know who he really was, and there wasn’t anyone in our dorm.” The situation escalated from a kiss without consent, Njuzi said, with the responding student groping her body, “dry humping” her and moaning, while she laid there unmoving.

Afterward, she went to the library.

&#x200B;

“I stared at the wall for a couple of hours,” she said. “I convinced myself mentally that I liked him, and he wouldn’t have done it if he didn’t care about me.” The two then were “a thing” for two weeks before she broke the relationship off.

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

Title IX contacted Clara in November of her freshman year, setting up a meeting where she said she was told the Title IX Office, based on a report from a community member, had reason to believe that she was a harmful influence on the community for spreading rumors about the responding student. Clara said she told the office that she had only told others about her own experiences when she felt intervention was necessary, like when the responding student started to prey on other women.

&#x200B;

Mostofi declined to confirm the details of the meeting.

&#x200B;

Clara, Symere and Njuzi, who had gotten in contact with each other through their shared experiences with the responding student, then decided to open preliminary inquiries into their cases with Title IX after consulting with each other.

Clara’s case was “tossed out pretty fast,” she said. Title IX emailed her to write that as her case had taken place prior to her and the responding student’s enrollment, it was outside of Title IX’s jurisdiction, according to documentation provided to The Daily. She decided not to pursue the case further, as she thought that serving as a witness to Symere and Njuzi’s cases would lead her to have a bigger impact.

&#x200B;

At the time of the investigation, the scope of Title IX included alleged wrongdoing that impacted someone affiliated with the institution, regardless of the status of the respondent or geographic location. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos’s August regulations have since limited the jurisdiction of Title IX only to activity that takes place at a school or at a school-related event.

&#x200B;

Symere said that as her experience with the student happened before matriculation, Title IX said the University was not responsible for the student’s actions.

&#x200B;

“I found that insulting,” she said. “They questioned me at least five, maybe seven times, about every little detail. None of them did anything.” 

&#x200B;

Mostofi wrote that during the investigative process, it is not uncommon for the Title IX Office to speak to students several times with the intent of ascertaining the facts of a case, which are then presented to the Title IX coordinator. The Title IX coordinator has final authority over whether a claim, if true, is a violation of Stanford’s Title IX policy, according to Mostofi.

&#x200B;

And after a protracted investigation — Njuzi said she would go to the Title IX Office every couple of days to ask for a decision — the office told her in her outcome letter, which was provided to The Daily, that her claims, even if taken as true, did not rise to the level of a Title IX violation. 

&#x200B;

Under Title IX, discrimination on the basis of sex can include harassment, sexual assault, dating and domestic violence, stalking and nonforcible sexual violations. Stanford’s Title IX procedure defines sexual assault as any sexual act directed against a complaintant without affirmative consent.

&#x200B;

The existence of a dating relationship between the persons involved, or the fact of past sexual relations between them, should never by itself be assumed to be an indicator of affirmative consent, according to the Title IX procedure.

&#x200B;

Mostofi declined to comment on why the claims did not rise to the level of a Title IX violation.

&#x200B;

Out of frustration, the three booked office hours slots with President Marc Tessier-Lavigne, who referred them to Senior Associate Vice Provost for Institutional Equity & Access Lauren Schoenthaler.

&#x200B;

The three said Schoenthaler was not of much help, at points making harmful comparisons. Njuzi said when she asked Schoenthaler why her claims did not rise to the level of a Title IX violation, Schoenthaler compared the situation to a “creepy” uncle and a child.

&#x200B;

“‘You might feel a little uncomfortable if he gives you a hug,’” Njuzi said Schoenthaler said. “‘But that’s just how family works.’”

&#x200B;

Symere said Schoenthaler compared Symere’s steps of reporting to “a kindergarten tattle-teller who proceeded to inform college counselors of \[Schoenthaler’s\] son cheating on a test years ago.”

&#x200B;

Schoenthaler wrote in a statement to The Daily that the tone and content of what was attributed to her was inaccurate and mischaracterized the conversation. She wrote that she did not nor would have suggested that it is alright to give someone a hug without affirmative consent, and said she would never equate an unwanted hug with sexual assault. “I addressed these students with dignity and respect,” she wrote.

&#x200B;

Schoenthaler did note that “I do often discuss that some conduct is wrong but does not rise to the level of a policy violation, and I state that conduct is on a continuum giving examples of conduct on the continuum.”

&#x200B;

Following continued pressure from the students, Interim Title IX Coordinator Cathy Glaze alerted Symere in late April that the Office of Undergraduate Admissions would be stepping in on the case, with the Title IX Office aiding in conducting an independent review to determine if the responding student’s conduct violated Stanford’s Fundamental Standard, according to emails provided to The Daily.

&#x200B;

According to Mostofi, final outcomes of an investigation by the admissions office could include a suspension or the revocation of an admissions offer. The University rescinded an incoming freshman football recruit’s admission in April after investigating his involvement as a witness to alleged sexual assault in 2018.

&#x200B;

There is no one way schools address allegations of sufficient wrongdoing outside of Title IX’s scope, with methods depending on how the school is organized and the mission of different departments, according to Christine Helwick ’68, who has filled in for attorneys on leave in Title IX investigations at Stanford and also served as general counsel for the California State University system.

&#x200B;

Given difficulties communicating with Glaze during the initial Title IX inquiry, Symere requested Glaze step down from the case, leaving Dean Shaw as the sole decision maker. The same Title IX investigators who turned down Symere’s case were assigned to investigating the potential Fundamental Standard violation.

&#x200B;

“These are the same people who I talked to and said my case has no validity,” Symere said. “There was bias coming in.”

&#x200B;

Mostofi wrote that investigators do not make determinations about which cases can or cannot proceed.

&#x200B;

The students — Symere leading the case, with Njuzi and Clara serving as witnesses — said the Title IX investigators were difficult to work with throughout the process. They insisted that she was under the influence at the time of the incident, Symere said. Njuzi said they zeroed in on how she hadn’t directly said no.

&#x200B;

“Asking a victim multiple times, ‘Did you say no?’ defeats the purpose of establishing what the correct kind of consent is in the first place,” Clara said. “If you don’t say yes, or if a person is trying to back out, that’s not consent.”

&#x200B;

Mostofi wrote that investigators ask all parties about verbal and nonverbal signs of consent to get a complete understanding of what happened. “The Title IX Office continues to use affirmative consent as the basis for whether there was a sexual assault or attempted acts of sexual assault,” Mostofi wrote.

&#x200B;

Symere also provided screenshots of the responding student texting about women on campus, at one point writing “I’d take a bite outta that,” adding a peach emoji, which is often used to refer to buttocks.

&#x200B;

In Symere’s outcome letter in August, which was provided to The Daily, Glaze wrote that the investigators determined that “it is more likely than not that there was some sexual activity” at the off-campus location, “and that you found it upsetting and violating.” But, the investigators also concluded that “you may not have accurately perceived the extent to which you were signaling your non-consent to the Respondent. Thus, \[the investigators\] were not able to find that the Respondent had violated the Fundamental Standard.”

&#x200B;

Glaze wrote that Shaw accepted the investigators’ findings, and the Office of Undergraduate Admissions would sustain the respondent’s admission and enrollment. Glaze added that the incident occurred before the respondent had received Stanford training on affirmative consent and positive sexuality.

&#x200B;

“I gave nothing,” Symere said. “So I don’t know how or why I’m measuring my non-consent. If there’s not any consent, you shouldn’t be proceeding with anything.”

&#x200B;

“I don’t understand how something sexual can occur that makes you feel violated and disrespected and not violate the Fundamental Standard — which is literally about treating others with respect,” she added.

&#x200B;

The Fundamental Standard states “Students at Stanford are expected to show both within and without the University such respect for order, morality, personal honor and the rights of others as is demanded of good citizens. Failure to do this will be sufficient cause for removal from the University.”

&#x200B;

Mostofi declined to comment on Symere’s concerns about Shaw’s decision.

&#x200B;

Contemporaneously with Stanford’s investigation, an external philanthropic organization that two of the students were involved with also investigated the matter and independently determined that neither of the allegations could be sustained, according to Mostofi. The philanthropic organization declined to disclose information to The Daily about the investigation, including whether it occurred. 

&#x200B;

The foundation also declined to comment on how the determination was reached and what standards were used. According to two of the students, the foundation declined to answer the student’s questions about the ruling or allow her to speak about the situation with the foundation’s director.

&#x200B;

And the students said Stanford’s decision could have dangerous consequences for other students on campus: “Life continues beyond Stanford,” Symere said. “With this decision, Stanford is reinforcing his view that what he’s doing is okay.”

&#x200B;

\*\*\*

&#x200B;

In the 2018-19 academic year, the Title IX Office received 279 reports of sexual harassment, sexual violence and gender discrimination, with 20 reports of nonconsensual intercourse and 20 reports of nonconsensual touching, according to the 2018-19 Title IX/Sexual Harassment Annual Report released by the University. Most cases had a “non-investigation outcome,” an umbrella term for matters that are concluded without a formal investigation.

&#x200B;

Of the non-consensual intercourse allegations, there were just four formal completed investigations, with two findings of a policy violation. For the non-consensual touching allegations, there were eight completed investigations, with four findings of a policy violation.

&#x200B;

Only a small percentage of those who say they’ve experienced sexual violence report the incident to the Title IX Office.

&#x200B;

14.2% of respondents to a survey organized by the Association of American Universities reported experienced at least one instance of nonconsensual sexual contact at Stanford, with 31.1% of undergraduate women reporting an instance. 

&#x200B;

Advocates said difficulties students face in pursuing sexual violence cases stem from both the people and the procedures involved. 

&#x200B;

Maia Brockbank ’21, who co-directs sexual violence prevention and Title IX for the Associated Students of Stanford University (ASSU), said college campuses, including Stanford, can be breeding grounds for repeat offenders. She added that the University has an incentive to not take responsibility for such cases when possible. “Still,” she said, “other private university administrators are not making policies that are this harmful and damage survivors.” 

&#x200B;

Activist and law professor Michele Dauber, who declined to comment on a specific scenario, said the University does not have a written policy governing reporting incidents before matriculation. She said a lack of such a policy was especially dangerous, given that some students who matriculate at Stanford have interacted with other matriculated Stanford students whether at summer programs or by attending the same high school.

&#x200B;

Mostofi declined to comment on whether the University has a written policy governing such reports.

&#x200B;

All advocates interviewed said they had concerns about Shaw’s qualifications to adjudicate such cases. Brockbank said adjudicating cases of sexual violence is not Shaw’s job. 

&#x200B;

“It feels like it’s part of a pattern of the Title IX Office doing everything they can to reduce their caseload and punt it to other people,” Brockbank said. 

&#x200B;

Shaw did not respond to request for comment directly, and Mostofi, responding on behalf of the University, declined to comment on Shaw’s qualifications.

&#x200B;

Some advocates also said that Glaze and Schoenthaler have been hard to work with and, at times, dismissive of student concerns. Dauber said her experience working with those involved in crafting and executing Title IX policies is entirely consistent with that of students on campus. 

&#x200B;

Dauber said that the lack of trust in the Title IX Office has harmful consequences for students considering reporting incidents and that now is the time for the University to take dramatic steps in order to create trust, including by making procedural and personnel changes.

&#x200B;

“This is a hair-on-fire emergency,” she said. “If you have offices and procedures that students don’t trust, no one will report, and that makes a dangerous campus.”

&#x200B;

Brockbank and Julia Paris ’21, who also co-directs sexual violence prevention and Title IX for the ASSU, commended the three students for their efforts to obtain justice through the University’s Title IX system, adding that they worry for students who don’t have the ability or willingness to go through the system.

&#x200B;

“How many others are out there who don’t want to go through this obstacle course?” Brockbank asked.

Take this for example

>Roman morality required that all gladiators be of the lowest social classes, and emperors who failed to respect this distinction earned the scorn of posterity. [Cassius Dio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassius_Dio) takes pains to point out that when the much admired emperor [Titus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titus) used female gladiators, they were of acceptably low class.  
>  
>Some regarded female gladiators of any type or class as a symptom of corrupted Roman appetites, morals and womanhood. Probably as a result, he banned the use of female gladiators in 200 AD.

Doesn't this mentality look familiar to you? Say modern morality?

Its completely moral for female spectator sitting in the comfort of auditorium and watch male slaughtering each other, but its immoral if reversed

Women never needed a movement for their privilege in the first place, gynocentrism and the disposability of male went as far as when societies and civilizations begun.

Not to mention general labory, slavery, warfare in ancient times were mostly all bond to the sacrifice of male, female mostly had the best protection and comfort it could have at the time. If anything its the lack of technology that contribute to the low quality of life women have back in time instead of social problem, put it simple: if the time is bad for women, then its even worse for men.

If you are a male slave in ancient time, compare to a female slave, who do you think would have a better chance of surviving? When feminists points out patriarchy, they ignore all the other factor that comes into play, comparing low class female to high class male is a gimmick they use all the time.

The funny thing is, from every source, let it be books, movies, tvs, games, when people point out the example of patriarchy, i see gynocentrism. There really are two sides to everything afterall. The entire foundation of feminism is built on the belief of predominance of the patriarchy, but that is just one-sided view, without addressing view-point from both angle, there will never be equality.",TRUE,37,0.84,24,,/r/MensRights/comments/juz7yn/how_could_one_argue_patriarchy_is_a_thing_while/,Starforce2005

I find it really upsetting to see people invalidate male experiences like that- it’s almost heartbreaking to see- I’ve never experienced anything like that yet I still have passionate views about it so I can only imagine how the men who have been abused or raped by women feel when they see comments like that about how men don’t have to worry about it.

***""Wikipedia seems to think so:***

***Sexism is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender. Sexism can affect anyone, but it primarily affects women and girls.""***

[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexism)

*""Thinking further on refuges.   Women's refuges aren't for fleeing a man who was verbally or emotionally abusive.  They are for women who are* *running for their lives*.    Yes, there are certainly men who leave a verbally or emotionally abusive woman.....but how many men are frightened that she'll get murdery?""

***""Where I live, we have homeless shelters just for women, women with children, and then co-ed. None just for men, despite the homeless population here being mostly men. A homeless woman will be taken in immediately but a man might have to wait, and then the help he receives will be cut off eventually.*** 

***I delivered the rape story deadpan, the same way I deliver pretty much everything. It's kinda my thing. I do it without realizing and my ex wife used to hate that my face was almost always blank when we talked about serious issues. No, they didn't tell me I shouldn't have gotten drunk or that I should have been ore careful, they just laughed. To be fair, I think I should not have gotten so drunk or invited her to crash at my place, even if no one else said it.*** 

***I'm not saying it's purposeful sexism that breast cancer gets more promotion, more money for research, and more attention. I just think that people in general care more about women's issues than men's. I'm just as guilty of it as the next person. I would put myself through some serious hardship without batting an eye if it would save my GF from having to deal with it. A lot of men here would do the same thing for their wives and GF's. Is it sexism?*** 

***I think that men do have some grievances in some areas, mostly when it comes to family and divorce court. The rest....maybe not so much.""***

*""I believe that the society we live in now has an extremely unhealthy cultural attitude towards sex and gender and it's perfectly logical to me that everyone loses out because of this. Women, without a doubt, experience sexism. Other genders also experience sexism. Men absolutely experience it too. Being a feminist is absolutely about advocating for women's rights in the hopes they become equal with men, but we cannot and must not look over the importance that feminism carries for men too. We must all be liberated mainly from expectations.* 

*A lot of women who have been severely hurt by men and who have been through trauma from men, including myself, go down the ""men are trash"" twitter rabbit hole sometimes. I think it's a pendulum effect from one extreme to the other. They explain that it's because ""good men will realise it's not about them"" and whilst I agree, I think men's issues will never be solved whilst we're still at the peak height of that swing. I went through a phase of being extremely frightened of men, mistrusting of men and sometimes I still am, because trauma isn't magically erased after counselling and treatment. However, I recognise now all of the hurt that men experience as a result of sexism. Men experience body shaming. Men are targeted with a whole host of expectations like being a provider, being strong, being able to control emotions, not crying, not appearing in any way to deviate from masculinity. Men are good people who are also being crushed by the system. It's time we stop comparing our harms and focus on the issues as individual and valid problems. Men's Rights Activists need to stop focusing on condemning feminism, intersectional feminists are already trying dismantle white, middle-class feminism.*

*Men's Rights Activists and Feminists need to work together on liberating men from high risk of suicide, liberating men from the stereotype of the absent, cold father, liberating men from only being able to express anger instead of sadness and vulnerability, and liberating men from dysfunctional or abusive relationships because they are not being supported in their childhood or in their adulthood from the trauma they experience and the misinformation they receive.""*",TRUE,7,0.74,27,,/r/MensRights/comments/juz7eb/whats_your_opinions_on_the_stuff_that_these/,AncientBodybuilder

16/11/2020 4:47,Just had an idea,"Alright so about a week ago I made a post describing my negative experiences with women and how they are often times bullies, and its easy to get away with it when a man is on the receiving end due to societal barriers keeping them safe. And I also mentioned that I have noticed on countless occasions women helping one another out, often at a mans expense. Simple because women tend to ""stick together"" as long as there is no personal attachment to the guy in question, but if its a random guy neither of them know they will often treat him as disposable if it suits their needs. Anyways, I have heard time and time again women saying that they are oppressed, and I even asked in another group that had over ten thousand people how women are oppressed because I truly wanted to understand. Not a single girl responded. And its not because they didn't see the post, it was trending in that group they simply chose to ignore the question. But surely there must be some reason for why women are so bitter towards men.. surely there must be something to this so called opression. The best I could come up with is that due to men naturally being the stronger gender, we had advantages, especially back in the day when the world was more male dominated and women leaders were scarce/non existent. And overtime, the majority of our leadsrship is still men, as far as government is concerned that is. And somehow or another women associate this fact with them being opressed, and that is their excuse to believe that men as a whole are the enemy. Even us normal guys that aren't in positions of power, that choose to live normal lives with regular jobs. We all have to experience the brunt of the man hatred because of a very small percentage of men at the top that run things? 

This was the best thing I could logically come up with, because in the United States of America, women are far from opressed, women in the US are the most privileged in the world and it has turned them into spoiled brats. In fact I think men are the ones that are opressed in many cases, particularly when it comes to women accusing a man of something or a woman bullying a guy, its very hard to fight back or get nasty in return because we all know women can flip a switch in a second and play the victim card the moment a guy decides to stop tolerating their disrespectful b.s. and then the guy becomes the villain. (I lost a job because of a situation like this)

I'd like to hear your thoughts. Why do women think they are opressed? Why do they work together so much especially to help each other out at mans expense? And why do they think that all men are guilty because of a few men at the top? (If thats even the reason) .

15/11/2020 16:08,How to make change.,"Whenever I look at the top posts here, the majority of them are always examples in the real world of men drawing the short straw or overcome the bias they are faced with. However are we still in the exploration phase, isn't it already proven that all these issues are real? I can give you statistical and argumentative evidence that men in first world countries are on average significantly less happy, live less fulfilling lives and face problems like an empathy gap or significantly lack of acceptance in any other role than the disposable, valueless male. 

So why are we still focusing so much on evidence, wouldn't it be better on focusing on way to deal with these problems with the means we have? E.g. guidelines to give young men which give them compromises between still experiencing a meaningful relationship with a woman and not getting exploited/ruined or forced into the typical male roles. Or therapeutic ways to deal with hate, discrimination and lack of empathy towards one. 

**Currently we are not on a path that will bring change**, we are **stuck** in this 'evidence' phase, since it is easier and in the short run more emotionally fruitful to outrage about perceived injustice instead of trying to understand how that injustice came to be and finding ways one can contribute to change that injustice. When I look at these 'example' posts I see comments that emotionally outrage how 'bad' and 'evil' the unjust party is, instead of analysing and trying to understand the system that lead to this situation, in order to find ways to prevent it, in order to bring **change and progress**. I can very safely predict that if I would look at this subreddit in 10 years, we would still be at the same spot we are today, crying about how bad the system is, without actually trying to see the big picture and find change.",TRUE,27,0.93,10,,/r/MensRights/comments/juijzm/how_to_make_change/,jukutt

In the United State there are 27.3 rape incidents for each 100.000 citizens. A far cry from her 1 in 6. Keep in mind, incidents, not 100% proven cases. Yes, it should be 0 but it's not.

However in reality not every woman is an angel that does nothing wrong and therefore not every woman deserves the effort of men. Women are not entitled to be put on a pedestal by men. The statistic that 1 in 6 women will become victims of attempted rape is wrong. When she was talking about implicit gender bias she used negative adjectives for girls ""pinks sweet fragile"" and positive adjectives for boys ""active strong blue"".

Men and women are both oppressed in society in different ways. There is a lot of toxicity online, so why are you guys focusing on it and rehashing it? Why not just find and surround yourselves with quality friends and women?

14/11/2020 22:17,Addressing homicide by men against men,"Suicide is often talked about on this sub as an unsupported men’s issue. But homicide is also an act which affects men at a much higher rate than women. Men are more likely to commit homicide and die as a result of homicide.

As the Bureau of Justice Statistics puts it: 

“Although the killing of women, or “femicide” as it is often called, tends to receive intense media coverage (Pritchard and Hughes 1997), men are far more likely to be both perpetrators and victims of homicide. Over the past four decades, nearly three-fourths of all homicides have exclusively involved men. About 90% of all perpetrators are men, and ∼81% of their victims are men. Moreover, 78% of the victims of female offenders are also men. Stated in terms of rates per 100,000 population, men commit murder ∼10 times as often as women, and are victims nearly 4 times as often.”

Feminist theory puts this down to ‘toxic masculinity’ and gender roles, essentially placing the blame on men. I’d be keen to know what you guys think this is caused homicide to affect men so much more frequently (ie. biological vs cultural), whether this is something we could or should aspire to change and if so, by what approach.",TRUE,7,0.82,55,,/r/MensRights/comments/ju2lat/addressing_homicide_by_men_against_men/,madtayham

13/11/2020 23:22,How do I counter the argument that circumcision has no negative effects?,"I have seen comments in sub Reddits, Youtube comment sections, etc from guys who were circumcised when they were babies or extremely young saying they have no problem whatsoever with sex/masturbation and they never knew it was a problem until someone told them.

But as someone who is not circumcised, I know the pleasure a foreskin brings and the lack of pleasure that comes without having one.  And living normal life without the skin retracted is an extremely irritating feeling as the clothes are constantly rubbing against it. They (the ones who were circumcised as infants or young kids) don't know what it's like to be intact but someone who is intact can know what it's like to be cut.

I really do believe deep down that being circumcised is objectively worse in terms of masturbation and normal everyday life. Most of the circumcised males don't know that because they never knew it in the first place. But many of them are going around telling people that because they are fine, the practice itself (on infants) is perfectly fine and even awesome. And people, even some women use this and say ""see, circumcision has NO negative side effects"". How can I counter this argument?

&#x200B;

Edit: I may want to clarify the question. I as an uncircumsised male know there would be negative side effects if I got cut. But if someone who was cut in infancy (and reports NO negative effects) is in the same room as me and using that as an argument for infant/child circumcision, how can I counteract that point in an efficient and meaningful way?",TRUE,10,0.76,158,,/r/MensRights/comments/jthgsf/how_do_i_counter_the_argument_that_circumcision/,wicnfuai

13/11/2020 8:57,I've been falsely accused - Trying to remain positive has never been harder.,"This is my first reddit post ever - It may be a little long. Here we go.  I'm a 31 year old male, currently living in south Florida. A little over a year ago I met a women from Venezuela. We met in April but she had arrived here to the US the previous December. I met her on my birthday and within the same night, I took her back to my place and we had fun. Within the next few weeks we start hanging out more often and enjoying each others company. As I began to catch feeling for her (and presumably her for me), a few weeks in she lets me know that she lied/was lying about her real name and age, and  if that was not bad enough, she later tells me that she has been escorting for the last few months.

Despite these massive red flags, for one reason or another - we continued to talk. Looking back, a lot of the ""overlooking"" that I did was due to mostly wanting to help her better her situation for her family (she left two young kids behind in Venezuela), trying to see the better in her, and not wanting to give up on the idea of having a partner. I'm a single father of a beautiful 10 year old girl and in retrospect, I feel that I wanted to give her some sort of traditional family... Boy how that backfired.

About two months later, to try and help her out  - My Mother and I took her in to live with us. My mother's on disability, she lives with me since she's unable to fully support and take care of herself. She's an excellent grandmother to my daughter (love their relationship) and she does plenty to help. My mother and my ex actually kicked it off pretty well, it was good for my mother to have someone else around the house who she could convers with and what not.

During the next few moths we continued to date and take things a bit more seriously, this is despite various occurrences where I've caught her attempting to contact escort agencies and other men. Every time, she would end up convincing me that she was not doing anything - and despite my best judgments, even at the time, telling me to tuck it and run - I loved her and kept giving her the benefit of the doubt.

Come October of last year, we get married (knowing that I gambled with so many stupid decisions in the name of love - is making this hard to write). She kept pressuring me into getting married because of her situation and we had made it a goal of ours to help bring her children over once we were more settled.

Well, come February of this year (the beloved 2020), we were having some troubles and she was acting  a bit distant, we both were actually. She even began sleeping in my mother's bed the last few night she stayed with us. One day I was looking through my phone bill and noticed she was receiving/making a lot of calls and texts to  a particular number... When I googled the number, it belong to a Tattoo shop that she just visit a few weeks prior - she started having an affair with the owner.

She had an iphone but she used the cell phone that I was lending her in order to text and call this gentlemen over the last few days. I lent her this phone because she was an IG narcissist and the camera on my S9 allowed her to take far better pictures and workout videos. So the idea that she would use my phone to ""do her dirt"", as opposed to her iphone - like she always has - was odd, she knew I had access to the meta data on every bill - I see now she was leaving bread crumbs for me.

When I found this out she was at work (cleaning an Airbnb) and I began texting her about it. She was just trying to deny it and saying that I was just insecure and ruining her life and that she does not need me or any man. She says that she's going to move out and that she'll be dropping my phone off tomorrow.

This is where I made, what is turning out to be, the worst decision of my life - I decided to go to her job. I wanted to speak with her to find out why she was doing this. However, the moment she saw me there she just started screaming at me and refused to speak to me about it, blaming it on me. At one point I ask her for the phone, she refused to give to me.... Next thing I do is walk outside, and I call my phone company to tell them to freeze the service on the phone. I figured if I tell her the phone doesn't have any service,  she'll hand it over since she can't do anything with it. I'd like to mention, she had her iphone with her this whole time, so I knew very well she was not going to be phoneless - I just wanted my phone back, especially since she used it to cheat on me (was my flawed thinking at the time).

As I'm entering her place of employment a second time, I receive a call from the man she was cheating on me with. He apologetically begins to tell me, that she told him our marriage was just for ""papers"", that she did not love me and we were going to be getting a divorce soon. He said if he had known he would have never been with her.

Now, I go back in the house/Airbnb where my wife is to tell her about the phone and the guy who called me. This time around we got into a little scuffle over the phone. I would never hit a woman, but she sure hit the heck out of me. Essentially, she started hitting me, I held on to her wrists and held our hands over our heads in order to get her to stop... Then she bites my chest (since I was holding her hands). I push her off, she falls backwards on her butt - I make a run for it, she keeps punching me on my way out and tears my shirt trying to prevent me from leaving.

I leave and after much contemplation, I decide not to call the cops on her but instead to file a restraining order the next day. When I file the order, the lady who works their lets me know that my ex also filed a restraining order just a few hours earlier. Month later, I go to the hearing for the restraining order - I get arrested and I'm now facing life behind bars for burglary, assault, and tampering with a witness.

Come to find out my ex gave various accounts of what happened, in one of her accounts she pretty much said that I beat her mercilessly. Striking her repeatedly in the face and body with a closed fist. Due to this I lost my Job, a job I've been working at for about 5 years - I moved up to the point where I was finally doing well financially. All gone.

It turns out that she was researching faster ways to citizenship when being married to a US spouse - assuming she was going to be leaving me anyway. It turns out that through something called the VAWA act, immigrant women who claim that they were assaulted by a spouse can self petition for  citizenship, for free. This is what she did.

Two days before the incident, she was researching this topic, as well as local DV shelters to call and ""Ways on how to make your husband jealous"". There's really no evidence that indicates that she was hit - They took and provided photos, but it looks like they were just going through the motions  as there were no injuries other then a scratch here or there.

This is long but the point is - I'm scared for my life. I worked so hard to be in my child's life and to be able to provide a better life for her and just like that, it's all been taken and I'm looking at life in prison. I find it crazy that I was never asked for my side of the story - The police just took her word for everything right away, without question,  and despite the lack of evidence. The whole ""burden of proof"" idea is good in theory - But in reality, I feel like I'm trying to prove a negative - they assume you're guilty - it sucks.

I already decided to fight this until the end - I have a daughter, a mother, sisters who all love me and know I would never do something like this.. In fact, a lot of people have a stigma of letting others know if they're being accused of something like this for fear of what they might think - However, I posted my situation on FB after I disappeared for a few weeks in depression. The amount of love an support (mostly from women, ex coworkers, family friends, from school etc.) was overwhelming and reassuring.

The idea that I lived in this country my entire life, it's all on record, every school, every address, no previous arrest  records. Meanwhile, she has only been here less then a year - we have proof that she was escorting, attempted to commit immigration fraud in the past (before this incident), there's plenty of proof that she lied to the police multiple times. She's committed more crimes in her short stay in this country, then I have in my entire life here - and they (my own government) just turns they're back on me and decides to believe her, without even the benefit of asking for my side of the story. They have no idea if she was a murderer, or con artist in her country before moving here.

I take responsibility for allowing myself to be a in this sort of situation, for the decisions I made that left me vulnerable for this sort of thing to happen - But I cannot take a plea deal for something I did not do. Yet, you hear all of the time about people being wrongfully convicted of crimes... So I'm a little scared. I'm not built for prison whatsoever to make matters even worst but I feel, had I done something, I would be able to accept it and do the time... But to go to jail for something I did not do, that's a tough situation.

&#x200B;

I feel like my life is on hold. I can't look for a job (not with this case pending), I'm scared to date. I never figured I would be in a situation like this...  And the worst part of it all, is that she's likely going to get off scot-free. File the self petition, get her paperwork, and move on with her life like nothing happened. In these situations, the government aides the criminals.

Then, after the election, she gave a Vice Presidential acceptance speech in which she gushed continuously about women and thanked Joe Biden for choosing her on the basis of her [gender](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iu7AbNaKFqc?start=126&end=150) (from timestamp 2:06 to 2:30 in the video).

Not only is all of this explicitly anti-male, but also, imagine what kind of message feminists would be sending if Biden ends up no longer being able to fulfill the Presidential role and Harris takes over...  Feminists are so obsessed with proving that women can do anything that men can do, but then for some reason they seem to think that the only way a woman can ever stand a chance at becoming President is if someone is given such an obvious leg up in order to help her get there.  Is there any reason we should have any respect for this ""achievement"" that Harris did nothing to earn?",TRUE,24,0.73,34,,/r/MensRights/comments/jt7bod/the_vice_presidency_is_being_handed_to_kamala/,DignifiedAlpaca

When you are chosen by several perceived higher value beings your feat is viewed as impressive and when you go out with perceived lesser valued beings your behavior is treated as degrading.

The shitty joke about the key and the lock is spot on.

Because women are supposed to ""choose"" in society them being chosen is degrading, and men being chosen by a lot of the choosers is truly an impressive feat.

14/11/2020 5:12,Woman here to ask some questions in peace,"First off just saying again that I come in PEACE I just genuinely want to ask some questions and start a conversation with some people. I just stumbled to to this subreddit and wanted to ask your opinions...

So first I’ll say that I agree with MOST things from both feminist and men’s rights ideologies. I think men as victims in sexual assault/domestic abuse isn’t talked about enough. I think the high male suicide rate isn’t talked about enough, and I think that our society denies men from having feelings and being a human being by saying to “be a man” and “grow a pair”, which in the long run I think is mentally damaging. 

However I also think that women are systematically discouraged from pursuing their careers compared to their male colleagues (because women are traditionally home makers). On the other hand I also think that our society doesn’t place as much value on traditionally ‘feminine’ work - caretaking, raising a family, teaching, etc. There have also been decades of policy trying to take away women’s access to birth control and abortion - which stops a woman from making personal medical choices.

I see people on both sides who are extreme. Feminists who hate men and men’s rights people who hate women. But for the most part I agree with the majority of what both sides are saying. So I guess my question is: What specifically do you have against feminism? Is it an institutional issue or do you actually disagree with the ideas behind it? And second, why can’t the logical and well meaning people from both “sides” come together and work towards a society that is more equal for both genders?

Ok that’s all. Thank you!

12/11/2020 7:15,Could someone help me fact check my essay on the discrimination of men in the justice system?,"so first I wanna thank the awesome people who gave me sources for my essay on my last post. You guys are awesome.

Here is the progress I have made on my essay:

&#x200B;

 

In the past few years, there has been a bias against men in courts. Ever since modern day feminism started, men's rights have been getting disregarded and women are being sexist towards men. Men's rights are getting looked down upon and the men in society are getting unfairly punished for it. This has led to men being discriminated against in the justice system.Ever since modern day feminism started, men's rights have been disregarded and women are being sexist towards men. Men's rights are getting looked down upon and the men in society are getting unfairly punished for it. This has led to men being discriminated against in the justice system.

One example of sexism against men is that if a woman writes a man's name down for a child that isn't his, the man still has to pay child support. There was a good example of this in 2017 where a man was forced to pay $65,000 dollars in child support when his wife cheated on him and got pregnant with another man without his knowledge. Another good example is in 2015 when a man was a wanted man because he refused to pay child support for a child that wasn't his. Men shouldn't be unfairly punished just because a woman decided to screw them over by writing their name on the paper. There should be a law that makes it to where scientists have to DNA test the baby to see if the names match up. If the names do not match up, the woman is fined a minimum of $10,000 dollars.

Another example is that in most divorce cases the woman gets 90% of belongings plus the children. Some would draw the conclusion that it is because women or more capable to take care of children. What about the cases where the man wants to divorce because the woman is a bad person? There are some women who will marry a person, have a child with them, and then proceed to divorce them to both mentally destroy the man and screw him over financially because divorcing is a very long and expensive process. There is also the factor of the crimes that either side has committed in the past. Speaking of crimes...

Yet another example is that if a man gets accused of false rape, the man will have their lives ruined in most situations even if the woman dosen't have any evidence. This is because women are 39% less likely to be incarcerated, and when they *are* incarcerated their sentences are 23% shorter compared to men. Men receive longer sentences compared to women. People should get equal sentences no matter the crime. In general, Women are less likely to be punished in the justice system. Even if a woman is punished, they usually get shorter sentences. This creates a narrative that insinuates that women can't do anything wrong and that if someone does anything wrong, it's usually the man's fault.

11/11/2020 8:45,An Excellent comprehensive PHD Research on Discrimination Against Men in Finland (applicable elsewhere of course). See This post for summary,"[https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2017/10/22/comprehensive-research-on-discrimination-against-men-in-finland/](https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2017/10/22/comprehensive-research-on-discrimination-against-men-in-finland/)

This is a chapter-by-chapter summary of [*Discrimination Against Men: Appearance and Causes in the Context of a Modern Welfare State*](https://lauda.ulapland.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/61748/Pasi_Malmi_v%C3%A4it%C3%B6skirja.pdf?sequence=1),  a 2009 doctoral dissertation by Pasi Malmi (University of Lapland) that  provides an impressively detailed and balanced investigation of  discrimination against men in Finland (the theory and results actually  give almost as much detail on discrimination against women, although men  will be the focus here).

Chapters 5 to 8 are the most important. Chapter 5 explains six biases  that cause gender discrimination, chapter 6 delineates the patriarchal  and matriarchal subsystems of Finnish society, chapter 7 examines the  various discourses that justify discrimination against men, and chapter 8  analyzes a database of gender discrimination complaints made to the  Finnish gender equality ombudsman, a third of which were made by men.

*(Length: 1,800 words.)*

**Chapters 1 to 4 (introductory/background chapters)**

Chapter 1 situates the perspective taken by the dissertation within  gender studies. It rejects anti-feminist and anti-women perspectives,  and the glorification of traditional masculinity and gender roles (e.g.,  the [mythopoetic men’s movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mythopoetic_men%27s_movement)).  But it also rejects the “critical studies of men” paradigm, which sees  men as the main causes of men’s and women’s problems, refuses to  criticize feminism or women, and does not believe that discrimination  against white, heterosexual, middle-class men exists (pp. 20–21).

Chapter 2 defines various relevant concepts, and explains that the  findings from Finland are intended to be relevant primarily for the  Northern European welfare states, and secondarily for other European and  Anglo-American countries (pp. 32–34).

Chapter 3 gives a brief overview of current or traditional viewpoints  on what causes direct or indirect discrimination or mistreatment of  men: gender roles, hegemonic masculinity, industrial capitalism,  feminism (specifically gender feminism and victimization feminism), and  exploitative women (pp. 36-44).

Chapter 4 develops a theory of sociocultural evolution, which says  that ideas that are simple, exaggerated, and coherent with popular  paradigms generally win out over their rivals, regardless of whether  they are true or backed up by evidence. This happens due to functional  selection (p. 57), unintentional biases (p. 63), and interest group bias  (p. 71), among other factors (see summary, p. 115).

**Chapter 5: Applying the Theory to Gender Discrimination (p. 118)**

This chapter develops a general theory of gender discrimination,  centered on a typology of six different biases that cause gender  discrimination (p. 127).

The **masculine bias** and **feminine bias**  are unintentional gender biases caused by the processes that simplify,  exaggerate, and mutate people’s mental memes or ideas according to their  gender (p. 127). For example, a person’s conception of domestic work or  childcare will be centered on their own experiences or contributions,  which are partly determined by their gender, and so they will often  downplay/exclude the other gender’s contributions (e.g., yardwork vs.  housework) (pp. 135–138). As a result of these biases, segregated groups  and networks of men or women tend to have a masculine-biased or  feminine-biased culture of values, priorities, concepts, words, stories,  jokes, stereotypes and beliefs that can lead to practices that  discriminate against the other gender (p. 120). For example, a group of  female social workers might decide that women are better custodians of  children and default to recommending custody to them (pp. 141–142).

The **masculist bias** and **feminist bias**  come from interest groups, networks, or movements seeking to advance  the status of men or women, respectively. Masculism and feminism have  sexist and anti-sexist branches (p. 143). The modern **sexist branch of feminism** includes theories like *feminist standpoint epistemology* (which gives special status to women’s feelings and intuitions) and the *feminist theory of social work*  (interests of women and children are synonymous, social workers should  identify with their female customers). It also includes stereotypes that  women are unselfish, peaceful, responsible, loving, hard working, while  men are the opposite (pp. 149–152). The **anti-sexist branch of feminism** by  definition is less hostile towards men as people, but it is not  necessarily able or willing to accept men’s issues: “\[i\]n general, the  idea of the discrimination of men is perceived as bizarre by feminists”  (pp. 155–158). The **sexist branch of masculism** is discussed primarily in the context of religion (pp. 144–129). The **anti-sexist branch of masculism** has  little power, although it is discussed as sometimes being the source of  biased statistics downplaying women’s issues (pp. 152–155).

The **alpha male bias** and **alpha female bias**  are the biases of high status (wealthy, powerful, attractive, etc.)  members of each gender against low status members of their gender. They  are particularly apparent in high status men’s bias against male  criminals (male judges giving harsher treatment, including sentences, to  them compared to women) and high status women’s bias against female  prostitutes (pp. 170–173).

A central point of this dissertation is that male-dominated and  female-dominated organizations (the patriarchal and matriarchal  subsystems) are prone to predominantly discriminate against the other  gender, but it’s important to clarify that they’re not *guaranteed*  to do so. The masculine and feminine biases (the unintentional “own  gender” biases) are just two of the six biases. An organization could be  more influenced by the ideological biases (masculist and feminist  biases) or the biases against low social status people of each gender  (alpha male and alpha female biases).

**Chapter 6: Locating the Patriarchal and Matriarchal Subsystems of the Finnish Society (p. 188)**

This chapter identifies Finnish society’s patriarchal and matriarchal  subsystems by looking at various measures of power, including raw  numbers, managerial positions, control of knowledge, and informal  positions of power (p. 222).

&#x200B;

* Patriarchal subsystem: technology, commerce, state finances,  defense, agriculture, transportation, trade, corporative labor and  employer organizations.
* Matriarchal subsystem: healthcare, social services, social policy,  equality policy, hotels, restaurants, and some cultural services.

Not all areas of Finnish society fall into one of these subsystems.

**Chapter 7: An Empirical Examination of the Memeplexes, Discourses and Coalitions that Induce Discrimination against Men (p. 224)**

This chapter analyzes the discourses that justify discrimination  against men, coming from sources that include sexism and feminism.

**Sexism:** The development of the modern misandric  versions of sexism is examined, including 19th century views of men as  “barbarians whose urges had to be leashed in by the forces of  decency—meaning women—if civilization were to survive” (p. 233), which  it attributes to the joint interests of women and upper class men.  Notions of chivalry and macho masculinity also lead to institutionalized  belief systems where men’s comfort, health, and even lives are  considered less important than women’s (p. 238). Macho masculinity, with  its aversion to men “complaining”, tends to oppose talking about men’s  issues or seeing them as relevant for gender equality (p. 306).

**Feminism:** Certain influential varieties of feminism see women as *the*  disadvantaged and discriminated gender (p. 247). Thus the sole purpose  of equality policy is women’s advancement (p. 256) and men are largely  reduced to the role of defendant (p. 270). When faced with cases  requiring a choice between *promotion of equality* and *empowerment of women*,  many feminists reacted by rejecting equality as outdated or as a  smokescreen for promoting men’s interests over women. Under these  discourses, “the empowerment of women is more important than the  advancement of gender equality in all contexts, including the  matriarchal subsystem of the society” (pp. 259–260). That would apply  even to women’s advantage in family courts and criminal courts (p. 305).

Also mentioned is a combination (and mutation) of difference feminism  and equality feminism which says that “women are superior to men in  many ways, but men are not superior to women in any ways” (p. 296)—which  means that when men are ahead it’s because of sexism, but when women  are ahead it is legitimate and natural.

The groups and alliances that justify misandry and discrimination against men (p. 334):

**Chapter 8: Gender Discrimination, According to the Complaints Sent to the Finnish Equality Ombudsman (p. 346)**

**Complaints:** This chapter analyzes 800 complaints of  gender discrimination made between 1997 and 2004 and sent to the Finnish  equality ombudsman (p. 348). Men were 33% of victims, according to the  author’s suggestion for the best measure of actual discrimination in  these cases (outcome types 3–5, p. 356). Labour market discrimination,  the largest category, primarily involved women (76%), while the second  largest category, discrimination against customers, primarily involved  men (\~60%).

Another category, discriminative legislation, primarily involved men  (77%). Few complaints were made, but due to active conscription policies  (lasting [5-12 months](http://puolustusvoimat.fi/documents/1948673/2015517/MAAVE-Varusmies-EN-19052017/4baabd0e-7545-428f-8e05-73735cd5817e)),  almost all men in Finland are affected by discriminative legislation.  The author classifies these complaints as discrimination, although the  equality ombudsman does not, “as the Finnish equality law is not  applicable to men’s obligatory military service” (p. 354).

**Bias:** Per chapter 6, equality policy itself is in  the matriarchal subsystem of equality (e.g., 90% of employees in the  equality ombudsman office are female, p. 354). The ombudsman has a  policy not to comment on complaints involving custody and divorce,  purportedly to not interfere with the court system, but the author  suggests that it stems from a bias against men, perhaps due to  prioritizing women’s status over equality or wanting to avoid a flood of  complaints from men (p. 354). This is made more explicit by another  comment from the ombudsman’s office saying that it is not taking action  on certain cases of discrimination against men because “the main purpose  of the equality law is to improve women’s status especially in the  labor market”, suggesting that the law should be applied more strictly  to cases of discrimination against women (p. 381).

**Patriarchal & matriarchal subsystems:** 57% of  discrimination cases in the matriarchal subsystem of society (as defined  in chapter 6) were against men, compared to 31% in neutral domains, and  17% in the patriarchal subsystem of society (p. 358).

**Discrimination examples:** Many cases of  discrimination against women (e.g., a workplace that only required women  to do extra cleaning tasks on top of their regular duties) are  recounted on the same pages but we’ll look at men here.

&#x200B;

* **In the labour market:** At a mental hospital, only  men were appointed to night shifts (p. 374). At a school, preference was  given to hiring female teachers even though men are the  “underrepresented” gender (p. 376). Many traditionally feminine jobs  excluded men in their recruitment material (p. 377). A workplace allowed  women to wear more casual and comfortable clothing than men (p. 377).
* **As customers:** Favourable pricing for women in boat  cruises, discotheques & dancing places, dating services, gymnastics,  a theatre, restaurants, horse races, and car insurance (pp. 380–382).  Also more strict clothing standards for men at a casino, higher minimum  ages for men to enter restaurants, and an apartment that only allowed  women (pp. 382–383).
* **Government administration:** Subsidy for  women’s osteoporosis medicines but not men’s (from pension fund), free  public screening for breast cancer but not prostate cancer, higher  retirement age for men (which has been changed) (pp. 387–389).
* **Legislation:** Men’s complaints were all about the  obligatory military or civil service of six to thirteen months (those  who refuse get six months in prison, p. 390).

**Likely motives:** Two alternative rating methods  (tables 52 and 53) find that either (certain) feminist ideas are the  most common motivators of discrimination against men, or sexism and the  feminine bias are the most common motivators (feminine bias meaning  unintentional gender bias of groups of women, counterpart to masculine  bias of groups of men). Financial motives were also frequent (pp.  401-402).",TRUE,105,0.95,7,,/r/MensRights/comments/jrxoy1/an_excellent_comprehensive_phd_research_on/,mhelena9201

This has happened. The campaign depicted the rough drawing of a fist going towards a crying eye. It was so blatantly anti-male that they had to pull back ""to avoid any controversy over the meaning of the message"". The very major declared: ""I will say this as a father. The decision to withdraw a campaign that gave such a confusing message to society was the right one"".

And much more. This is to say that, well. I do not know to which extent, I don't know if it's the same out there, wherever you are. But here, in Spain, where feminism has grown into a part of our state, our minds, our institutions, it has grown to be a direct obstacle thrown into equality. The moment they had enough power to stop fearing coming across as ""misandrist"" the mask was taken off.

One tactic used by feminists against men is bringing up a long dead state of society : THE PATRIARCHY ! Whenever you see yourself confronting such argument, DON'T ! It's dead. Don't lower yourself to their level. 

 ""A system of society or government in which the father or eldest male is head of the family and descent is reckoned through the male line."" - Uhm, how many decades ago was this a thing ? Explains why Game of Thrones was so popular, it was set in 2020, oh wait.

"" A system of society or government in which men hold the power and women are largely excluded from it. "" -  Women can choose ANY path in life they want, NOBODY is stopping them. They just feel entitled to free stuff and cry ""muh feelings"" when they don't get it. 

"" Traditional **patriarchal** societies are, usually, also patrilineal — titles and property are inherited through male **lines**. "" - Ehm, no. Women can inherit property or titles if they qualify for such. 

There...3 ""muh patriarchy"" rules that don't exist anymore.

11/11/2020 6:37,could someone help me on my essay about how men are more likely to lose in court?,"I wanna get this done as quick as possible so that I can move on to other schoolwork. This is for my US Government class. Make sure to leave a link to the sources. I will make sure to try and change some words up to avoid plagiarization. Here are the sentences I am using as the basis for three paragraphs.

&#x200B;

 

Ever since modern day feminism started, men's rights have been getting disregarded and women are being sexist towards men. Men's rights are getting looked down upon and the men in society are getting unfairly punished for it. 

One example of sexism against men is that if a woman writes a man's name down for a child that isn't his, the man still has to pay child support. In the past few years, there has been a bias against men in divorce courts.

Another example is that in most divorce cases the woman gets 90% of belongings plus the children. 

Yet another example is that if a man gets accused of false rape, the man will have their lives ruined in most situations even if the woman doesn't have any evidence.

&#x200B;

The essay only needs an intro, 3 paragraphs that contain one point to talk about, and a conclusion.

Edit: Thanks for the good sources, people! I will definitely look into them tommorrow",TRUE,11,0.87,6,,/r/MensRights/comments/jrvcmv/could_someone_help_me_on_my_essay_about_how_men/,Easiestcc

If you can check it out, read online about it but I will warn you. A lot of posts and reveiws I have read often fail to highlight *or* mention this being about the unconscentual sex between a minor and an adult (Rape is what you would absolutley call it) and only brief it as a ""inappropriate relationship"". 


This is astounding to me. It makes me sick to my stomach because; instead of raising full awareness about these types of rape cases it *actively* misidentifies it and likely *infatuates* this type of rape to others who may view the material without fully understanding what it is.

The worst part is it deligitimizes those of whom have suffered trauma as a direct cause of the teacher or an other authority figure raping a child.

She claimed she remembered the date somehow even though she could not remember the year.

Luckily thousands of guys flooded the comments putting the 🧢 emoji(cap). The day she claimed the rape took place we were playing Fortnite(forgive me) and he had done a nice match and posted it to YouTube for us to see. Glad the guy is ok. A lot of girls believe her but we outnumbered them.

11/11/2020 8:26,False accusations happen to women too,"I would have posted this in r/FeMRADebates but as they don't allow anonymous throwaways and I feel like I need to use one, I will post it here instead. I also want to say that it's not in any way my intention to minimize or take a way from anyone's experience of rape or false accusations. My intention is to share something that happened to my friend that shows that false accusations (just as rape) is not a gendered issue but something that can happen to anyone.

My friend and I are both women in our early 20s. A few days ago we went to a house party (in violation of COVID restrictions) with a bunch of other people we know to varying degrees. We only stayed for about an hour and left together. I'm completely certain my friend was never out of my sight for more than 10 minutes at the time and pretty sure she never went upstairs but the next day we are told that a guy has accused her of raping him in an upstairs bedroom. I'm not going to repeat his description of events but they are detailed and describe something that must have taken more than 10 minutes.

I know for a fact that what he says can't possibly be true but everyone believes him and think I'm lying to protect my friend. More than one person has told me that a man would never lie about being raped because nobody would believe him and he would be ridiculed but everyone is believing him and nobody is ridiculing him.

I don't want to call him a liar either because maybe he was raped by someone else and misidentified my friend but nobody is willing to consider any alternative.

I know this is not a typical situation and that men who are raped often are ridiculed and not believed. That's horrible and I'm in no way advocating against male victims of rape but false accusations are often portrayed as a specifically male issue and I wanted to point out that it affects women too.

So this whole thing started with me posting ""Does it scare you that a woman can ruin a mans life with no evidence?"" 

In the post i went on to mention Johnny Depp and his current situation with him and his wife. Johnny depp got accused of being a wife beater by a news outlet called The Sun. Johnny filed for defamation and his wife started playing the victim card. She later admitted to throwing things like pots at his head. Depp still got punished even though there was LITERAL EVIDENCE of his wife beating him and his wife got away with it with no punishment. If that dosen't tell you that our law system is corrupt, i dont know what will.

The mods took the post down saying that it had a ""personal agenda"". I messaged the mods in a sort of ""Hey what the hell mods?"" kinda way.

They later started saying stuff like ""Stop shitting on the carpet and go back to whatever MGTOW perpetual victimhood echo chamber you slithered out from"".

R A P E RAPE. Anyway he got her pregnant. So what she did was she said that he raped her and took it to court. She obviously won the case because she is a pregnant woman and now for the rest of his life, that man has to live with a criminal record.

1) Do nothing because these things often resolve on their own in cases like his.

2) Use a cortisone cream to expedite the process of loosening it for 30 days.

3) Surgery.

Doc leaned toward doing nothing or cream. I decided to use the cream because it's pretty harmless. The surgeon chose not to set a f/u appointment until the end of the 30 days. After twice a day application for a week, my son retracted it. Surgery is not needed to fix a foreskin that won't retract the majority of the time.

10/11/2020 0:46,Is this Violence Index from my country (Brazil) gender biased?,"A few months ago an official organization from the Brazilian government released this [Violence Index](https://www.ipea.gov.br/atlasviolencia/download/27/atlas-da-violencia-2020-principais-resultados) (in Portuguese).

There's a section for violence against women in which is said (p. 11) that ""Every 2h, a woman in Brazil is killed"" and ""Every 6h23, a woman is killed inside her house"", according to numbers from 2018.

I couldn't find, throughout the document, any explanation to follow these numbers. I mean, numbers alone don't mean much, do they? How am I suppose to know if these numbers are high? That's what they are suggesting, right?

With that in mind, I began searching for the numbers for men in these specific situations. In 2018, 57,956 people were killed throughout the country (p. 7), from which 4,519 were women (p. 11). So, it's reasonable to assume 53,437 were men. Wow ok, that's a pretty big difference there. About 92% of homicide victims in Brazil are male.

So, actually they try to provide an explanation for the phenomenon, which is that the percentage of women killed inside their houses is 38.9% of the overall number of female victims of homicide, while the percentage of men killed inside their houses is 14.4% of the overall number of male victims of homicide (p. 11), implying that domestic violence is more of an issue for women than it is for men. Right, I think you guys can identify the problem here. 14.4% of 53,437 (7,695) is WAY greater a number than 38.9% of 4,519 (1,758).\* Hell, the number of men killed inside their homes is almost twice as the number of women killed in any place.

Every 10 minutes, a man in Brazil is killed. Every 1h08, a man is killed in his house.

Why didn't they explicit these numbers like they did with the ones from women? Were they afraid people would think men suffer the most from violence? If that is a misinterpretation, why not include an explanation? Is it possible that violence towards men actually is more of an issue than violence towards women? Is this research really just feminist propaganda?

Those were the questions that came to my mind, but what do you guys think? Am I missing something? Is my logic flawed at some point? Am I actually the one so biased that can't see something obvious about this whole matter?

\*They also say the number of women killed inside their homes is 1,373 (p. 11), which is even lower than what I calculated and corresponds to 30.4% of the overall number.

9/11/2020 15:44,What's your opinion on feminism and it's value to men?,"Hi, I do not usually read this sub so this is a bit of an outsider post, I was wondering what everyone here thinks of feminism. Full disclosure I am a feminist and an advocate for men's liberation (if you aren't familiar with it, you can think of it as a movement built on feminist theory to advocate for men's rights) - to be clear I probably agree with all the issues that you have with the way society treats men, definitely all those listed on the side bar.

Feminism has two main parts, the movement which advocates from women's rights, and the academic side which covers gender theory and even intersectionality. How do you feel about either side? Do you feel supported or antagonized by the movement? Have you found the academia useful or harmful?

&#x200B;

To get started on the post, I will give you my opinion:

Feminism as a movement should support men in theory, but historically feminism has had some troubles with non-female issues. For example, there are feminists who are racist, sexist, or transphobic. In many community trans-exclusionary feminists (TERFs) are kicked out. There has been problems with ""white feminism"" too, which is essentially a refusal to deal with intersectional issues with solidarity. Likewise, there are many feminists who are not interested in men's issues, and may even actively oppose them for various (IMO misguided) reasons. I know I have experienced hate from self-identified feminists many  many times, I am sure I am not alone here. Ultimately, Men's liberation should be lead by men, the feminist movement isn't the right vehicle to progress men's rights. Although I do expect feminists to be allies and advocates for equality for men too.

Now, feminist academia on the other hand is a lot more useful. Concepts\* like privilege, toxic masculinity, gender, or intersectionality are powerful tools. Using them means not having to invent them ourselves. That's why I take the view that men's lib is a good way forward, it's men's rights built on feminist foundations. Sure, more work is needed, especially from a male perspective, but it's a valuable starting point.

^(\*I know some of feminist terms may be controversial, and I am sure you have heard misandrists misusing these terms in a hateful way, so let me quickly say: privilege means advantage, everyone has various privileges thanks to their race, gender, class, etc, endless attributes. Everyone has privilege, everyone lacks some privileges that some other people have. Toxic masculinity means that some part of the gender role is not good for men or for society, eg the idea that men are violent - what a dumb thing to generalize about the whole gender. Gender refers to the way society expects people to act based on their sex, obviously men can act however they want so the entire concept is flawed. Intersectionality means systems of oppression can combine, eg if you are a man you face certain pressures, but if you are homeless man then you are even worse off.)",TRUE,2,0.53,224,,/r/MensRights/comments/jqthbf/whats_your_opinion_on_feminism_and_its_value_to/,fgyoysgaxt

8/11/2020 15:22,"My boyfriend has been accused of ""sexual assault"" by my ex best friend.","Flashback to October 26th, 2020... my birthday. The day I didn't realize was going to change the dynamic of my relationships forever. I was living in an apartment with three other girls, I'll call them Janice, Yvette, and Maddie. I wanted to have a birthday celebration there, so I invited my boyfriend over. Janice's friend, we'll call them Emma, was also invited. I had known Yvette and Maddie since the beginning of my Freshman year, and Yvette was my dorm-mate. I'm now a Sophomore in college. 





Anyways, back to the story, Yvette, Janice, Maddie, Emma, myself, and my boyfriend, we'll call him Kam, were all drinking vigorously that night, some more than others. Yvette and myself got trashed off a bottle of tequila and half a bottle of rum. We were certainly the ones drinking the most out of the group: probably 10-15 shots each. My boyfriend, Kam, had maybe 4 or 5, Janice had one or two, Emma had about two, and Maddie no shots. Instead, Maddie, Janice, and Emma opted for a glass or two of wine. All of the girls, including myself, but not Kam, were also heavily snorting a drug called Poppers, an inhalant. 




The night was so fun in the beginning: Yvette and I were having a ball, dancing around, and chatting it up with the other girls. We had a heart to heart talk in the kitchen about how much we loved each other and were glad we met each other, and she even yelled how happy she was that I had found an amazing boyfriend. Through the duration of this chat in the kitchen, my boyfriend was holding both of us up as we were a danger to ourselves being clumsy drunks and falling all over the place. We even had somewhat of a group hug. 




Shortly after this, is when things started to go bad. Yvette was viciously throwing up in the bathroom, and while this is nothing new to the girls of the apartment and we know she usually likes to be left alone in this event, of course my boyfriend had no idea how to react. His natural instinct, as a kind and caring person, was to check on her. He rubbed her back while she was puking until she assured him that she was okay. The girls told him to leave her alone as that is what she prefers in this situation, but they clearly were not aware of the severity, as Yvette had literal alcohol poisoning and this will be apparent later on. 




Once more after that, Kam knocked on the door again to double-check, to which she replied she was fine. He did not enter the bathroom at this point. Later in the blur of the night, Yvette suddenly got quiet and Kam got worried as none of the other girls were making a conscious effort to check on her, so he once again entered the bathroom (in which I had left the door open since I was going in and out constantly throughout the duration of this.) Because the door was already left open by me, he noticed Yvette lying in the bathtub unconscious (which I hadn't even noticed all the times I went in since I was so drunk.) She had vomited all over herself, and her pants were off, along with poop all over the toilet seat. She also had a broken glass underneath her, somewhat near her lady parts and butt but not close enough to have to physically touch her body in order to grab it. Kam, worried and not knowing what to do as none of the others seemed to be taking it seriously, grabbed the largest piece of the glass and showed it to the other girls to let them know that they needed to take care of her. When he showed the girls the glass, and began heading back to my bedroom, they told him that they were pissing them off and that he needed to leave because he was making them uncomfortable for ""checking on her so much."" He only saw her with her pants off the one time, because the door was left open, and before that he only checked on her the two times I described. 




The way the girls told me the story, he checked on her   ""twelve times,"" in order to ""look at her naked,"" when they were not paying attention to who was going in and out of the bathroom and they were likely mistaking my trips to the bathroom as him. They claimed to have told him to stop checking multiple times, and even fabricated a version of the story in their heads where they ""caught him standing over her in the bathroom."" This obviously never happened, because if it did, he would have been asked to leave immediately, not after he had pulled a broken glass out from the tub. 




Janice claimed she had been checking on Yvette every five minutes, and he had no reason to want to check on her in the first place, but if this was the case, Yvette would not have been found in this condition by my boyfriend. Janice also claims that the reason Yvette was throwing up in the first place was because my boyfriend was ""roughly grabbing her waist,"" when he was holding us up in the kitchen. Again, why would you tell me how happy you were that I had an amazing boyfriend WHILE he's doing something that allegedly makes you so sick you need to puke? No girl, I'm pretty sure you had to puke because of all the alcohol. Also, what gives Yvette the right to monopolize the bathroom with her drunken self when there are guests who may need to use it? 




Fast forward to the next day, my boyfriend explains to me what happened, telling me that the girls were accusing him of being a pervert and I ask Yvette if she is ok over text. I also let her know that he had no weird intentions and was simply concerned for her safety and was trying to help. Now, I understand it may not have been the best idea to reach in and grab the glass, and he probably should have asked the girls to do so, but in the heat of the moment, he only had good intention by doing so. After I told her what happened with the glass, she said ""He's your boyfriend, he wasn't gonna like try to do anything besides help your friend."" I then said it was annoying the way they were attempting to frame him, to which she replied ""For real, and he isn't going to leave his drunk girlfriend to help another drunker girl."" 




Throughout the course of the next couple of weeks, I was feeling extreme tension with the girls and it was clear there was some type of issue that wasn't being brought up. Then, all of a sudden one day, Yvette claims to have trauma and PTSD from the event, claiming she was certainly sexually assaulted by him for ""looking at her naked,"" and ""touching her to grab the glass,"" when in fact she was never touched, as can be proved by the remaining glass shards that were underneath her. She claims to have been conscious enough to know he was constantly checking on her: (probably me going pee,) and there's no way as she had ACTUAL alcohol poisoning, but I know she has that idea in her head because of the way Janice spun the story to tell her. If the human brain doesn't remember a sequence of events, and someone fills it in for you, you will psychologically believe it actually happened, which I think is what happened to Yvette. 




Janice is very good at spinning and manipulating stories, likely in relation to her BPD. If he truly was attempting to touch her, he would have brought out not only the main piece of the glass, but the shards as well. And why would he SHOW the girls the glass and explain the situation if he was really attempting something malicious? Also, I know my boyfriend was not about to be attracted by a girl with puke all over herself, sorry lol. I asked them this same question, to which they said he had it all planned out and that was his scapegoat for not looking like a creep. Yeah, totally, because he PLANNED to have to deal with a girl passed out in the bathtub with puke and broken glass all over her, please. 




Of course Yvette is embarrassed, as anyone would be in that situation, and of course it's not fun to know someone has seen you with your pants off, but she put herself in that situation and it does not make my boyfriend a sexual assaulter. 




Upon further talking with the girls, they explained that he should have known that she wouldn't be comfortable with a man looking at her naked, when first of all he had no clue upon entering the bathroom that she was even in the tub, let alone with her pants off. He was WORRIED, bottom line. They also claimed that I am a woman hater and a victim shamer for not believing them, when they obviously were not paying attention to the course of events throughout the duration of the night as well as they assume. ""He should have let the 'sober' girls handle it instead of reaching into the tub and looking at her,"" they preached over and over, when everyone was intoxicated to some degree. 




I told them that I know this boy, and he is not a pervert, he is not a sexual assaulter, he has always been helpful and respectful and would never do something like this with bad intention. It was all coming from a place of genuine worry and concern. I was also called an idiot, told they had lost all respect for me, among several other insults. Obviously talking amongst themselves for a week and fabricating the story in their head has convinced them that this was a real event. I was mainly shocked by Yvette, as she had claimed everything was fine the next day and out of nowhere now has PTSD. 




The next morning after the talk with them, I decided to take some stuff and leave to my aunt's house as I did not feel comfortable in that apartment anymore. I have to go back and get the rest eventually, as well as find someone to sublet the apartment, which really sucks because I am liable for rent payment until I do. After I left, I was bombarded with texts like ""How could you do this to me, I thought we were friends,"" ""Why would I lie about this,"" ""Have fun staying with a sexual assaulter,"" ""You're disgusting,"" and many more. It's just a mess of a situation and my boyfriend does not deserve any of this for simply trying to help. 




I just needed to explain the situation somewhere, as this is all completely crazy to me and it absolutely baffles me how easy it is to manipulate people into believing your version of a story (Janice DOES make it sound extremely convincing, however.) 




So, I've lost three friendships with girls I thought I was close to all because they wanted to attack my boyfriend for trying to do a good thing. I'm not even sad about it, though, because clearly these girls were never my friends in the first place. 




My boyfriend and I are just slightly worried, because in one of the texts, Yvette said she can and probably will take her claim to the police. I know I shouldn't be too worried as there is no proof and everyone was intoxicated, but it is still alarming to know that you would go to that length on the grounds of a story someone else told you.",TRUE,42,0.89,37,,/r/MensRights/comments/jq7n9i/my_boyfriend_has_been_accused_of_sexual_assault/,ultravioletocean

8/11/2020 10:01,Sexually assaulted and neglected.,"TL;DR at bottom.

So basically last week today my friend (female) invited me to her house for a bit because it was my birthday.  So I drive over, her house being a long ways but I was going to stay the night.  I knock on the door then she opens it and there’s decorations everywhere and a whole bunch of my friends (most people were hers though, no biggie).  This will be important later because technically you shouldn’t have massive gatherings.  So party goes on basic stuff but this one woman was always looking at me and so were her friends and they were winking and shit.  Kind of felt like they were undressing me with their eyes.  This woman comes over and congratulates me and stuff and we get to know each other.  She offers to get me a drink so I say yes please and she gets me one.  I drink it and I am pretty sure that she put something in it ( no alcohol it was Pepsi).  I get extremely dizzy and she asks if it would be okay to go to the guest room with me, I would have said no but her and her friends insisted and I felt like utter crud so we went up.  I wake up later to find her on top of me and playing with my penis.  I try and shove her off but I am way too weak because of god knows what was in the drink.  I shout for help to which a load of people barge in and look at me.  THEY START LAUGHING, EVEN MY FRIEND!  As if it wasn’t bad enough they got out their phones.  I threatened to call the police but they threw my phone out the bloody window and it smashed, just like that they had totally fucked me up and I feel as though I can never trust anyone again.  So after that I threw her as hard as I could off the bed... SHE STARTED CRYING AND EVERYONE SAID I WAS MEAN.  Pissed, I managed to get out of there and find a place on the road to sleep in my car.  THEY ALSO GAVE ME COVID!  IT FEELS LIKE CRAAAAAPPP!  Later I called the police and said everything and I will be taking the woman to court next month for assault and destruction of property.  Now I am getting bombarded with emails saying how heartless I am and that it was all just a party.  Fuck you Elizabeth and fuck you Joan!

But, Does my husband do some of the typical stuff like needing to “ poop for 45 minutes” when I need him to do something, yes, but he also will get out of the bathroom and do it. Lol. I should also say that I know my husband is going to take turns getting up with our baby. Do men just not do their fair share and women are upset? Or are women just being ungrateful? I’m unsure but I absolutely hate that and if roles were reversed all hell would break loose.

**Androphobia** is defined as a fear of men. The term originated inside feminist and lesbian-feminist movements to balance the opposite term “gynophobia,” which means a fear of women. Misandry, another term that arose from the feminist and lesbian-feminist movements, is defined as a hatred of men.

Here's articles about it:

I believe there are lots of things feminism has done right, but the recent radicalization and what seems to be a push not for women but against men is not one of them.

They are hurting their cause, our cause and everyone who really seeks an equal society.

It should be anti feminist to say ""women can't be abusers, rapists, or discriminate"" because by doing that you are taking away the human part of women: they can make mistakes, they can have evil intentions, they can be bad people just as we men can, and not recognizing that fact is a direct aggresion to themselves and our seeked equalness.

If both your biological parents have a recessive phenotype, but you do not, then assuming the observation is correct, those two people can't be your biological parents.  
>  
>Sometimes the hospital discovers by accident that the person listed as father can't be the biological father; for example if the bloodtype of the child is an impossibility with him as dad; in such cases they deliberately AVOID informing him about it.

7/11/2020 6:05,Ran over in court,"Hi All - - 

Jesus what a crappy two years I've had, covid aside. 

I made a stupid mistake and dated a woman at the same company I worked at. This company makes a very well known product that you'd recognize instantly if I told you what it was. This is in LA. 

I only dated this woman for two months before I ended things because her behavior was getting very erratic, crazy and at times downright scary. She would scream bloody murder at me for trivial things (for example she found out that I didn't eat a pop tart she had given me one day and completely lost it. She even threatened suicide because of this...). She would also beat herself in the face when she was upset. This is from a woman who appeared completely normal when I first met her. 

Anyways, I break up with her and she starts parking next to me at work every day. She starts putting things on my car. Come to find out she moved 2 miles down the street from me, IN LA, after we broke up. At work she would come to my department and stare at me. She started spending a-lot of time with other guys at work and most likely slept with a couple of them. This bothered me, because there was a time when I really liked this girl. At first I felt bad for her, but then quickly realized that she was a predator in every sense of the word. 

When it became clear to her that I wanted nothing to do with her, she then switched her tune. She started trying to get me in trouble at work. She filed police reports for me over stuff I had not done. She even started following me home from work. Then, she started popping up around my neighborhood at places I would be at. 

I went to management about her on numerous occasions and they eventually sat down and spoke with her. She even ADMITTED to putting stuff on my car, but they didn't fire her. I sh\*t you not. Now, imagine if I had put stuff on her car? LOL, I would have been fired instantly. But she's a female, so I guess the rules don't apply to her. The HR director even told me, behind closed doors of course, that they ""Just didn't want a lawsuit"". 

I kept complaining to them about her and finally they fired me. They said it was due to ""Sale restructuring"". This was 2 months after I had gotten a significant raise and bonus. It was a total cover up. 

So, long story short, I got another job pretty quickly. I was majorly pissed off at what had happened to me at this company, but I was trying my best to just move on a forget it. You know, focus on my new job and just move on. Two months later, I step outside of my apartment to go across the street and get some snacks at the convenience store across the street. Guess who I see? Her and another guy I used to work with slowly drive by me as I'm walking out. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first, but told myself maybe I was just seeing things. But, 2 days later it happened again. I sent her a text and told her to f\*ck off and called her a mentally ill sl\*t, because she is. I even texted the guy who drove by with her that he was more than welcome to get out of the car next time so I could kick his ass. 

A week later, I check my mailbox and find a cease and desist letter from my last company. The letter told me if I even contacted anyone at that job again that I would get sued. I had had enough and went down to the courthouse and filed for a restraining order on her. To my surprise, it was fully granted. The only thing is, in California, you still have to have a hearing to make it permanent. 

&#x200B;

So the day of the hearing comes up and I show up to court alone. I'm thinking this will be easy. She shows up with a lawyer, a bunch of her family members and a new black boyfriend. She gives me this evil smile as she walks into the court. I decide at this point that I need to get an attorney too as she is there claiming I'm the one who's been harassing her. So we have the hearing, at a later date, and her and her family get on the stand and basically make me out to be a monster. They tell the judge that she's deathly afraid of me. Those texts I sent to her and that guy who drove by my place? Yeah, that came back to bite me. The judge kept saying he didn't believe me when I told him how crazy she was. I even had a ton of evidence on her (texts talking about how she hits herself in the face, texts talking about how she put stuff on my car, etc.). I have pictures of her parking next to me at work every day. 

&#x200B;

It didn't matter. My lawyer even called in witnesses from my last company, several people from upper management. They were totally useless. Every other word they said was ""I don't recall"" or ""I don't remember"". When my lawyer asked them about her admitting to putting stuff on my car at work, they all said the same bullsh\*t, ""I don't recall"". 

&#x200B;

So what happens? The judge slaps me with a 4 year protective order. The judge called ME the stalker in court. The only good thing is that it's not a criminal order, it's civil. So it won't show up on a background check for criminal stuff. Also, I already have another job, so I'm not worried about it as far as looking for work goes. 

&#x200B;

The next thing you know, she's all over social media talking about her ""Big win"" in court and how she's now finally able to move on with her life. And of course, all her enablers were congratulating her on social media. 

&#x200B;

I had no idea this kind of evil existed. I mean even while I was waiting to go back to court, this woman was still doing drive bys of my apartment and showing up at places in my neighborhood. The only difference was she was showing up in different cars. They were these real beat up junky looking cars. No idea where she got them from. This was while I had a restraining order on her. 

&#x200B;

I guess I'm wondering if this is really even over or if she's going to try and get me in further trouble. I have a feeling she might be done now. But you never know.

6/11/2020 7:21,Feminists unknowingly work against their own Goals,"Despite all the Venom Feminists spew, they do want to solve *some* genuine Women's issues such as the cultural stereotype of Women being incapable of taking on the role of  rugged individuals&breadwinners, however it is the feminists who perpetuate this notion in the first place. Feminists work tirelessly to maintain the Victimhood narrative of Women as an oppressed ""Class"", how can the average person(including girls) perceive Women as strong, capable individuals when they're also helpless subjects of this all-encompassing, omnipresent patriarchy demon? You can't be Victims without agency AND also be strong individuals who can bring change to the world, you can't have it both ways.

**For ex:**Let's take the case of the Incels&the bogey of Male Violence.  Feminists overblow *ANY* instance of Male anger&violence as some world ending force of nature that is to be feared 24/7 365 days and then, they go on to complain about how Women's anger is seen as ""hysteria"".  I wonder *why*, could it be because you(Feminists) elevate every single case of Male Anger&Discontent as this diabolic threat while simultaneously justifying&downplaying Female Agency,Anger&Violence? We hear it Ad Nauseam, **""Always hold back against Women because they're Weaker""** but what about Men who are also weaker?  I'm weaker than the average guy and yet my threats will be treated with seriousness and they won't ""hold back"". Feminists want Women to be treated like Adult Children instead of people who can take adversity on the chin just like any man.  Feminists are the type of people who insist on using training wheels while also demanding to be seen as a ""Cool Biker"". 

This crusade against ""Toxic"" Masculinity is just Feminists being frustrated with their inability to elevate Women's Image in a way they see fit, if they didn't demonize Masculinity and saw the positives in Responsibility&Stoicism, they could actually help Women for once. Feminists would rather force men to be overemotional&docile than encourage Women to be self-sufficient and in control of their emotions, you know? The qualities that are expected from Leaders&CEOs. If you(feminists) keep insisting that Women are incapable of having agency&power in Society unless Men ""make room"" and let go of their patriarchal superpowers, you've condemned all Women to the status of perpetual fear,helplessness&grievance. Women can never have agency because if they did, then that means the ""Patriarchy Demon"" doesn't exist and your entire belief system is built on lies. If ANYONE is perpetuating the stereotype of meek, helpless damsels incapable of adulting&emotional fortitude, its the Feminists who refuse to acknowledge Women's agency&responsibility(POWER) in Society.

**P.S:** To any Feminist reading this, the problems Men&Women face cannot be boiled down to ""Because Patriarchy"" or ""Because Missogeny"", that's extremely reductionist.

So time goes past fasting forward to like 2 months later, this guy comes up to me and says “hey mind if you come with me for a second...” and tells me privately “these to girls are filing a report against you” and I looked at him confused and he says “yeah trust me I get it, and it’s most likely nothing...” and I respond with “I only talk to like 2-3 people here” and he tells me “they’re saying you’re following them around.” And I tell this guy “this is fucking stupid, how am I following them around while doing my fucking job” and he goes again “yeah I get it, it’s probably nothing”, so I go into this room much like you’ll see on some tv show where a guy is being interrogated, this woman on the larger side comes in along with the same guy, and I’m just there with a resting bitch face, and she says “so these two girls are claiming that you’re following them around, and we would just like to hear your side of the story....”  (i don’t remember the rest) and I just tell them “I just come here, clock in, do my job....” what I tell them is what is mentioned in this post already, and the lady goes “you’re the calmest person we’ve ever had in this room” and I just simply respond with “well yeah because I didn’t do anything” and so they have me file a report telling my side of the story (which is what I just told them) and I also make the comment “this is so stupid” and the guy says “just use a different break room” 

I wasn’t fired or received any infractions or anything for it, they did still continue to investigate (they made it super obvious), the two girls who filed the report said that they kept seeing me everywhere thinking I was following them so they filed a report to HR......and YEAH YOU KEPT SEEING ME EVERYWHERE BECAUSE OUR DEPARTMENTS ARE RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER AND WE USE THE SAME FUCKING BREAKROOM (the break room that isn’t as crowded and not even close to being as loud and is much much closer to both of our departments) AND WE’RE ON THE SAME FUCKING SHIFTS, also there were many times to where I would go from one department to another because I was crossed trained in 3 different departments, my main department was in two parts of the place I worked in, and 1 of the other departments and jobs I did during my time there BOTH were in their department, so I seriously still wonder what made them think they were seeing me everywhere??? since then I just avoided them completely, and this still pisses me off because I actually offered shit and was more nice than I usually am to one of them by offering her food, I saw who they both were because I saw them writing their statements in front of HR,

TL;DR two girls make a report about me following them, I get investigated, turns out it was nothing, 
they kept seeing me everywhere because I’m crossed trained in multiple departments including the one they work in so regularly I would go over there to help out their department, we also used the same break room Because it’s by far much closer to both of our departments which saves time, and has less people, and is by far less loud, I was even nice enough to offer one them food regularly because she would barely eat anything for whatever reason, I also saw them writing their statements so I knew who filed the report, 

(Rant) so now I’m working in a very similar job as to the one that this took place in, I avoid woman by all costs, unless it’s job related or I’m helping them (for whatever reason, but I still try to avoid even that) other than that I avoid them by all means, if I even hear anything about me (which I did, which is another story,) I’ll just get irritated but ignore it, (maybe confront her next time I overhear her to clear shit up and release frustration)",TRUE,97,0.96,26,,/r/MensRights/comments/jofv4i/not_sure_what_to_tag_this_actually_but_this_one/,xguy18

By a person who is powerless to translate his or her beliefs into institutional action.

It's perfectly true to say that there are as many nasty people on the antifeminist side as on the feminist. It's also true that in the developed world's halls of power, at all levels above rock bottom, antifeminist  people have to keep their thoughts hidden like atheists in Iran.

Literally all people who aspire to holding institutional power have to hide any antifeminist knowledge that they have. 

The reason it's absolutely right to criticize feminism more than the MRM is that the MRM has absolutely zero influence on policy formation. No matter what an antifeminist happens to think, it's completely irrelevant to public or corporate policy, because all people who don't publicly follow the current feminist party line are universally excluded from all administrative decision-making.

If a policy causes some harm, the  MRM is innocent, because absolutely nobody asked them for their input.
